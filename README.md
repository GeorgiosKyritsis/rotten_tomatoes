# Rotten Tomatoes Movie Reviews

This repository contains my analysis and fine-tuning of [Google's BERT Model](https://github.com/google-research/bert), that I used as a way to tackle this problem. My analysis can be found in src/predict_movie_reviews.ipynb jupyter notebook.

The pretrained model that I use can be downloaded by the following dropbox link:
[12-layer, 768-hidden, 12-heads, 110M parameters](https://www.dropbox.com/sh/gusqgm2sk5ixgbg/AAArsairmgeMEszvZ7h8TEYSa?dl=0) 441 MB

The outputs of my models (trained models, evaluation, test results) can be downloaded by the following dropbox link:
[out](https://www.dropbox.com/sh/25cv9wc78665diu/AABQQa2_Mrd9qwMwqNElkPqta?dl=0) 4.1 GB

Add both downloaded folders (best_pretrained_models, out) to src/bert_model folder.
