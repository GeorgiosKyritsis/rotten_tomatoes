0	4	a	Any student of rock history would have to be concerned that Hollywood might have only one chance to get this right. Cadillac Records doesn't manage that, but with this cast doing its own singing, and history this rich, it's close enough for rock 'n' roll.
1	4	a	Two thirds is so packed with charming characters, stellar visuals and sense of adventure, it makes that other third come across as much more of a failure than it really is.
2	5	a	a testament to Roberts' early star power and little else.
3	1	a	Though it runs slow at times, Down To The Bone showed more the emotional dehabilitation rather than the obvious physical ware drugs took on a small town mom... 
4	1	a	Bridges is another example of Eastwood's remarkable economy of style as both a director and an actor. It is neither his best work nor his worst, though it is a fascinating exploration.
5	2	a	Definitely a film to seek out if you enjoy quirky, creative projects outside of the norm.
6	1	a	Like the better films of Frank Capra, this movie combines irony and a humanist outlook with substantial social criticism.
7	3	a	If the opening scene of a film marks the first move of a grand seduction, David O. Russell scores a home run in the first five minutes of American Hustle.
8	0	a	Twenty five years after its original release, the boldly titled and definitive-sounding Final Cut has arrived, and thankfully, it boasts editorial polishes and technical upheavals that'll have George Lucas dashing back to the cutting room.
9	3	a	Hirsch may be the talk of Into the Wild, but Penn should be commended for putting together such a strong cast.
10	4	a	if only filmmakers out there would take a how-to course on making romantic comedies with more than just laughs and star appeal, we might actually be making some progress.
11	6	a	Hancock the jaunty, jokey riff on the screwed-up inner emotional life of a traditionally ironclad superhero becomes Hancock the icky lesson in the importance of personal responsibility, loyalty, and continued family togetherness.
12	10	a	Whatever they paid Canadian horror auteur David Cronenberg to appear in this godforsaken mess, it wasn't enough. 
13	3	a	David O. Russell's American Hustle is at times both deliciously sexy and hilariously unsexy in its attempt to portray the awful, scheming hustlers we all pretend not to be.
14	5	a	The Darkest Minds isn't just overtly derivative. It's happily, dully derivative too, barely trying to hide its patchwork narrative or the debt it owes to its many predecessors.
15	1	a	It works well enough, since the thrills pop up frequently, and the dispatching of the cast is as often imaginative as it is gory.
16	5	a	The film has so many moodswings that watching it induces whiplash, and just about everybody in it, from Winslet on down to Judy Davis, playing the dressmaker's crotchety mother, flagrantly overdoes it.
17	1	a	An alluring docudrama, with a sharp droll wit.
18	0	a	Mixes the bitter with the sweet and stays in the mind because it refuses to succumb to the cynicism that surrounds its protagonist.
19	6	a	How can a blood-soaked crime story take all the elements of classic neo-noir thrillers and become a perfect storm of tedium?
20	3	a	Hopkins and Mirren catch every nuance of resentment, anger, affection, and emotional interdependence while at the same time creating the sort of wrenching emotional suspense that Hitch put into his films
21	6	a	Ever hear someone tell supposedly amusing tales of their childhood and adolescence that seem only to hold the slightest bit of interest to the person telling the story?
22	6	a	click to read the full review
23	5	a	The same old 'people are lonely' whining, only with new technology.
24	7	a	While fastidiously made, McGregor's film is dramatically inert-a pretty but shallow rendering of Roth's novel.
25	2	a	Overlong, but any film that can make Brad Pitt look homely deserves to sweep the special effects awards.
26	1	a	Westfeldt is the pulse of Friends With Kids, presenting us with life in all of its vibrant, messy sprawl.
27	7	a	a haphazard mess with little regard for logic or plotting. This is for Bill Murray completists only...one must be a seriously invested viewer to find a chuckle here.
28	1	a	Midnight in Paris is a loving embrace of the city, of art and of life itself.
29	3	a	Still powerful expose of evangelism.
30	5	a	One of those average romantic comedies that Hollywood churns out several times a year like widgets on an assembly line.
31	3	a	"Tom Cruise's ego-driven ""Look at me; aren't I heroic?"" performance detracts, but it's just too compelling and the other performances too pitch-perfect for this to ruin things."
32	2	a	The journey is fairly uncharted ... [but] the heart is in the right place, although it makes for a curious watch.
33	3	a	This is a good script, good dialogue, funny even for adults. The characters are interesting and often very creatively constructed from figure to backstory. The film will play equally well on both the standard and giant screens.
34	3	a	"Bolstered by Thomas Newman's score, spot-on set design and the brilliant source material, ""Revolutionary Road"" is a darkly effective portrait of an Eisenhower-era couple who fall tragically short of reaching Camelot."
35	1	a	Atkinson's genius at portraying a pesky, childish adult is reminiscent of the great comic stars of silent movies, Buster Keaton and Charlie Chaplin.
36	2	a	For devotees of the much loved series, this long-awaited Veronica Mars feature film is a five-star proposition. For everyone else, Veronica Mars is a pleasant diversion.
37	3	a	It's good to see [Romero] back in the genre he invented with Night of the Living Dead, and still using zombies not simply for target practice but as a device for social satire.
38	4	a	Isn't going to win any awards, but it's a distinct step up from most striving-against-the-odds high school movies.
39	9	a	While it occasionally pulls away from Colvin to let the nightmarish inhumanity of war provide power and feeling, it all too often relies on juiced-up expressions of humanist heroism.
40	9	a	... [Russell] bullshits his way through the narrative, basically, giving his stellar cast plenty of room to improvise at length but in the end coming off as an indulgent storyteller unable to self-edit.
41	4	a	It's rather ordinary stuff.
42	9	a	Superheroes are only as good as the supervillain, so let's get these forces clashing early on and often.
43	0	a	It packs the emotional and historical power of a heady 'family gathering' celebration of African and, to use the term then in fashion, Afro-American pride.
44	3	a	Expect well-deserved Oscar nominations for both Anthony Hopkins and Helen Mirren.
45	0	a	There's a massive heart within Jack Goes Boating to be dealt with before the eyes cynically roll, and it's confounding. Ultimately, the film is uplifting in a way that I haven't experienced at a movie this year.
46	4	a	It might not be the Oscar contender it was once hailed as, but that doesn't mean it's not a solidly made film -- even a brave one, for its willingness to tackle touchy issues.
47	4	a	Valkyrie's suspense isn't of the rousing, creep-to-the-edge-of-your-seat variety. The film is cold, metallic; the tension it creates is more akin to dread.
48	3	a	Pynchon's book translates to the screen with a wandering narrative that's as muddled as it is endearing.
49	7	a	It is a story without a story, helpless and wandering, enjoyable for its parts but failing as a whole.
50	3	a	What might have occurred during the filming of Nosferatu leaves one amused but confused about how much of Shadow is a spoof and how much is based in truth.
51	3	a	Greengrass gives the new film edginess and energy, though his almost constant use of jittery hand-held cameras might exhaust some viewers.
52	1	a	"More often than not ... ""Selma"" focuses on the one thing we don't expect in a movie about Martin Luther King Jr. - his doubts - and Oyelowo comes through with a deeply felt and quite brilliant performance."
53	6	a	A modest, somber vision of the future.
54	1	a	"Here's a documentary so slick, novel, touching and outrageous that your first thought might be ""This has to be fake."
55	0	a	an adventure with some incredibly creative ways to pay tribute to Disney's original classic while realistically updating the story for a new generation
56	5	a	Foxx is an Oscar-winner thanks to his uncanny impersonation of Ray Charles in Ray, but he plays Ayers as a multitude of tics and non sequiturs. He is hampered by Susannah Grant's muddled screenplay.
57	4	a	Delivering much more than a sci-fi extravaganza for the age of terrorism, Spielberg keeps us rooting for a family facing danger from without and distress from within.
58	3	a	Killer Joe is twisted pulp, and the actors chew on it bravely, boldly, and with varying degrees of success.
59	9	a	Doesn't contain a single genuine emotion. It's just as bogus and hollow as the movie business it portrays.
60	4	a	This is a film that never really says what's it's about, and may in fact not be about much of anything other than the zeitgeist of the era. Which, if you think about it, is plenty.
61	2	a	...continually seems to evoke other sources, from Cormac McCarthy's literate savagery to any number of Westerns, particularly John Hillcoat's phenomenally bloody The Proposition.
62	4	a	"It is not a good film, but it isn't a disaster like last year's ""The Avengers,"" either."
63	3	a	a slow-burn depiction of an imminent collision course between political power and personal responsibility
64	5	a	The film wasn't preachy, but it was feminism by the book.
65	9	a	The final product is too frivolous to really dislike; it'd be like getting upset at an Air France in-flight magazine.
66	4	a	Kline has a ball, while Dano turns in a pitch-perfect performance. He never mocks his character's desires, or undersells his fears.
67	6	a	The Rover is so intentionally vague and shapeless, it doesn't leave much of an imprint other than Pattinson's odd, melancholy performance. 
68	3	a	A less inspired but mostly entertaining sequel. Superman's battle with the three Kryptonian villains is hammy but fun. Relationship with Lois Lane is promptly abandoned.
69	4	a	'Menashe' could have used a bit more fire and spirit. It's commendable that Weinstein does not overly dramatize the prime conflict, but that also dilutes the film's poignancy.
70	6	a	What should have been the romantic thriller of the year instead turns out to be one its biggest disappointments, as The Tourist fails to tap into the charisma of its star powered duo and falls flat in its recreation of the classic adventure model. 
71	5	a	Dated screwball comedy has sexual situations, profanity.
72	6	a	Though directed with machine-like precision by Barry Levinson, the screenplay by Paul Attanasio unfortunately eliminates too many key elements in Crichton's smart but convoluted story line.
73	6	a	...a disjointed, increasingly tedious effort that has little to offer even the most ardent Chucky fan.
74	9	a	The story is as straight and obvious as raw spaghetti.
75	5	a	This schlocky piece of ultra violence plays like a pop-culture pastiche without a stable thematic foundation.
76	0	a	Sorrentino's heady, vivid yet wearily melancholic musing on midlife crisis submerges you in sumptuousness until you emerge, blinking, as if from some impossibly glamorous party.
77	3	a	All four actors are excellent, but Hoffman makes the biggest impression as Jack, whose careless dreadlocks indicate he may not have washed his hair this millennium.
78	0	a	Superman II made me cheer when I was seven years old, it makes me cheer now that I'm thirty, and it'll make me cheer when I'm ninety.
79	4	a	Matt Damon is re-bourne as a compelling action figure
80	1	a	Watching something like this on the big screen is always better than seeing it on DVD. Period.
81	4	a	The lesson of this story: if enough money is involved, greed trumps morality.
82	0	a	The experience of being so absorbed in a movie and the lives of the people in it, of trusting a director and a writer and actors to take me places completely unexpected, is so rare that I savored every unexpected turn and twist.
83	4	a	It's loud. It's stunningly dumb. And it's really, really fun.
84	5	a	More of the same...only less funny.
85	9	a	How High doesn't look like a movie somebody made. It looks like a movie somebody hallucinated and put up on the screen.
86	9	a	A group of bored white suburban teens, entitled up to their eyeballs, do increasingly stupid things that we're supposed to be concerned about. I wasn't.
87	5	a	The grim, grey-hued result is about as far from contemporary drag chic as it's possible to get - appropriate for the subject matter, perhaps, but hardly the stuff of satisfying cinema.
88	3	a	opening [the videogame world] up to the entirety of the Internet, including Disney's own marketing sites, has produced a wealth of technology puns, jokes and sight gags and material ripe for parody.
89	5	a	"At his lowest, Hitch refers to an early edit of Psycho as ""stillborn."" That description also applies to this film."
90	4	a	This overstuffed and shallow film does not come close to meeting any epic aspirations.
91	4	a	Everybody loves a David and Goliath story, and this one is told almost entirely from David's point of view.
92	9	a	It's hard to imagine a film more perversely obtuse than this dark, grim exercise in cinematic sleight of hand.
93	4	a	Edgerton, Drew Daniels's cinematography and Brian McOmber's score are leading lights in Trey Edward Shults's film. There is a slight sense of unfinished business about it all that leaves you wanting more, however, 
94	4	a	Even when the movie's overplayed or undercooked, its roughhousing energy grows on you.
95	1	a	This cinematic journey into an Amazonian heart of darkness is a haunting and unforgettable experience. 
96	3	a	Taking Woodstock has the freshness of something being created, not remembered.
97	1	a	Wilson, as a man who's trying to right the course of his off-track life, turns out to be a surprisingly good fit for Allen's signature rhythms.
98	5	a	It's not a terrible film but it's also not amusing, feelgood or moving.
99	4	a	A B-grade joy as deep-tanned and sun-kissed as a Club Tropics promo.
100	0	a	Jaws retains its power to enthrall and shock at the same time.
101	4	a	On its own simple terms, Flight of the Phoenix succeeds.
102	0	a	Frances McDormand stands tall as angry, grieving mother. Rockwell and Harrelson very strong in support.
103	3	a	"Trey Edward Shults' stark, sobering, and quietly fascinating It Comes at Night is for genre fans who are in the market for something more cerebral and personal than the average ""end of the world"" story."
104	1	a	An essential difference between this and previous similar movies is that the central point of view is not that of a European or North American interloper but that of an occupant of the forest -- in this case, a feather-bedecked Amazonian shaman.
105	5	a	Should leave young audiences smiling and content even as the grownups are sobbing like they haven't since Won't You Be My Neighbor.
106	6	a	Predictable and dispiriting.
107	4	a	Iinitially promising but finally unremarkable...
108	5	a	Why are disaster movies so frequently disasters? Probably because they are disasters first and movies second.
109	4	a	It belatedly reveals itself to be a meditation on the different kinds of loneliness, presenting isolation as a form of social stage fright.
110	6	a	In my view, Smith would do well to tweak his career a bit. How nice if he'd find a small, serious movie that tests his acting chops. Can the action heroes. Scrap the charm.
111	4	a	For Ryan fans, the movie also serves as a strong star vehicle.
112	3	a	A Private War is the kind of movie that wears you down with increasing tension and toll in the effort to move and reforge your empathetic spirit.
113	2	a	The production numbers steal the show.
114	2	a	It's hard to shake the feeling that this is merely a lesser rehash of Mendes' more accomplished film American Beauty.
115	9	a	Resident Evil isn't a product of its cinematic predecessors so much as an MTV, sugar hysteria, and PlayStation cocktail.
116	8	a	It's worth remembering that the Cloverfield movies were only able to successfully disrupt conventional distribution methods because they're good. The best thing you can say about this one is that it's free with your Netflix subscription.
117	7	a	While conceptually I Origins is no more absurd than Upstream Colour, it offers a lot less to chew on, depending on its stars to supply what credibility they can.
118	5	a	This feeble attempt to revive the characters from the popular TV series Get Smart copies the show, but without the sharp humor that made it so popular.
119	3	a	The cinematography by Bojan Bazelli is thoroughly atmospheric, making a sharply incisive visual contribution to the theme of demonic powers.
120	6	a	Too awkward, disjointed and bland while lacking dramatic momentum and true insight.
121	3	a	a vibrant, creative thrill ride that is long on imagination and gleefully short on logic
122	5	a	By the time the last reel has unraveled, so has the movie, whose endless puzzles keep accumulating until the ideas that once fueled them have turned on themselves.
123	9	a	Now is not the time to venerate kings.
124	3	a	While I laughed a lot and enjoyed myself, the reason this film did not get the highest marks from me is because I walked out feeling a little unfulfilled.
125	1	a	Leaps well beyond the rather humble bonds of a mediocre cancelled TV show into the realm of amazing, adventure filmmaking.
126	5	a	This film was made very quickly by animation standards, and the haste shows.
127	4	a	The biggest revelation is that Angelina Jolie looks pretty hot when she's dolled up with big blonde hair.
128	5	a	The cast all looks and sings the part -- and Knowles sure fills out James' tight dresses -- just make sure your theater popcorn is coated with grains of salt.
129	4	a	Taking Woodstock has fine moments and an enjoyable vibe, but it never develops a coherent point of view.
130	3	a	Albert is at the heart of it all and we see her through her own prism of vulnerability, resulting in a very human story about the search for love, acceptance and understanding of the self.
131	5	a	It may not be the worst war epic ever made -- that probably would be Battlefield Earth -- but it's darn close to being an unqualified disaster of that magnitude.
132	2	a	With Matchstick Men the destination is pretty clear; it's the travel time that's most entertaining.
133	6	a	Talk about your pointless remakes.
134	9	a	It's muddled, hackneyed and torpid, and the only emotional reaction it elicits from viewers is one of tedium.
135	5	a	Someone get masterful video game director Hideo Kojima on the line and throw out the idea for Metal Gear Fat Amy
136	3	a	A film about catharsis, the kind that exists outside of movies: the slow reawakening, triggered by the compassion and like-mindedness of another, that everyone craves.
137	0	a	...offers a foreign policy that's more cogent and practical than anything we've heard during the presidential debates.
138	5	a	It's ironic that this movie is about cartoonishly dysfunctional adults, when it is the adults who got it made and contribute the only tolerable moments.
139	0	a	"Right when I begin to feel fatigued by ""coming of age"" movies, this comes out and blows me away."
140	8	a	Racially offensive quips, flagrant sexism and Tourette syndrome gags all contribute to this witless, scare-free junk.
141	3	a	A fun, tongue-in-cheek gorefest that both spoofs and celebrates the glories of B-grade exploitation vehicles.
142	6	a	Though the screenplay is based on the life of a real person, there are nonetheless moments when the basic premise seems stretched very thin, especially given Amis' fine-boned features.
143	1	a	Stretches in this film do as good a job of evoking youth as the work of Francois Truffaut.
144	9	a	"If you like movies like ""NBK"" and ""RD"" then you must see this movie. If you don't have a strong stomach and don't like violence. Stay home. Trust me on this."
145	5	a	As a breakout role for WB star Jackson, The Skulls doesn't fare as well.
146	7	a	Nobbs is so closed-off, so understated, that we're never given a chance to empathize with or understand him ... The movie is as unrealized and unexpressed as its protagonist.
147	4	a	full review in Greek
148	3	a	A satisfying thriller and welcome counter-programming for the Christmas season.
149	5	a	How far the bite-y have fallen.
150	4	a	Sharon Stone, in her first major-league role, comes on like a postfeminist Grace Kelly. She turns her haughty, slightly blank, cheerleader sexiness into something vampish and ominous -- an all-American beauty mask.
151	3	a	Spry and alive with possibility [but] also dramatically consequential... the first spy thriller in a good while to successfully marry intentions and deeds.
152	4	a	MacFarlane's aim is true when it comes to the pic's continuous meta-commentary.
153	3	a	War violence, language, nudity in mature biopic. 
154	9	a	Everyone involved in the making of Just Getting Started should be charged with war crimes. Okay, that's obviously just a joke, but my gosh, what an endurance test this movie is. 
155	6	a	This haunted house flick has all the discipline and restraint of a Spirit Halloween store. Once the suspense is gone, all that's left is the blood spatter.
156	8	a	Oh, please. Stop and smell the manure.
157	2	a	At this point, I just want to buy Romero a drink and say, 'Christ, George, what kept you?'
158	3	a	The short form looks like a genuine alternative in Jarmusch's hands because of what he does with it.
159	1	a	The first movie in a long time to leave me speechless.
160	4	a	Roth creates vivid visuals that shock and scare and in some scenes, delight. 
161	6	a	Creaky Australian WWI saga doesn't improve with age. 
162	10	a	Dismal attempt at basketball comedy
163	5	a	What's all this add up to? Not terribly much.
164	5	a	Offers food for thought, but it is made unpalatable by Lee's decision to shoot his film with what's known as a high-frame rate, imbuing it with the artificial sheen of a promotional video.
165	5	a	For every Field of Dreams there are a dozen lesser, completely incomprehensible baseball movies. This is one of them.
166	4	a	Adults may have a good time too, but this is one the middle schoolers will better enjoy with their friends than with their parents.
167	8	a	It is a loud and bloated live action mixed with animation that will appeal to the less discriminating young ones. I guess in that case it does exactly what it was supposed to, but it is impossible to even mildly recommend something like this.
168	3	a	It's practically certain to lull moviegoers into a pleasant state of dreamy bliss.
169	0	a	The rare film possessed with the courage required to shine a light into that abyss knowing full well that down is the only way out.
170	3	a	It Comes At Night will be too dark and grim for a lot a viewers, but those of you that are into such dark arts will revel in just how pulverizing and unnerving a ride it is.
171	1	a	Was there ever a guy who could play an old school movie studio mogul like John Goodman? No.
172	5	a	The atheist equivalent of a VeggieTales movie.
173	6	a	When it's over...we have to wonder why any of it mattered in the first place.
174	4	a	Its moral that even the smallest creature can make a world of difference is one to be appreciated. It is a shame, however, that it could not keep up its energetic and fun pace established within its first act. 
175	6	a	From a technical standpoint, the film is impressive. From a narrative or message-bringing standpoint, it left me wanting. And the violence....
176	5	a	What Bee Movie really lacks is a compelling hero. Seinfeld is essentially playing himself, so what we get is a stand-up comedian in a black and yellow sweater.
177	3	a	"Be sure to watch ""The Wind That Shakes The Barley"" if you watch ""Michael Collins"
178	6	a	The film is most successful when it's playing dress-up, less so when the comedy goes black, and worst off when it attempts melodrama.
179	5	a	a bit of a mess
180	7	a	A drop-dead-erotic scene a seduction dance by the bar's featured performer, Santanico Pandemonium ... is one of the two reasons to see this movie.
181	4	a	While it's undeniably good-looking and well-acted by a cast that eventually includes Rachel Weisz, what duly ensues is predictable, pretty heavy-going and morally exasperating.
182	2	a	Though not one of Hitchcock's strongest UK films, the tale is entertaining and it contains many ideas and visua motifs that would appear in later, better works.
183	3	a	The humor and the heartbreak are equally affecting and real, making for the most satisfying American teen movie in years.
184	1	a	The funniest movie of the year.
185	6	a	Meditations on identity make Rango unique, and somewhat special, in the current animated film landscape.
186	3	a	Production designer Gideon Ponte gives a terrific look to the film, with a hard, ultramodern design that lends sterility to Patrick's personal killing field.
187	4	a	The Robin Williams you love. A very entertaining movie and a showcase for the brilliant Robin Williams.
188	5	a	A frail conceit that Allen fills out with humor that's surprisingly obvious and broad...a mildly diverting fantasy, executed without much style.
189	4	a	Sadly the film's long-winded title is emblematic of a rather convoluted endeavour, albeit entertaining.
190	1	a	It is the very particular humanity of the characters involved that makes it a successful and unique work of art.
191	3	a	There's no shortage of action.
192	2	a	Fine mainstream sitcom material.
193	6	a	Once the chases kick in and the invisible jet shows up, you'll have already withstood a healthy amount of yawns for your troubles.
194	3	a	Both a delicious exercise in great acting and a richly refined comedy-drama--tangy and touching in equal measure.
195	0	a	I, Robot is a slice of sci-fi heaven with a hearty side of bewitching visual euphoria.
196	7	a	Offers up neither clearly delineated characters nor any fundamental character of its own.
197	5	a	A rote latter-day slasher film with barely anything worth recommending.
198	3	a	A perfect, perfect prank.
199	6	a	If you've got a good understanding of Christian history, you'll probably dig this flick.
200	4	a	The outcome isn't exactly in doubt, but the ride is pleasant enough along the way. Connell in particular gives a strong central performance, and a couple of the musical numbers are infectious.
201	3	a	Woody Allen's latest venture takes him into new territory and moving locations has inspired him to deliver one of his strongest premises in years.
202	5	a	When spoofs of bad singing and songwriting are the sharpest arrows in your quiver, and your politics are diluted until they hit about as hard as someone sticking their tongue out, your satire has a problem.
203	1	a	Loach tends to get a little preachy, but his skill is undeniable. His messages strike harsh and true.
204	4	a	But it's the depiction of the loneliness and resignation in the surviving few that resounds the loudest, even when Shults's now-trademark minimalism becomes a hurdle he can't overcome.
205	9	a	This movie proves that the best place to enjoy a video game is in your living room with a cordless precision controller iron-gripped in your sweaty hands.
206	5	a	A wasted opportunity: put the two leads in a movie that didn't lazily rely on its high concept to do the work, and you'd really have something to laugh about.
207	3	a	This is a good movie about music that would have been better served without the music.
208	7	a	A polemic rather than a film. Why Cronenberg thought this DeLillo novel would make a compelling film is so confounding, perhaps only derivative traders could come up with an answer. Maybe.
209	3	a	Clinical, exacting, superbly intuitive, Saint Laurent and his associates put painstaking effort into everything from the tension of a seam to the width of a lapel.
210	3	a	It's one of those unclassifiable efforts that threaten permanently to topple over the edge of ridiculousness, but somehow manage to avoid it.
211	9	a	This could be the film that snaps everyone's patience with Hollywood animations which have a Dell computer chip where their heart should be.
212	6	a	The western is weighed down by pacing issues [and]...development problems. Ultimately, the film is unable to conjure the emotions that the plot is heavily reliant upon.
213	9	a	A dreadfully dull black comedy that reckons it's infinitely more provocative and shocking than it actually is.
214	3	a	More than enough surprises to keep you intrigued, on your toes and frightened. Solidifies itself as a solid part of the series through an incredibly smart and eerily touching conclusion.
215	1	a	Pretty, deft, and tuneful but, given the top-rate talent involved, not particularly inspired.
216	4	a	The devilishness of satire is in the details, and [Paul] Weitz's script just isn't as funny or as consistently sharp as it should be.
217	6	a	Has Lady Jane gone as chaste as the PG rating on Bright Star suggests? You have no idea.
218	3	a	Taking place mostly over the course of a single day, it's a smart and languorous film that finds time to luxuriate in conversations and to create a feeling for small-town American life.
219	3	a	Why did Jane make a film like this? Even she does not know herself.
220	5	a	If, as has been reported, Graffiti Bridge is Prince's homage to the heyday of Hollywood musicals, he should have hired a director who looks at film as more than an extended music video.
221	1	a	It's refreshing to find a funny, frisky teen narrative that makes the simple pleasures of friendship as profound as True Love.
222	3	a	The most surprising - positively surprising - performance in the film comes from Jamie Dornan.
223	4	a	Mehari's drama about the landmark court case that ended child bride kidnapping in Ethiopia is hardly a sophisticated film. But that can't diminish the importance of its message.
224	4	a	With his bulked-up physique, wispy mustache, and reckless masochism, Teller turns what could have been a goombah cartoon into a real person.
225	4	a	A decent film, worth a visit to the cinema, and it comes with a lovely, wholesome footnote: the screenplay is by Ellen Brown Furman, the director's old mum.
226	1	a	This is an exquisite, timely film. It's nice to know that occasionally, even Hollywood does something right.
227	3	a	It's as mean as a snake.
228	10	a	Undeniably, this is terribly crude material, and could very well signal the end of humanity as we know it. But it's funny.
229	1	a	The director's pacing and the relaxed and smooth editing by Jay Rabinowitz make for a dreamy show.
230	2	a	Exactly what you'd expect from a movie that features a self-mutilating house elf.
231	6	a	Plodding and lacking in logic.
232	4	a	As total packaging, you can't deny that this show is handsomely wrapped.
233	2	a	This could all too easily be seen as an offensive conceit exploiting real-life sexual trauma for exaggerated screen imagery, but the film works because the performers make it feel real.
234	4	a	Like Columbus, British filmmaker Sam Mendes insists he's discovered America.
235	3	a	supremely refined
236	3	a	Jolie displays a here-to-fore untapped comic ability.
237	0	a	Ozu doesn't sentimentalize or condemn; he merely observes human nature with calm and clarity.
238	7	a	Overly sentimental hoedown in schlock.
239	3	a	A film far from perfection, but its visual smoothness and the narrative rhythm of a powerful story allows moments of true inspiration and a heartbreaking beauty. [Full review in Spanish]
240	1	a	Some may find Ozon's rigorously clever deconstruction of so many conventions a little too French for their tastes, but cineasts and worshippers of les femmes at their most fatales will find this farce wonderfully fierce.
241	3	a	A frequently dazzling display of cinematic sleight-of-hand from writer/director Christopher Nolan, The Prestige is an entertaining, handsomely produced period thriller.
242	2	a	It is the sad story of an animal whose fate is left in the hands of people--some well-meaning, some not so much--who are error-prone, unprepared for dealing with a chimpanzee, and often uncaring.
243	5	a	The kills are fun for audiences and special effects creators alike, as are many lines, but it's still the same old thing redressed to happen someplace else.
244	4	a	One man's near-emotionless trip through an event that was the high watermark for US counterculture moves along without any real sense of purpose or pace.
245	6	a	Starts off with Rose Byrne puking in Seth Rogen's face and it's all downhill from there.
246	2	a	Greatly shortened from Mr. Fierstein's long-running, Tony Award-winning play, the film version emphasizes the lovable at every turn, but the surprise is that it does this entertainingly and well.
247	3	a	Tina Fey gets her best role since playing Sarah Palin on Saturday Night Live.
248	3	a	Prepare to be pleasantly surprised by A Perfect Getaway, a compact, no frills thriller that does it's job nicely.
249	0	a	This film's overall success hangs on Cumberbatch and what is, to date, his finest performance on the big screen.
250	5	a	...for a true-to-life story involving international intrigue and immense sums of money, to say nothing of drugs and violence and beautiful women, the result is a remarkably dull movie.
251	9	a	Laughs are not just an endangered species, but totally extinct.
252	0	a	Heroically pretentious.
253	4	a	The movie positively kicks aspirations.
254	6	a	The script is far too melodramatic, and the performances ... are hamfisted and overwrought.
255	8	a	It comes as no surprise that the director blunders the material badly, if you can even call it material to begin with.
256	6	a	... more than a gift of a gorgeous film with an unforgettable ensemble cast. Through Woody and David, [Payne] opened a door to relationship redemption that anyone who sees Nebraska can walk through. 
257	4	a	Yes, it's a cheesy slasher film, but you know that going in, and this is a well-done example of the genre.
258	7	a	A ripoff of Northern Exposure.
259	5	a	Possibly the most irresponsible picture ever released by a major film studio.
260	2	a	Some of the director's finest thriller-style work in years.
261	9	a	[There's] nothing scary here except for some awful acting and lame special effects.
262	2	a	A grubby and even nasty movie in its understanding of class structure, of culture and counter-culture and the ways that teenagers can destroy one another over the subtle distinctions therein.
263	7	a	There's a fine line between funny and just plain sick; this movie goes way beyond that line.
264	0	a	Not only as one of the best Christmas movies, but THE Christmas movie.
265	5	a	... full of one cliche after another and it's extremely predictable. Overall, the problem in the movie is that it takes itself way too seriously.
266	5	a	It's an interesting idea, deserving of a more interesting treatment, but this is just dopey and patronising.
267	3	a	Snarky and sensitive in just the right measure, what initially looks like a glib exercise in adolescent mortification has the nerve to dig a little deeper. And it winds up mining a little bit of wisdom and compassion in the process.
268	3	a	The story isn't especially interesting, but the way it's performed is marvellous.
269	2	a	In these dog days, Bourne earns what passes as high praise: It doesn't suck.
270	3	a	It is not self-conscious knowingness that drives Rango but rather a quirky and sincere enthusiasm for all the strange stuff that has piled up in the filmmakers' heads over the years.
271	6	a	It loses steam and coherence about midway through, leaving us rooting for it but doomed to disappointment.
272	0	a	Goofily gorgeous, heartfelt and endlessly rewatchable, this is the true meaning of escapism - a doorway to another world, a world created to entertain eyes, heart and brain.
273	6	a	Splashy, shallow entertainment that delivers most of what its audience expects.
274	6	a	More slog than romp, The Other Boleyn Girl tells the salacious story of two hot blue bloods who ran amok and partly unclothed in the court of Henry VIII.
275	6	a	One thing's for sure-if George Romero had directed this movie, it wouldn't have taken the protagonists a full hour to determine that in order to kill a zombie you must shoot it in the head.
276	5	a	Give us more, you feel yourself groaning: if anyone can take it, it is an audience that has paid to see a film about Alfred Hitchcock.
277	3	a	A brave step into uncharted territories. The superb leading performance from Menashe Lustig elevates this beautifully observed film. Well worth your time.
278	3	a	Clever, engaging and warm, Early Man makes up in charm what it lacks in originality.
279	5	a	The characters are paper-thin, and many of the plot's contrivances are just plain silly.
280	6	a	For director Ridley Scott, Matchstick Men represents a step back in both size and results.
281	5	a	Worlds makes for one of the strangest and bleakest productions ever to market itself as summertime movie entertainment.
282	3	a	There were plenty of ways for the film to signify Liz welcoming love back into her life without the trite conclusion that has been conceived here, and it is the one drawback to an otherwise pretty fantastic picture.
283	9	a	Before long, the afterlife starts to sound pretty damn appealing.
284	0	a	Selma is worth the price of admission. The real gift of this film is reflection as well as hope that the new generations do not repeat history. [Full Review in Spanish]
285	8	a	"Rock the Kasbah"" is an extremely stilted piece of work that suffocates the talents of its actors."
286	3	a	The picture never looks fussed-over or flattened -- it breathes, as opposed to just looking merely pretty.
287	5	a	The Bourne Supremacy fizzles with its reliance upon a plethora of chase sequences to compensate for its failure to create an engrossing protagonist.
288	3	a	The film is hobbled by a naff, TV-movie aesthetic and jarringly mawkish score. Yet Moore gives us raw heartache, running the gauntlet from fear to fury to powerless frustration, before she's barely there at all.
289	9	a	A few observational gags deliver, but all the doll-humping and chicken-slaughtering will haunt you for days.
290	7	a	Tom Hanks' second feature as director is an embarrassinly naive romantic comedy, which propagates a simplistically upbeat view of American society as one big happy melting pot.
291	5	a	At its core this movie is, despite the title, pretty shallow stuff, but compared to most example of the genre it's reasonably energetic and well-made.
292	1	a	The filmmaker kept me continually off balance, my laughs having to find their way through a shower of tears all while the unyielding tension of the central mystery kept my insides twisting into tighter and tighter knots.
293	2	a	If introductory philosophy was this much fun, enrolment would go through the roof.
294	1	a	The topography of the canyons, rivers, deserts, wheat fields and forests is no more fascinating than that of the faces McCandless encounters.
295	5	a	While Miami Vice is heavy on the style and visuals of Mann's other films, almost everything else which makes his work so watchable is absent.
296	0	a	I stopped thinking about how good it all was, and started doing nothing but reacting to it - feeling a part of its grand locations, thinking urgently as the protagonists struggled, feeling at the mercy of its inventiveness, gasping at its visual delights.
297	1	a	Immensely entertaining, impeccably structured and featuring excellent performances from its entire cast, American Hustle is one of the year's absolute best films and a serious contender for every major award.
298	3	a	The Western isn't dead. It's just become more animated... literally.
299	5	a	A giant, bombastic flop of a movie.
300	3	a	Cosmopolis deconstructs language, symbols and theories to present a sprawling and dense post-GFC Heart of Darkness.
301	3	a	There is depth in this movie, and fine acting. But even more intriguing, there are questions... questions with no clear answers.
302	3	a	A bona fide Saturday night chill-fest that tries to creep you out by getting under your skin.
303	4	a	Much of the final two-thirds of the documentary can have a TV newsmagazine feel: solidly presented, but not shaped to a larger end. As self-righteousness sets in, however justified, so does a certain artistic slackness.
304	4	a	It's like a cheap, nasty dessert: completely devoid of nutrition, probably very bad for you, but kind of delicious while it briefly lasts.
305	3	a	From a daytime firefight to an emphasis on hand-to-hand combat, the picture is winningly straightforward.
306	5	a	There were two points where I thought it was over, and both would have made for better endings than eventual finale.
307	9	a	A mess. Don't try to make it make sense.
308	3	a	Somewhere in the middle of [King's] range storywise, and toward the top in Depp's performance.
309	9	a	Brolin strides around talking to the dead and destroying things, mostly the good will he garnered after surprising everyone with No Country for Old Men and W.
310	3	a	Skyfall has the feel of both a ceremonial commemoration and a franchise-rebooting celebration ...
311	4	a	Dragons, man. That's all we're really here to see, and they do not disappoint in the slightest. 
312	0	a	David O. Russell has a gift for the farce at work in American institutions, and in American Hustle he's created another instant classic.
313	9	a	I'm not saying He-Man deserved all that brilliant of a movie ... but this thing's a freaking disaster.
314	8	a	Memo to Cuba: if you're offered the lead in a sequel to Murphy's Pluto Nash, say no.
315	3	a	While not delivering what the advertisements seem to promise, is still a great couple of hours of entertainment that does not have to depend on being gross or gory to succeed. 
316	0	a	A stirring and enlightening movie about civil rights leader Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., and his crusade for equality.
317	3	a	Rating Soderbergh's back catalogue is like comparing apples and oranges and tractors, but this is in his top bracket. Welcome back, Mr Soderbergh.
318	3	a	Familiar as it is, Secret Window is fun because writer/director David Koepp is so adept at smoothing over the cut-and-paste marks with off-kilter humor and believable human behavior.
319	9	a	Second-rate soft-core porn with art-house pretentions.
320	3	a	It's a film of big themes played out on a grand scale, a story of races and generations making an effort to connect.
321	7	a	Sadly, it often comes across more like a low-budget series of gross-out sketches.
322	4	a	Easily the best videogame-to-film adaptation yet.
323	4	a	Although The Savages is a better film for not being a cloying, schmaltzy tear-jerker, that doesn't mean that it's a movie you will necessarily enjoy.
324	1	a	Shults does a masterful job of creating a sense of place, the home suffused mostly with darkness and suggestive shadows, while his ability to push a scene from normality to unbearable tension is exceptional.
325	6	a	Though humorous and quirky at times, the film is lie-laden. And while it may be fun in an empty way to watch Cage, the film loses might whenever Rockwell is off screen.
326	3	a	... what most separates McDonagh from the Coens is the way in which he constructs a rescue of his characters, at first sight imperceptible, from their violent shifts. [Full review in Spanish]
327	4	a	Charlize Theron turnsin a powerful performance that's just as mind-blowing as her makeunder in a movie that, quite frankly, doesn't back it up.
328	2	a	a vehicle perfectly tailored for Burton's peculiar eye
329	1	a	Guillermo del Toro's latest dive into the darkness is a sumptuous, beautifully constructed tale that feels both archaic and inviting.
330	4	a	Ignoring the rules of physics doesn't make a movie more entertaining; it merely makes the writing easier. If a screenplay can cheat at any time, it encourages sloppy authorship.
331	2	a	Sure, the two leads deserve better material, but there are enough laughs here to make up for a lot of creative mistakes-casting isn't one of them.
332	0	a	Carol is the rare film that couldn't just get away with being silent, but could probably also be just as engrossing completely still -- just sitting there, watching Mara and Blanchett watch each other.
333	2	a	For seeing gigantic men beat the hell out of one another and for leering at sexed-up hotties zipping around on scooters you'll be hard pressed to find any film that's its equal - until Fast Six.
334	2	a	Has just enough substance beneath the surface throw the romantic comedy some much needed freshness.
335	3	a	I've been choked up by a film here and there, but it's been a while since a film put tears in the eyes of this reviewer.
336	5	a	Barry Levinson's Man of the Year squanders a promising premise; it's ultimately overlong, underwritten and strangely unfunny.
337	4	a	A modern romantic comedy that actually works.
338	5	a	The movie anxiously, recklessly rushes through its plot toward the climax, as if it's afraid of anyone noticing its emptiness. 
339	9	a	Bottom line, it's extremely predictable, even if you didn't read the original novella.
340	6	a	This movie telegraphs its moves from the beginning, each of its laughs calculated as if an accounting firm had prepared them using a spreadsheet and an abacus.
341	3	a	This is a different take on the superhero genre with an interesting, offbeat twist.
342	6	a	A co-pilot remarks that all children should have to wear a cowbell. That's true at least for the people aboard this plane.
343	1	a	This movie is an exception to the general rule that big special effects can wreck a comedy.
344	6	a	The tears it elicits are earned. But there's an element of fantastic fate that's discordant. Foxx is playing a miracle; Downey, a lapsed believer. Both are capable of more.
345	3	a	Western myths infuse with the story of a lizard facing an existential crisis. His name? Rango.
346	3	a	This film courts that kind of lionization far less than one would expect from Eastwood at this stage, and stands out among our contemporary film fare for its humility. 
347	3	a	It's warm, sweet and funny fluff.
348	6	a	Pattinson appears to have picked the role precisely because it will send his Twilight fans screaming out of the theater
349	4	a	It benefits from Weir's talent for big-canvas moviemaking, though the result is a commendable drama rather than a great one.
350	4	a	Visually it is sometimes amazing, but it is a large troll step down from the last trilogy.
351	1	a	Murray and scribe Ramis defy all logic and turn it into a movie you'd want to watch over and over.
352	3	a	Trotting out a cast of high-caliber actors, all playing against type, Soderbergh spins a wily, joyous slice of Southern-fried outlaw adventure. 
353	6	a	It's wonderful to see that the good guys defeated the meanies.
354	6	a	You know that thin line between disturbing and morbid? The General's Daughter tramples it into dust.
355	6	a	In romantic comedy, it's all about the chemistry. Jamie Foxx and Gabrielle Union have just enough to make Breakin' All the Rules worth seeing.
356	1	a	DuVernay's film deals less in the outcome than in the immediate, and it's hardly ever sentimental or manipulative, a common trait of films that are based on true events, used to make sure you feel inspired.
357	2	a	cloudy ambiguity with a melancholy aftertaste
358	7	a	The story is as impersonal as it is labored.
359	1	a	You won't want to have a single one of the deliciously juicy twists spoiled before you see it, the pleasure of discovering ... is part of what makes the experience such a knockout.
360	3	a	It's a small, gentle film with wistful sadness peeking around its corners, and when it's over you may feel as if you want a little more, as if we're not much closer to understanding Albert than we were at the beginning.
361	2	a	In a way, Nim's life journey mirrors our own, particularly if we end up alone, no longer having much control over what happens to us.
362	5	a	While it shows Coppola has talent, it's also as aimless as her characters' self-absorbed, self-medicated, joyless lives.
363	3	a	The music, done here by a group of grunge all-stars, doesn't even attempt to sound dead-on, but remains mostly true to the raucous spirit of the time.
364	3	a	Shocking, provocative and laugh-out-loud funny.
365	5	a	Bland and conventional, despite the sex-change angle, Different for Girls is ultimately not different enough.
366	4	a	The Tourist is a mildly pleasant cinematic journey.
367	3	a	Very nicely balanced and unexpectedly moving.
368	4	a	Philip Seymour Hoffman puts his oar in with a tender, thoughtful adaption of Robert Glaudini's stage play. A little too measured to deliver an emotional punch, it's nevertheless beautifully acted and at times rather lovely.
369	3	a	As thrillers go, Supremacy is indeed supreme.
370	4	a	Theron offers a tender performance of fractured humanity, while Ricci -- in the less showy role -- also impresses.
371	3	a	Quite possibly the most bizarre and flat-out surreal effort of Tim Burton's career...
372	3	a	An epic tale of mind, body, and spirit, The Way Back looks at the other side of WWII atrocities, and marks the return of master filmmaker Peter Weir.
373	6	a	This is yet another movie based on a true story that believes the depiction of how that story unfolded is enough to sustain it.
374	4	a	"[Bryan Cranston is] the most watchable, dangerous, frangible thing in The Infiltrator, a B-standard crime thriller based on the exploits of undercover ""narc"" Robert Mazur."
375	1	a	Plays like a comic book rendition of a David Lynch film.
376	5	a	Gets things all wrong, its sarcastic humor more often than not limp and its play for drama tone-deaf and overbearing when a lighter touch might have made a greater impact.
377	0	a	The Prestige earns high praise as a terrific historical thriller, but also because it grasps the medium's links to this subject so uncannily well.
378	0	a	With very rare exceptions - sequels are not nearly as good as the original. However, leave it to the folks at Pixar to manufacture the quintessential exception to this rule.
379	7	a	An exercise in meandering self-importance.
380	5	a	Bad movie. Neat monsters.
381	6	a	Perhaps that sweet look at a happy past explains the film's lack of depth... but it is insufficient to do justice to Grahame. [Full review in Spanish]
382	3	a	A pretty darn satisfying but undemanding story about politics, sports, and men doing their jobs as best they can.
383	3	a	A cleverly written spoof-adventure that more than rises to the occasion. Not only are the jokes dead-on, but the story and characters actually work as a decent sci-fi movie, complete with superior special effects, a grisly villain and even romance.
384	6	a	Just okay. My kids enjoyed it, although my daughter said she wouldn't mind not seeing it again.
385	3	a	If you have an indie film sense of humor -- and those of you who have it know what I mean -- you'll probably enjoy this flick.
386	5	a	"The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey"" has finally arrived, not on wings of gossamer fancy but with a hairy-footed thud."
387	5	a	The whole film feels fairly self indulgent on Seth Rogen's part. It's rather dull and quite a letdown.
388	6	a	There are bound to be very few surprises in a movie that gives away its ending in the title.
389	5	a	It's a beautiful film to look at. Unfortunately for The Tourist, looks ain't everything.
390	6	a	The movie is tamer than tame in every respect, which makes it great for little kids, if not for the grownups who bring them.
391	3	a	The top priority of Bryan Singer's film is not to be a history lesson or character study but to simply be an absorbing adult suspense film.
392	9	a	Point the finger of shame at the crack staff of writers.
393	4	a	Director Rob Marshall has a sophomore flop on his hands.
394	4	a	Mr. Marsh, by allowing those closest to Nim plenty of room to explain themselves, examines the moral complexity of this story without didacticism.
395	1	a	This charmer of a film runs a little long and is heavy on the CGI dragon. The real special effect is Adams, who sings the Alan Menken and Stephen Schwartz songs with brio, complementing her vivacious performance.
396	2	a	The cutting and camera work in Sign 'O' the Times are too intrusive, and the somewhat discordant songs worked better as a magnificent hodgepodge on the album. Still, this concert movie is a feisty, engaging show.
397	3	a	More often than not, it's a film that rings true and has much to offer.
398	7	a	Take the intriguing premise of a punk-rock Western based on a graphic novel, populate it with a good cast, add striking visuals and you come up with...a real mess.
399	0	a	Hitchcock's film is distinctive, above all else, because it is the only one in his long catalogue without a scornful mask separating the obsessions from the vulnerabilities, and into the frames he pours the living essence of his timeless panache.
400	3	a	Irreverent, violent and wickedly clever.
401	6	a	It has its moments, but mostly it feels like being stuck in the backseat on a long car ride.
402	2	a	What makes this movie work is the smart script and the outstanding cast that gives these characters depth.
403	6	a	The film is entertaining and moves along at a good clip, but when you reach the anticlimactic ending, you realize that nothing really happened, and that for every cool scene there was a badly directed one.
404	2	a	Fans of both Wenders' movie and of Cuban music ... will find it expands their knowledge and love of son, Cuba's unique sound.
405	4	a	Sincere energy gives this soul-searcher something magic to find - if even along the beaten path.
406	5	a	It's let down by a disappointingly uneven plot, painfully underwritten characters and dodgy effects.
407	3	a	White usually goes beyond the surface veneer of his characters, finding a lurking humanity to those that society might easily dismiss.
408	3	a	There are plenty of laughs to be had in this.
409	6	a	It's a violent, noisy, low-brow distraction.
410	5	a	Christopher Robin is a film where the tone is too much like Eeyore and not enough like Tigger.
411	0	a	One of cinema's stunning achievements. If God ever watched a movie, he might well pick this one.
412	4	a	Cruise is, well, Cruise with an eye patch. Like the film, he isn't great but not bad either.
413	4	a	An unreal sense of happiness permeates the film. Positives shimmer beneath the surface of plot parts that ought to be a bit more negative. None of the smiles seem real.
414	0	a	Vibrant, visually exciting and emotionally resonant.
415	9	a	"You'll learn lots more if you just watch the original ""Psycho"" again."
416	5	a	If [Gere and Ryder are] not the most charmless doomed lovers of all time they come damned close.
417	4	a	Moderately amusing.
418	3	a	The sequel finds room to grow on the original film's premise by exploring not only a larger world beyond video games but also new and more complicated dimensions to the core friendship at the heart of these movies.
419	6	a	If you value your time and your relationship, don't see this on a date.
420	1	a	That the film is a worthy swan song for Richard Harris is first a surprise then an incalculable relief--and destined to be the proudest legacy of the picture: a beautifully crafted dark fable.
421	4	a	Rationalize Lecter's brand of pure, irrational evil and you take all the fun out of it.
422	3	a	Despite the weak story, Hanson commands a strong performance from Eminem and showcases both the rapper's newfound acting abilities and his musical talent.
423	3	a	While the film nowhere near matches the success of the director's earlier ventures, it nonetheless rises to the occasion in delivering a bit of social satire.
424	4	a	This kid makes Ferris Bueller look like a dangerous radical.
425	0	a	A second chance for Malick to cast away the chemical stained print and achieve the film he envisioned, and a second chance for audiences to experience a true classic on the big screen.
426	0	a	To watch Anthony Hopkins play Alfred Hitchcock is to experience an onscreen transformation that's so complete, so comprehensive, it's as if the real person has been revived. 
427	3	a	The acting throughout is exceptional, rooted in observed realism, but suggestive of more mythical agents at work through the lives of human beings.
428	2	a	Silver Linings Playbook is a fine, funny film, and one that should charm viewers who haven't been tricked by all those Oscar nominations into anticipating it as some kind of world-changing work of art for the ages.
429	8	a	The entire film is just so over-the-top, feeling more like an After School Special than a serious inner-city drama.
430	1	a	A desolate comedy-drama about fathers, sons, life's highways and missed off-ramps.
431	3	a	A little gem that is certain to touch your heart.
432	10	a	Such a torturous mess that it winds up doing something I hadn't thought possible: It renders Johnny Depp charmless.
433	9	a	"The credits list the film as being ""written and directed"" by Paul W.S. Anderson. ""Programmed by"" would be a more accurate credit."
434	0	a	A gemlike movie that's intimate and moody but never sentimental.
435	0	a	More than a great movie; it is a gathering of all the lessons of the emerging era of sound.
436	1	a	...bitter and heartbreaking, an unsentimental examination of human needfulness that allows for traces of grace amid the ashes.
437	0	a	Bitter, nerve-wracking, ugly and relentless, Revolutionary Road is Big Drama done right, a mesmerizing look at desperate lives, wrong moves and spoiled dreams that hits hard right from the beginning and never lets up.

439	3	a	The writer-director is up to his old tricks, creating an onion of an experience -- a movie within a movie within a movie, irony in each layer, poignancy that stings and whimsy that bites.
440	4	a	a cast full of talented comedians and a director who obviously doesn't mind watching his cast go way over the top in search of raucous and randy laughs
441	1	a	Safety Not Guaranteed is an excellent comedy, one with tons of heart, great characters, and tremendous performances from Aubrey Plaza and Mark Duplass.
442	4	a	An uneven psychological thriller.
443	4	a	While certainly diverting, its overly frantic attempts at humour, pointless homages to other films and lack of charm mean it falls some way short. It's not terrible but neither is it memorable.
444	1	a	Entertaining adaptation of Michael Crichton's sexual harassment thriller.
445	5	a	You long for [Williams] to break the metal mold, if only for a minute, to remind you that you are watching the best improvisational comedian of this millennium.
446	4	a	There is also something educational to be gleaned here: Snakes are not indigenous to Hawaii and they don't attack unless provoked.
447	0	a	I love this film.
448	4	a	While Depp turns his bug-eyed reptile into a charismatic character, the plot gets lost in a maze of tangents and the story has too many tasteless jokes -- like a prostate gag -- that are not kid-friendly.
449	5	a	You know your movie's in trouble when its star is outshined by a bowl of spaghetti.
450	0	a	A major cinema event of the year, a masterpiece of Italian film traditions in social/political realism and historical family epic.
451	1	a	Spectacle and human drama interweave beautifully in this epic recreation of the spirit of ancient Rome in all its pomp, splendor, and horror.
452	3	a	Profoundly surprising the viewer every step of the way, all while following a tried, tested and triumphant formula.
453	5	a	Pretty much meets egg-spectations of an absurd bird game plucked from an app and served up on the big screen.
454	3	a	Performed in Yiddish and shot in Brooklyn's Borough Park, this is a rare insight into Orthodox Jewish culture.
455	5	a	pat and condescending
456	5	a	Some kids at the screening I attended were growing restless ... and so was I.
457	6	a	Heartfelt but lightweight and inconsistent.
458	3	a	Watching this nearly four-hour film is like attending a college history seminar. That's what's good about the movie, and also what's bad about it.
459	4	a	This could have been a pretty tight little thriller if it weren't for the gaping, bleeding plot bulletholes.
460	8	a	...this isn't even a movie we can enjoy as mild escapism; it is one in which fear and frustration are provoked to intolerable levels.
461	6	a	The meandering and sloppy finale only makes it even more ironically forgettable.
462	4	a	It qualifies its thrill of victory with a very sober message: few high school athletes become NBA millionaires, many are cheated out of an education.
463	3	a	Romance comedies definitely come better than this, although perhaps not lately.
464	7	a	The screenplay was lacking, the characters not engaging, the story dragged on and no real insights on being a geisha. Paul Chambers, CNN.
465	2	a	The movie ultimately belongs to Mr. Dorff, whose villain is as frightening as any human reptile to have slithered onto the screen in quite some time.
466	9	a	One of those Deep Dark Secret movies, the dull indie Lake City combines a wholly uninteresting family mystery with a wholly unconvincing crime drama.
467	6	a	...a profoundly misguided endeavor that squanders a seemingly foolproof premise...
468	9	a	Excruciating.
469	3	a	It delivers action, comedy and intensity charged with jolts of terrifying scary fun.
470	8	a	Snakes fails for the simple reason that it is a terrible, terrible movie.
471	2	a	Is it too much? Oh, yeah. But if you like this kind of thing, too much is never enough.
472	5	a	Although it was directed by Fatal Attraction auteur Adrian Lyne, this film lacked the punch and thriller elements that made that one a hit
473	3	a	James Bond only does things you could never do, but Bourne does things you could never even think of.
474	3	a	The movie is a road trip that takes a bad turn to hell. Check it out.
475	10	a	A comedy that surpasses stupidity, and not in entertaining ways.
476	4	a	This infectiously entertaining summer movie makes you feel good. It provides hope that a fresh start is possible regardless of age. Hanks has oodles of charm, and he and Roberts have great chemistry. The real find in the acting arena is... 
477	10	a	Renaissance Fair: The Movie.
478	3	a	It's remarkably good fun. It's retro enough to be amusing in the dull bits and timeless enough to be fresh and vital today.
479	1	a	A welcome entry in the flailing neo-noir tradition.
480	1	a	A revelation.
481	4	a	Jackson seems to be going through the motions of epic fantasy filmmaking.
482	1	a	...doesn't amount to much, but wow does it have some electric performances.
483	1	a	Snake Eyes is about multiple perceptions of one major event, their relationship to each other and to the audience.
484	6	a	Some of this stuff is fun, but some of it is crushingly routine.
485	5	a	While far from the worst of its ilk, feels half-baked and dull as it plods along a kids-on-the-run journey doing nothing to separate itself from that most crowded of crowds.
486	4	a	Mixed tones can, and do, work, but a mixed bag is a problem.
487	3	a	"It's undeniable that the good-natured ""Afterschool Special"" vibe here plays to the film's corny strengths, and the dancing is impressive. So much so that it's almost impossible not to cheer during the final round."
488	4	a	[not] a bad film, merely a mismarketed one...a sad little Valentine from Mars to Venus
489	8	a	about an old couple on the verge of decrepitude deciding to make a go of their marriage because they have no other choice. Yeah, it's awful. 
490	5	a	For the most part, this is a bust of a movie, the kind that would probably have otherwise gotten dumped to theaters in January by a studio looking to cut its losses.
491	5	a	Never as clever, exciting, or romantic as it wants to be, The Tourist underwhelms on every level.
492	3	a	Anyone who has known love can attest to its ability to forever alter a charted course and Cahill's emotionally raw approach to filmmaking gets to the truth of that in a memorable way.
493	3	a	Eastwood's clearly having a ball as a gravel-throated solider man.
494	2	a	A classic children's film from the master of Japanese animation.
495	1	a	It's a beautiful, stirring, and thoughtful film, well worth seeing. 
496	9	a	So exasperating in its contradictions, so frustrating in its fakery, so deeply irritating in its pretensions, it's frankly hard to know where to begin to dissect it.
497	3	a	The next time Marting considers a script like BRINGING DOWN THE HOUSE, he should watch this and remember when he was funny.
498	5	a	The true story of racial injustice gets uninspired treatment in this well-intentioned but uninvolving film version.
499	3	a	Despite its length, it never drags.
500	5	a	Eliot is conceived as something of a blank-slate character, and [Demetri] Martin isn't engaging enough to give anything but a blank-slate performance.
501	4	a	It's a fun and relatively competent space thriller which goes some way to explain its two predecessors.
502	9	a	A baby-brained meditation on the afterlife, it's a cosmic catastrophe, the kind of New Age nonsense a schoolkid might write before realising what a crock of hooey it was and binning it.
503	6	a	The overblown action and cheapo effects become as relentless as the undead.
504	3	a	Crimson Peak is so addictively watchable and macabre, there's no doubting Del Toro's sulphurous showmanship.
505	3	a	Director Rob Bowman obviously realizes that he's working on a simple popcorn flick, yet still does everything he can to make Reign of Fire a quality popcorn flick.
506	2	a	Will obviously appeal especially to soccer-obsessed Europeans, but its consistent strain of genially eccentric British humor should endear it to audiences everywhere.
507	3	a	It's official: this is a horror series that actually won't disappoint.
508	3	a	A film that is visually compelling and highly entertaining in an in-jokey sort of way.
509	1	a	Logan Lucky is triumphant return, a crowd-pleasing heist movie that is funny, thrilling, and just so damn cool.
510	2	a	Willem Dafoe's performance in Shadow of the Vampire is so irresistible it not only breaks that cycle but turns an otherwise just adequate film into something everyone will want to take a look at.
511	5	a	The more realistic The Grey Zone pretends to be, the more its unrealistic elements stand out.
512	0	a	Terrence Malick creates a film that has all the rich density of a literary experience but is made irrefutably cinematic in its lavish, uncompromised visual detail.
513	0	a	A detective story in which a skunky marijuana fog replaces the acrid haze of gun smoke and the spill of stems and seeds is more likely than the spill of blood.
514	3	a	As bold and unyielding as The Grey Zone stands with its historical subtext, there are a few factors detracting from the powerful message.
515	3	a	A finely etched character study, with Cumberbatch on towering form. Set coordinates for the Oscars.
516	9	a	Despite a promising start, Cowgirls is one of the most boring movies of all time, a ridiculous stew of mysticism, flat satire, and whimsy.
517	5	a	A hodgepodge of comic melodrama, more panto than pathos.
518	6	a	The Marquis de Sade couldn't have been as dull a person as this film makes him out to be.
519	4	a	...an interesting, if somewhat confused, look at mental illness.
520	7	a	Dawdles and drags when it should pop; it doesn't even have the virtue of enough mindless violence to break up the tedium of all its generational bonding.
521	0	a	There are scenes here with the potential to become genuinely iconic.
522	4	a	This is less a hardball than a softball, without any curves or surprises.
523	3	a	Midnight in Paris is a terrific picture -- an appealing, bubbly, intelligent fantasy made by a director in an unusually playful mood.
524	6	a	It coasts on strangeness only so long before the novelty wears off.
525	5	a	This tepid exercise is to a good thriller what paint-by-numbers is to fine art.
526	6	a	The film can feel a bit too easy to swallow, but at least with the charm of its cast, it's never boring.
527	5	a	Hollywood, which spent most of the last century ignoring the black family, seems determined to spend most of this one showing the same black family. Over and over.
528	0	a	Still quite eerie
529	2	a	A halfhearted attempt at a happy ending just doesn't replace the good that could have been accomplished with a resolution more worthy of Matchstick's deserving characters.
530	4	a	A cannily observant but withholding film in which nothing happens, over and again.
531	4	a	The director's grip on the drama is often weakened by his penchant for creating spectacles.
532	5	a	If you're impressed by a wave of nostalgic nods to the past, at the expense of anything remotely interesting itself, this is really the film for you.
533	0	a	This classic delivers warmth all year long.
534	4	a	The film's reserve softens some of its more piquant observations about tradition and mortality.
535	5	a	Justin Haythe's disappointing screenplay is less than cinematic. Too much of the dialogue is on-the-nose, and more akin to theatre than real life. Far too much is said. The brilliance of Yates's novel lay in the amount that he left unsaid.
536	0	a	The film still represents the cutting edge of dark science fiction.
537	1	a	This wonderful sequel leaves America in a pretty good place: Weed is practically legal, girls are people too, and Seth Rogen is the new Tom Hanks. Get used to it.
538	9	a	A dull film with unsympathetic characters brought together by a gimmicky premise that's handled with no imagination and a pristine fraudulence of emotion.
539	9	a	Engrossing
540	1	a	[Murray] is effortlessly superb.
541	6	a	The narrative gets severely bogged down in the boring minutia of spy work, showcasing the smallest details of Gunter's investigations, all the while muddling up the plot and any sense of character development.
542	4	a	Breezy, romantic Hitchcock; an underrated gem.
543	4	a	The brisk, engaging story has a strong undercurrent of Blade Runner-esque, the animation is utterly gorgeous.
544	3	a	The film suffers at times from biopic-itis -- the narrative unfolds with the requisite heartbreak carefully apportioned -- but it's always eye-catching.
545	4	a	The Bridges of Madison County is as good as it is because of its performances. It's as bad as it is because of its source.
546	4	a	THE Hobbit occupies that same awkward spot in popular cinema as the Twilight movies in terms of balancing good cinema against fan-service.
547	4	a	Another win, but only just.
548	8	a	Like a wilted bridal bouquet...a movie that arrives dead on the vine and then asks you to spend eighty minutes watching it wither.
549	5	a	Would you sell your body for a night, to the tune of a million dollars? What makes for five minutes of interesting conversation, alas, does not make for an interesting two-hour movie. [Blu-ray]
550	8	a	It has, in the form of Audrey Hepburn and Alan Arkin, two of the very best performances in the genre's history.
551	7	a	"I Don't Know How She Does It"" seems stuck in the past."
552	4	a	Perhaps the greatest testament to Eastwood's directorial skill is that such an unattractive, brutish game could serve as an uplifting symbol of communal harmony and renewed national spirit.
553	1	a	Above all, Valentino is a celebration of beauty and love, and the ways in which one begets the other.
554	2	a	Loach's film is an enormously sympathetic conflation of two pet themes: the effect of grinding poverty on the ever weakening working class and his nation's all-too vulnerable youth.
555	1	a	We Have a Pope takes its shots at the institution of the Catholic Church, but this is by no means a scathing satire. It's more of a character study, insightful and nuanced, about a man grappling with a profound sense of inadequacy, questioning himself.
556	5	a	It's never entirely clear why its three unrelated stories are being told in the first place.
557	2	a	No other performance this year slapped a smile on my face so quickly. If only director Taylor hadn't constructed a movie as mercurial as its subject. For all the talk here about grooves, the movie has a tough time finding one.
558	4	a	When it comes to the imagination scale, Harry Potter has everything it needs. But what does it all really amount to in the end? Not much of a payoff, I'm afraid.
559	4	a	Quale's witty kills are such a blast you may wish they hadn't wrapped the series up so neatly.
560	7	a	"If this movie had a theme song it would be, ""The Lazy Song"" by Bruno Mars because its doing nothing at all."
561	3	a	Safety Not Guaranteed succeeds on its own merits by adapting our expectations towards more basic ideas of human nature rather than the fantastical sci-fi notions of the mind.
562	4	a	It doesn't feel like the intrigue generates much suspense, as warring elements and uneven emotions prevent the film from standing out as an innovative fantasy.
563	6	a	A few actors make momentary impressions, yet most are kept in the shadows, as hard to make out as this movie's ultimate intentions.
564	0	a	The work of a passionate, intelligent and audacious artist who knows exactly what he wants to say and how he wants to say it.
565	4	a	It's decent mass consumption entertainment, but there's not much in the way of meat.
566	2	a	The subject matter is a little too easy to overdo for that, but it is pretty good, thanks to a pair of fine performances from its leads and a director who understands understatement. And sometimes those can be as rare to find as a genuine musical prodigy.
567	3	a	A frightening, tangled tapestry of youth as its worst.
568	8	a	Seems entirely prefabricated...absurdly contrived and overwrought in a whole variety of bad ways.
569	3	a	Being swindled has never been this much fun.
570	4	a	Poor Dug barely possesses a personality, or a dramatic arc -- so why isn't Goona the lead character?...Kids, of course, will be mesmerized by the delightfully crude stop-motion and the Saturday morning cartoon high jinks.
571	6	a	It's too palatable. It maintains a tone of light seriousness, and it depends on the caper for too much of its entertainment value.
572	4	a	It's the funniest thriller of the year, although I'm not sure if everything we laugh at is supposed to be amusing.
573	3	a	This Ridley Scott film, his best in years, re-envisions ancient Rome for the aughts and makes it safe to go back in the Colosseum.
574	4	a	It has trouble in achieving liftoff. But, except for Romano, the cast is so naturally funny that it's a hard movie to resist.
575	3	a	Soderbergh is perhaps Hollywood's finest technician, and it's a pleasure to watch him tour his Vegas act through Appalachia.
576	5	a	Singer makes a noble and romantic fist of this terrific story but it feels spookily like a well-oiled Hollywood entertainment rather than a sensational chapter of history.
577	9	a	If giggling hillbillies fuel your nightmares, then there's a chance you'll be rendered sleepless by this inept, wannabe horror flick.
578	4	a	The tone in Killer Joe feels so expertly and delicately crafted that we only laugh at the film's absurd scenarios if and when the filmmaker permits it so.
579	1	a	Tupac: Resurrection is surprisingly direct...
580	3	a	A vestige of hope for your inner geek yearning to rebel.
581	4	a	A movie that cares much more for poetic choreography in explosive gunfights than gaping lapses of logic in a flimsy crime narrative.
582	2	a	A curiosity, you might say.
583	6	a	The story is convoluted, and makes no sense whatsoever.
584	0	a	Howard is not above pushing buttons of his own and milking the big moments. But they are indeed big moments, and the manipulation is not intrusive. He has made a can-do movie for our can't-do age.
585	10	a	This could be one of the most awful movies of the year. Then, it gets worse.
586	5	a	I wish the film was more focused on the love story between Vanessa Redgrave and Franco Nero. Instead, we are made to sit through a foreground love story with zero chemistry.
587	1	a	A poignant drama that will leave you yearning for the kind of transformation that takes place near the end.
588	4	a	The Scary Movie franchise is running out of steam pretty fast. They're still funny, and the gags still work. But there's only so far you can go with it.
589	9	a	Jonah Kex, Jonah Wrex, Jonah Hax, Jonah Kax, Jonah Thix, Jonah Crox, Jonah Sux.
590	5	a	The other mystery is unspoken and unintentional: What is it about Margo that causes such a hullabaloo?
591	4	a	This is an energetic, fun, almost enchanting thriller with genuine moments of tension and a good few thrills too.
592	6	a	The film's aesthetic is marked by off-tempo editing and a tone that vacillates between grim and coy, and though it's occasionally visually evocative, it's also unmistakably over-calculated.
593	3	a	Mann knows how to make a movie move, and there are sequences in Miami Vice, such as that initial nightclub rumble, that are like swirling fantasias.
594	3	a	Stallone encourages a pure bath of brutality, sans winks. It's up to the viewer to decide if this is all disgusting overkill or the cinematic equivalent of a firm erection.
595	3	a	Annette Bening lights up the screen in this stunning portrait of a fading star.
596	5	a	Good cast can't save stereotype-laden comedy.
597	3	a	Funny, sexy and stylish as hell, Russell's Scorsese homage lacks the zip of Marty's greatest work, but makes up for it with hilarious dialogue and a killer ensemble on top form.
598	4	a	Funny, passionate and honest.
599	2	a	...fast paced, full of colorful, fanciful imagery and high good humor.
600	3	a	A charming, fanciful and whimsical tale of love, bondage and the quest for escape from the awful fate of being turned into nuggets.
601	6	a	A carjacking leads to violence, revenge and antiheroes impossible to root for in Waist Deep, an urban gangster crime-thriller.
602	1	a	Identity is one of those rare thrillers where the cops aren't fools, villains don't turn stupid at crucial moments, and career assassins seldom miss targets.
603	5	a	Thanks to heavy-handed treatment, this true story ultimately feels like a work of mannered fiction.
604	6	a	Whatever we might think of its broader implications, in the end, The Angry Birds Movie is basically a franchise extender that follows a predictable formula.
605	3	a	By keeping the plot relatively simple, Mendes has given himself room to expand the characters, lend them a certain depth and just have a bit of fun.
606	3	a	If you're going to like it, you already know it.
607	4	a	Terrific acting but the film at large suffers from pacing problems, perhaps deciding midstream what it wanted to be about.
608	3	a	The film dares its viewers to consider that--for a couple of hours, at least--even when a thing seems too good to be true, it might not be.
609	2	a	The comedy in the film works very well. The romance isn't quite as convincing, but good acting and romantic chemistry prevail.
610	3	a	As sunny and implausible as an old-timer's anecdote, with a few hints at topicality that don't detract from its insouciance. It's fun for fun's sake. 
611	6	a	Lee might be a pioneer, but what good is that when he leaves his story behind?
612	2	a	With dry, understated wit and an attitude that is giddy without being sophomoric, Galaxy Quest succeeds in being one of the more enjoyable comedies of the season.
613	0	a	A masterpiece.
614	5	a	The Frontier is a blast from the past as far as suspenseful thrillers go, but it's not an entirely invigorating one.
615	5	a	With little visible talent and no energy, Colin Hanks is in bad need of major acting lessons and maybe a little coffee.
616	3	a	Don't fight the Law, and dig into this adorable jaunt.
617	3	a	...a boisterous, lively, and absurd romantic comedy, not even remotely concerned with properly documenting the period or offering a nuanced depiction of the monumental day. 
618	3	a	Changed ending aside, Fincher's take is as faithful as it is fearless. And Mara rocks.
619	6	a	Radio is just another typical offering of formulaic family fare that screams virtuosity when in reality it whispers sappy platitudes...drippy and predictably soupy
620	5	a	We love stories of real-life heroics and grace under lethal pressure. But we need them to be more than the sum of their stirring intentions.
621	6	a	The Passion of the Christ plays like a blend of a political-theology lesson and a snuff film.
622	0	a	Like The Crying Game, Pulp Fiction and other films that shift paradigms in mid-stream, there's more happening than meets the eye....Stark and spare, it's often a gasp-inducing, armrest-clutching experience.
623	5	a	This very typical romantic comedy flubs details repeatedly in order to reach the moments that it wants to reach.
624	2	a	The Artist is a slight confection, really, but it's so delicious and knowing that it may well end up on any number of cineastes' desert-island lists. It's certainly on mine.
625	2	a	At its heart it's mostly a spooky kids' film by numbers, but the film has a charm, the cast appear to be having fun and Owen Vaccaro is an engaging young lead. 
626	1	a	...Embrace of the Serpent is meditative and interesting, and not a moment in the film feels unoriginal.
627	4	a	Jackie Chan's latest comedy-adventure is an amusing genre-blender, mixing Chan's Hong Kong action with Hollywood's cowboy tradition.
628	2	a	An honest film, full of affection and one that doesn't try to hide the fact that it's all about showing the emotions of it's characters. [Full review in Spanish]
629	5	a	But worse than any of this, for the first time in three films this whole Death-is-out-to-get-you scenario is, of all things, boring.
630	3	a	Robots, explosions, gunplay, action, Will Smith...hmmm, it must be July.
631	4	a	Inherent Vice is a sun-glared, neon-limned muddle of noir plotline and potheaded jokery that not only doesn't make sense, but actually seems to try hard not to.
632	4	a	For families with small children, this one's honey in the bank.
633	5	a	The writer-producer-director of American Dreamz makes nearly every mistake in the satirical book. His targets are either too easy or too dated. He's inconsistent in his attitudes toward them. His stereotypes are stale.
634	6	a	"Let me pull out my crystal ball: ""Hereafter"" is intriguing in a lot of ways, but not a ""Million Dollar Baby."" "
635	4	a	It is one of those nicely-made efforts where every element sits perfectly in place, but the director is too tentative to shift them around too much. So they just sit there. The choice is yours: enjoy the stillness, or move on.
636	6	a	It fumbles a bit by prioritizing the goofy antics of its white cast over what turns out to be a smart depiction of non-Western life.
637	5	a	It's just a shame that someone wasted their fluids creating a number of the people responsible for this absolute mess.
638	3	a	This is certainly a bleak story but it's also a rich and very nuanced one.
639	1	a	A delirious guilty pleasure, Sneakers is about as probable as me parting the Red Sea -- and just as fun.
640	2	a	Crowd-pleasing and rousing, the movie's winning third final act will definitely render the picture as solid contender in awards season.
641	5	a	Yet there's still enough to hold the attention - the actual Apollo equipment has the ring of authenticity - and it's worth taking the trip just to gawp at the sheer beauty of the programmer's art.
642	4	a	Amusing, but somewhat toothless. 
643	3	a	Belief may be in question for much of the movie -- only for the perturbed pooch -- but fortunately, enjoyment is never a problem.
644	3	a	A screenwriter's butterfly flaps its wings and a chain of events is set into motion, resulting in the latest cinematic ensemble tale of connectivity and yearning. This one's good, though.
645	4	a	Mad props to Peter Zuccarini, who headed the team of ocean-bound photographers and captured some remarkably vivid footage, and also to the actors, who spend plenty of time looking cool, calm and collected swimming with the predatory fishes.
646	9	a	Predictably awful fourth installment.
647	3	a	The king of the road is Zahn, expertly steering his path between ironic goofball and real scared dude.
648	4	a	You'd think the Fast And The Furious franchise would've run out of gas by now. Think again.
649	4	a	overlong...but beautifully photographed...and expertly acted
650	6	a	Wonderland skips lightly along the sewers of human depravity as if the trip alone was worth the telling.
651	9	a	Identity Thief is torture porn. We've been using that term wrong for years.
652	1	a	Excitingly original indie vision.
653	4	a	Pairing Tom Hanks with Julia Roberts gives rise to great expectations - which are dashed in this schmaltzy, mediocre romantic comedy.
654	3	a	Pixar masterpieces aside, it's been quite a while since Disney cranked out an animated movie worthy of its fairy-dust-sprinkled castle logo.
655	4	a	Predictable though the film is, Vanessa Redgrave does nearly mystical work and the film in general has enough humor to make the trip worthwhile.
656	8	a	Beneath the flashy surface it doesn't have a shred of intelligence, and it sinks in a sea of lame writing and laughable performances.
657	2	a	The film unspools as an admittedly bizarre blending of an animated adventure film for kids and a meta-comedy about a character who must morph from being a fictitious hero to being a real one.
658	4	a	The story falls apart, while Gondry ratchets up the silly action so far over the top the structure of the film can't support it.
659	4	a	A classic case of a star's charisma overcoming a screenplay's shortcomings.
660	1	a	There's no question that the tale is timeless no matter where or when the story is set, and you cannot deny that the spectacular cinematography makes Black Orpheus a thrill to see, but it's the score that really makes the movie resonate.
661	6	a	With vocal inflections and a caring glance, McDormand rescues the mother-son dynamic that twists through Canyon like the famed Mulholland Drive.
662	5	a	A tossed bouquet full of dead flowers and bad jokes that belongs in the nearest trash receptacle.
663	2	a	Hysterically, the whole thing makes perfectly imperfect sense.
664	5	a	The Cloverfield Paradox, despite a strong opening and a satisfactorily-downbeat ending, has little of real interest going on for the bulk of its running time.
665	0	a	A tough, sober, lived-in look at the gruntwork of activism.
666	4	a	The way-over-the-top campiness is so completely ridiculous, it's impossible to take anything in the film seriously. And trust me, that's not a bad thing.
667	6	a	Director John Curran's Chappaquiddick is a decent Cliff's Notes version of events, though it's hard not see sanitization masquerading as ambiguity.
668	5	a	What a boring movie.
669	3	a	A potent psychological thriller bolstered by strong performances and an offbeat sense of humor.
670	4	a	By giving us the feeling of experiencing Jesus' thoughts, and by making us privy to his prayers, The Passion draws us toward Christ's full humanity like no film before.
671	7	a	Tim Story -- who, based on his previous work in the small-scale Barbershop and the painfully poor Taxi, was clearly the wrong man for this job.
672	0	a	Carried by Renee Zellweger whose particular forte is unquestioned honesty, directness and guilelessness, supported by no less than Morgan Freeman in a semi-comedic turn and Chris Rock in a semi-serious turn, it's a rare entertainment.
673	4	a	For the uninitiated, it's enjoyable enough to see what the fuss is all about even if it will likely lead you to Netflix or other binge-viewing options for a marathon session afterwards.
674	6	a	'CQ may one day be fondly remembered as Roman Coppola's brief pretentious period before going on to other films that actually tell a story worth caring about
675	3	a	Fascinating and exquisitely executed.
676	6	a	...a cocky and contrived contraption which gingerly dances around its Medieval-themed mediocrity...[an] overwrought costume drama
677	3	a	The movie's appeal lies largely in its capacity for surprise, riffing off tired characters and pooped genres to produce, intermittently at least, a fresh new tone. Call it junkie humour.
678	1	a	Even those who know the torturous story by heart will be impressed by the intense focus, attention to detail and fidelity to the original material that director David Fincher brings this jagged little tale.
679	3	a	While urgency is less of a priority this time out, the helmer still puts together an irresistible collection of characters and personal issues.
680	1	a	It has a visual syntax so eloquent -- its fields of gold cause its quiet characters to stand out like mythic figures -- it would play powerfully as a silent film. 
681	5	a	A movie that's every bit as oversimplified and obvious as its title.
682	4	a	Sitting in the theater, my affection was definitely on-again, off-again at best. But in the end, the good times, which were fantastic, won me over.
683	6	a	Black Snake Moan is an odd little number. It tries to be a lot of things at different times, but isn't particularly successful in any genre.
684	4	a	Fairly dreary sci-fi of the oozing monster stripe with a strong lead.
685	4	a	More valuable as historical than artistic work, George Stevens' reverential Broadway-to-Hollywood transfer is marred by the weak lead performance from Millie Perkins. 
686	4	a	How sorry can you feel for rich, unadventurous Americans in a major funk?
687	1	a	"Like the experiment itself, ""Project Nim"" morphs from something inspiring and often humorous to a pointed and disturbing portrait of arrogance run amok. Greed and glory end up overriding decency and altruism, and it's heartbreaking to watch."
688	2	a	It's beautiful to look at, the acting is superb and it has its poignant moments.
689	6	a	Your mileage may vary depending on your enthusiasm for his smirking frat-boy comedy.
690	3	a	An uncommonly exciting and satisfying post-apocalyptic popcorn flick.
691	3	a	Hereafter, made in the ghostly image of the concept it explores, lingers after it's gone.
692	2	a	If Hollywood can make the rest of the summer as brainlessly fun as this then maybe people will start going back to the multiplex.
693	1	a	Nicole. Beharie. Remember the name, for if her stunning lead turn is any indication, huge things are in the future.
694	3	a	See the movie, and take the time to think, think, think with your loved ones.
695	1	a	One of those rare films that really deserved its commercial success and its place among the best films of all times.
696	1	a	First Reformed hums disquietingly along at Schrader's own clockwork pace which, like Hawke's mesmerizing performance, is austere, stoic, and ultimately self-destructive. It's a glorious piece of filmmaking...
697	7	a	A programmatic wash, suitable for the bottom half of a double bill, perhaps, if only we had such things anymore.
698	4	a	McGregor and Connelly are good as dad and mum, Hannah Nordberg and Dakota Fanning even better as, at different ages, Merry.
699	3	a	The Fight Club is an awesome man flick. Sorry girlies.
700	5	a	Not quite the second coming of Boogie Nights.
701	2	a	The director tries to give another meaning to the story by placing it in a different context. Nostalgic, fun, and yes, it still has that punk essence that permeated the first film. [Full review in Spanish]
702	5	a	It leaves you feeling voyeuristically sullied; scrubbing the blood out of your mental carpet, privy to something simultaneously indulgent and inconsequential.
703	3	a	A nice change of pace for Soderbergh, who, for the first time in a long time, seems genuinely interested in providing an entertaining ride.
704	7	a	The filmmakers are playing to the Big Boys in New York and L.A. To that end, they mock the kind of folks they don't understand, ones they figure the power-lunchers don't care to understand, either.
705	9	a	Goldies Hawn is irrestible in this funny movie. But the treatment of Arabs is groanable and cliched.
706	3	a	Give 'Max Payne' the modest credit it deserves. It's a gloriously dumb, over-the-top slice of convoluted pulp fiction, and far more entertaining than I would have expected.
707	4	a	"What makes ""The Rover"" more watchable than the average self-conscious genre exercise is Pearce, who exudes such weary authority and palpable vulnerability that he's sympathetic even in the film's most brutalizing moments."
708	4	a	It's not the usual strong role Spencer Tracy is noted for.
709	4	a	A young man with plenty of advantages renounces the modern world, wounds his family deeply and is acclaimed a sort of saint.
710	5	a	The Last Witch Hunter might be the worst video game adaptation not actually based on a video game
711	3	a	A gorgeous, lavish Gothic thriller which is part Hammer horror, part classic Roger Corman and, in the end, absolutely Guillermo del Toro.
712	1	a	This is a movie well worth your time and attention.
713	4	a	[The Nolan brothers] have collaborated on a script that is sometimes on target, but hopelessly hamstrung by a wobbly second half for which its grand finale cannot compensate.
714	4	a	Not quite good enough to jump out of the pack of Asian swordplay movies but is too well crafted to sink into utter anonymity.
715	4	a	Marshmallow nation, you may now exhale: Rob Thomas did ya right.
716	2	a	Brazilian drama about a misogynistic slave owner and those suffering under his control.
717	4	a	Disappointing to say the least, but at least it doesn't have Richard Pryor this time as its star.
718	0	a	A wild riot of color, music, passion, action, mystery, pure old-fashioned thrills and even dancing. A new classic of its genre.
719	3	a	Manages to be funny and touching without ever resorting to schmaltz.
720	6	a	A pleasant but uncompelling historical curio.
721	6	a	Its creaky, all-consuming insistence on its characters' normalcy entombs everything interesting about them in contrived schlock and transparent gloss-over techniques.
722	4	a	This taut thriller is sharply directed by John Dahl and benefits from fine, low-key performances by Walker, Sobieski and Zahn.
723	6	a	...ultimately doesn't fare as well as its mediocre predecessor...
724	1	a	"Exuberant and pitiless, profane yet eloquent, flush with the ability to create laughter out of unspeakable situations, ""Trainspotting"" is a drop-dead look at a dead-end lifestyle that has all the strength of its considerable contradictions."
725	6	a	Ermey again easily steals the show as the redneck 'sheriff' from hell.
726	2	a	A raunchy blast that's as smart as it is dumb.
727	6	a	Just wondering, but if these sisters are indeed capable of doing it for themselves as the film insists, why can't at least one of them do it without a man?
728	4	a	...a career best performance from Matthew McConaughey as a cooly creepy sadist with a gentleman's veneer, yet this dark comedy seems all rather pointless, a hundred minute build up to a single punch line. The Coen brothers did this better years ago...
729	0	a	Imaginative fantasy pits science against magic.
730	3	a	What's cool about Paper Towns is that even though she's seen through the eyes of a teenage boy, it does allow the cool girl to make choices for herself. But what's coolest is the friendship between three high school boys.
731	4	a	I kept imagining the Zucker brothers doing this. Could there be a sillier premise for a movie than snakes on crack?
732	4	a	Not quite as much fun as the from-nowhere original, but still, y'know, fackin' shocking.
733	7	a	I hate to keep harping on Meg Ryan, but seriously, Meg Ryan, when are you going to be in a good movie?
734	2	a	Along with its share of cheap comedy, it delivers a decent love story, perceptive comment on sexuality and relationships, and a breakout performance by Josh Hartnett.
735	4	a	It's good-spirited, and there are enough colorful characters to please its intended audience. Best of all is an Earth-built robot on wheels named Rover, who thinks it's a dog. He'll be a hit. If only the main characters were as interesting.
736	3	a	In describing the conflict of a woman who has it all without enjoying it all, Pearson's book had teeth. McKenna's screenplay has only a smile. But is it ever good to laugh.
737	6	a	A faded memory of the series' superior former self.
738	4	a	Wait... an all-star voice cast for a computer-animated story we've never heard of before, and it's watchable, too?
739	4	a	With its campy acting and absurd plot flavorings, the film feels like a cult-classic B-movie with state-of-the-art production values.
740	4	a	Spoilt, rich, posh, vacuous and fame-obsessed - who better to play Edie Sedgwick? If she's acting or not, Miller is brilliant. Just a shame the film is so shallow too.
741	5	a	The care and attention Ewan McGregor has given the film is admirable and he deserves credit for giving it his all, but this is a story better read than watched.
742	0	a	Greig Fraser's cool cinematography offsets the heat in Campion's ecstatically literate screenplay, which quotes Keats' handiwork all the way through the end credits. It sounds like music.
743	1	a	The best movie about cosmic jet lag not directed by Wim Wenders.
744	4	a	Gladiator is an old-fashioned sword-and-sandal tale with graphic violence and a slick gloss of sentimentality. It almost works.
745	5	a	The more realistic everything looked, the faker everything became. I'm glad Ang Lee tried, but I hope he decides against this in the future.
746	4	a	Director Alvart knows how to shoot chilly and unwelcoming, bleaching his movie with a grey-blue finish.
747	5	a	Lee and Schamus make history blandly palatable; in the process, they rob the times and the people they're portraying of their complications.
748	4	a	"All in all, ""Entrapment"" is a cute/clever, rather TV-esq picture that could have used just a little more heart."
749	9	a	About as dull and unoriginal as the title suggests.
750	3	a	It is rare for me to use a term like 'magical' to describe a film, but this movie deserves it.
751	3	a	Somehow Hoffman manages to create a man of iron resolve, who nevertheless carries the vulnerability of knowing that he has failed before. That's what makes the whole film absorbing and the final scenes so unbearably tense.
752	4	a	A first-rate thriller before it crashes and burns in the final act...The solution to the mystery is a real groaner and a politically correct cop out.
753	2	a	Jennifer Westfeldt continues to forge a strong reputation as a writer of humanist romance.
754	4	a	Fanboys does have a heart buried under all that dandruff and sexual frustration.
755	0	a	A poignant drama bringing us into the lives of Anne Frank, whose diary inspired millions seeking to understand why such a sweet, innocent child could be murdered in the Holocaust.
756	3	a	Likely to appeal to grown-ups of all ages--while putting the fear of God into kids--it's a perfect antidote to standard festive fare and evidence of the rich and varied possibilities of stop-motion animation. In a word, wonderful.
757	7	a	Everybody is so good and decent that it's hard to tell where the generals leave off and the gods start.
758	6	a	Though Williams can still make us laugh, Man of the Year doesn't deserve your vote.
759	3	a	Precisely because it's less emotionally coercive than Kore-eda's last couple of pictures, it's even more moving: rather than lunging full-bore for the solar plexus, the truths it's telling creep up on you.
760	2	a	A comedy that starts with suicide and then goes for the love story isn't for everyone, but there is an audience for this little independent film and you know who you are.
761	2	a	Energetic low-budget vampire nonsense from Robert Rodriguez and Quentin Tarantino.
762	1	a	This is a very entertaining picture.
763	0	a	Bountiful in human spirit ... and martial arts action, House of Flying Daggers is like no other film. Except for Hero, which was like no other before it. 
764	6	a	...the inane dialogue suggests each of the actors is suffering from a major case of the bends.
765	3	a	Builds an incredible amount of tension, then releases it with some startling violent encounters.
766	3	a	It's fairly solid fun without breaking any new ground.
767	6	a	The performances are all good. However, the film experiences one coincidence after the other, manipulating its audiences rather heavy-handedly.
768	5	a	It's a bummer when the audience is smarter than the protagonist.
769	3	a	It's probably Payne's most poetic work yet, a quiet, subtle study of the highs and lows of family life.
770	6	a	It's all completely over-the-top and loaded with cheese, and the mix of comedy, arch melodrama, sweeping CGI vistas and plentiful if improbable action doesn't quite gel.
771	4	a	If Fink lacks cumulative punch, its fighting power is a technical knockout.
772	7	a	A long, slow journey to nowhere.
773	5	a	...even less of a story than the videogame on which it is based...
774	3	a	If you want something to engage the mind as well as set the blood boiling then it is an unexpected pleasure.
775	5	a	Repeats itself and strains for laughs where the original giddily stumbled through them.
776	5	a	The movie is scaled too big visually and too small emotionally.
777	7	a	Stallone is a terrible action director. Sequences are visually incoherent, chopped-up, sloppy, vague. You'd think that in all the years he's spent in this racket he would've learned how to cobble together stuff like this.
778	3	a	A feast for the eyes and ears.
779	3	a	Enchanted offers us five-stars worth of Amy Adams in four-stars worth of movie. That's not a bad average.
780	1	a	Paper Towns is particularly good at pinpointing that certain point in teenage male friendships where the guys are getting older, but they still sometimes resort to silly voices and goofy humor when the girls aren't around.
781	0	a	Beautifully subtle suspense with a sprinkle of black humor.
782	9	a	Could've spared me the introduction
783	5	a	A few laughs.
784	2	a	It's simplistic to a fault and the humour is only slightly racier than a typical Saturday morning cartoon, but it does all of those things with effort and conviction.
785	5	a	A film that feels like a Europeanized compendium of just about every indie alt-action movie cliche of the past decade.
786	3	a	There's a lot of fun waiting at We Bought a Zoo, but it's the feelings that run through every scene that'll make you glad you came.
787	3	a	The jauntier vibe makes for easier viewing between the big high-speed car set pieces, which are every bit as big, loud, and crazily over-the-top preposterous as one would expect and hope.
788	5	a	It's a bore, really -- a pedestrian movie about a remarkable subject.
789	2	a	"Bill Murray keeps ""Lost in Translation"" entertaining and does a fine job of emoting the exhaustion and frustration of being so far from home and helpless..."
790	9	a	"When it comes to wisdom about marriage - well, as Henny Youngman might have said, ""Take this movie. Please."
791	9	a	A monumentally naff film.
792	1	a	...an elegy for an American way of life that may make liberals side with the old El Paso Sheriff who bemoans today's youth with their drugs and green hair. It's a Texan lament not heard since The Last Picture Show.
793	4	a	Sienna Miller, with her glossed and dimpled party-girl smile, looks so much like the actual Edie Sedgwick that you may think, at moments, that you're seeing the real thing. That spooky look-alike allure does a lot for the movie.
794	6	a	Hard-core fans of the series with enjoy it but others should steer away from this over-the-top action flick.
795	4	a	Jackson is key to keeping Snakes on a Plane from slithering into complete preposterousness.
796	6	a	"Just as Trey Edward Shults withholds the ""it"" of the title, he never attempts to justify the escalating paranoia of his characters."
797	0	a	Sometimes a movie gets you so bad that you need to tell people how excited you are about it.
798	9	a	It's the film equivalent of having a gun put to your head by someone who is intent on getting you to understand that women are incomplete if they're not mothers.
799	3	a	In a city that continually hides its social problems among the shadows, it's inevitable that the surest light to reveal them would come from a muzzle flash.
800	1	a	Mostly fun, somewhat enchanting, and at a few turns -- surprisingly spooky.
801	5	a	Phony choppers and a startling resemblance to Jon Voight aren't enough to transform Theron into Wuornos, and I didn't buy either the performance or the character for a second.
802	1	a	A riveting and emotional historical piece that bolsters one of the best performances of the year by Benedict Cumberbatch.
803	7	a	This isn't necessarily a contender for worst movie of the year, but good heavens--how can you make a movie about a plane crash so boring?
804	4	a	Its sole purpose appears to be to confuse, to muddle and to blow our minds.
805	5	a	Only the car chase--the best in years--is not confusing.
806	3	a	highly entertaining with many great set pieces.
807	0	a	When it comes to this kind of thriller, no movie has been able to top Jaws, although many have tried. And, as the years go by, it seems increasingly unlikely that anything will come close.
808	5	a	Unapologetically stupid. Proudly stupid. Aggressively stupid.
809	6	a	"An overlong gay coming-of-age tease, ""Stealing Beauty,"" without Liv Tyler, ""American Pie"" with less...baking. "
810	9	a	I sat through the whole two hours, so you don't have to.
811	4	a	Bandslam belongs to Connell. He has the unruly 'fro and endearing shamblingness of a young Daniel Stern, and he ably brings to life that rarest of cinematic qualities: decency.
812	3	a	The film is funny, silly in the best sense and full of deadpan puns, malapropisms and wordplay.
813	3	a	Gorris' film is handsome and well-acted.
814	0	a	"A documentary detailing man's inhumanity to beast, ""Project Nim"" ends up going past that to ask a deeper, disturbing question: Just who is the man, and who is the beast?"
815	5	a	Good performances, but it's difficult to give two hoots about Close's passion project when the story remains as pinched and hermetic as poor little Albert Nobbs himself.
816	9	a	When everything is finally revealed, the story Vantage Point tells is fairly pedestrian, and nothing special is gained from all the stopping and restarting.
817	3	a	The breadth of the film's scope is impressive, as it manages to sketch in the enormity and diversity of the movement without being spread too thin.
818	5	a	The animation is perfectly colorful and the voice actors earn their paychecks, but it's blatantly obvious that this thing started production without a screenplay -- and hit the screens without a plot.
819	2	a	Arrives in theaters just in time to be the perfect counterpoint to Hollywood's broader, dumber parade of eccentrics, Dinner for Schmucks.
820	6	a	Pleasant but consistently rather bland, a light, low-key Lifetime movie with an A-list star and wide theatrical distribution.
821	0	a	Given today's comic-book-driven climate, a picture this profound is honestly a little like a miracle.
822	3	a	It's a God's eye point-of-view that often doesn't work because having all the answers in advance can drain the picture of its intensity, but somehow Altman manages to pick up most of the slack with eccentric characters and dark, farcical humor.
823	4	a	"A gathering of a large group of friends can be energetically fun or crazy loud. ""Think Like a Man Too"" is thankfully more the first of those, though it's not afraid to be the second one either."
824	4	a	Hartnett's charm and his simmering chemistry with Sossamon ... trumps most of the film's silly and occasionally stupid excesses.
825	6	a	Six years in the making and this is As Good As It Gets?
826	0	a	Benedict Cumberbatch gives an empathy-stirring performance in the year's best biopic.
827	1	a	This ripping period drama is led with distinction by Glenn Close in an unorthodox part she has been developing for three decades.
828	3	a	A charming, quirky tale of small-town intrigue featuring a crackerjack cast.
829	3	a	While possibly impenetrable to the casual viewer, the picture succeeds as grand entertainment, with dazzling technical achievements and wonderfully exaggerated performances of galactic heroism. 
830	3	a	The latest in an overly long list of hijack films. But it's also the smartest and most appealing to date.
831	3	a	More a comedy than a romantic tale, this movie is decked out with hilarious side roles.
832	4	a	Call me. I'll see it again with you this weekend.
833	3	a	The internet had it coming and this movie delivers serious silicon schadenfreude. Come for the breaking, stay for the hacking.
834	0	a	Alexander Payne proves the modest stories can be the most powerful
835	3	a	A cocky, affectionate and very musical documentary that may make its central point a few times too often.
836	6	a	Not nearly as endearing, nor as funny, as Tim and Eric Awesome Show, Great Job, Billion Dollar Movie is likely to become a cult hit, but nothing more.
837	3	a	This bullwhip-cracking action-adventure launched the series starring Harrison Ford.
838	6	a	Costner deserves credit for continuing to make - or, at least trying to make - grown-up movies. But he's undercut at almost every point here by director Mike Binder ...
839	7	a	Put your hands up and back away from this rent-a-flop.
840	6	a	They want to show us everything, to give us our money's worth. In so doing, they've not just opened up the play, they've let most of the life out of it.
841	5	a	...the film is directed in a way that seems a trifle theatrical, or even sitcom-ish...
842	4	a	You bet your ass that Julianne Moore is overdue for Academy love. She's supremely gifted, possessing the beauty of a true star and the intuitive technique of a true actress. 
843	2	a	Despite moments of power and beauty, Scorsese's controversial film is flawed largely due to its casting, anachronistic dialogue, and blend of acting styles; yet it's a typical Scorsese film, dealing with sin, guilt, and redemption
844	8	a	Asinine [and] illiterate. 
845	6	a	It's not a bad film, per se, but it's more adequate than entertaining, more routine than recommendable.
846	3	a	Cameron, who produced and directed it, does a visually splendid job, though what he has fashioned comes down to a logistical footnote to his great, primal, heart-of- the-ocean blockbuster.
847	6	a	The film got caught up too much in the tragedy of the twin's life without coming up with much more than heavy symbolism for its answers.
848	4	a	All-in-all, the film takes you on a nostalgic trip down your childhood where you actually got to spend some carefree moments.
849	1	a	This is not an impression. This IS James Brown.
850	8	a	It's the movie sensitive teen-meister John Hughes would have made had he been strapped to a bench, a knife at his throat, with a pulsating garage band score on continuous loop placed two inches from his eardrum.
851	3	a	Painful accuracy and often hilarious insight... Steinfeld shows boldness and vulnerability.
852	4	a	Altman's latest round robin relies a little too heavily on plot, plus some of the characterizations are too eccentric for their own good. But even a minor Altman movie challenges an audience in a way few Hollywood products can.
853	6	a	Director Ken Loach often examines the lives of Britain's downtrodden, but in Sweet Sixteen his bleakness becomes too familiar.
854	3	a	Some actors have so much charisma that you'd be happy to listen to them reading the phone book. Hugh Grant and Sandra Bullock are two such likeable actors.
855	3	a	This terrifically authentic look at life inside New York's Yiddish-speaking Hasidic community is a bittersweet treat - a vibrantly engaging portrait of down-to-earth lives that is affectionate, amusing and ultimately very moving.
856	3	a	Excellent acting in poignant, mature coming-of-age story. 
857	4	a	[A]s much a disaster movie as it is a straight sci-fi horror film ... there are very good performances in the film ... but the movie leaves you feeling let-down and quarrelsome. 
858	3	a	The film largely misses its opportunities to reflect the enormity of communism, choosing instead the route of a conventional adventure yarn.
859	5	a	The umpteenth film incarnation of Henry VIII's marriage to Anne Boleyn, The Other Boleyn Girl races through the events at the Tudor court like a triple-time miniseries.
860	9	a	Meet The Spartans? For those unlucky enough to be lured into the cinema, there's every chance you'll be wanting to meet your maker instead.
861	2	a	Though it's a long ride, the movie is sure to please a patient audience with fans of political and historical dramas.
862	4	a	This movie is so intent upon getting cheap laughs and putting the protagonists in uncomfortable situations that it forgets they're supposed to be falling in love.
863	4	a	...sometimes the contrivance is obvious.
864	3	a	While it's hardly a philosophical film, the screenplay by Jeff Vintar and Akiva Goldsman does have an idea or two.
865	3	a	Many films have portrayed the rigors of ballet training, but none will make viewers wince quite like Mao's Last Dancer.
866	3	a	Selma is an always-gripping, often-bruising film, with fantastic performances and a solidly written script that contextualizes King's work in an effectively impactful way.
867	5	a	Unnecessary, lazy sequel is overly violent. 
868	3	a	"What makes this film especially engrossing is that what happened between that chimp and the humans with whom he spent his life in intimate contact turns out to be only half the story that Marsh, who directed the electrifying ""Man on Wire,"" has to tell."
869	3	a	Meditation on sex, life, death; older teens only.
870	4	a	Will Smith has always had an easy time grabbing the spotlight.
871	3	a	Into the Wild is a celebratory ode to the road and the people you meet along the way, destination be damned.
872	5	a	[These] are not the teachings one would find for oneself but things out of a self-help book. They feel planned.
873	3	a	While it does lag in some areas, it's truly an entertaining, utterly fascinating, and fantastic epic...
874	5	a	Pari asks the big question - are human beings in fact the biggest monsters? I say the biggest horror is a lame script.
875	3	a	"[Chloe] Zhao and ""The Rider"" are the real deal."
876	9	a	Every situation is completely contrived and almost wants to prove it to you.
877	3	a	The self-reflection is powerfully honest, and the landscapes are genuinely spectacular.
878	3	a	...somehow makes the extraordinary true story it's based on seem like common corn while succeeding in modest ways.
879	1	a	In a career-refining performance, Bruce Dern gives us a character in Woody Grant who's hardened by booze, hard to like and -- if his bad-dad tendencies don't cut too close to your bone -- pretty durn amusing.
880	6	a	I realized that no matter how fantastic Reign of Fire looked, its story was making no sense at all.
881	0	a	Liam Neeson should be Oscar contender for this. Film could not be more relevant.
882	3	a	Nostalgia is aplenty in the segments by Khoo, Neo, Tong, Rajagopal and Boo as they examine aspects of Singapore's past.
883	6	a	A joke that gets beaten to death in the first five minutes.
884	2	a	Harmless and enjoyable -- but it'll float right out of your brain within a couple hours of seeing it. 
885	3	a	Successfully captures the frenzied angst and boredom of youth, as well as the powerful, unbridled emotions of first love.
886	3	a	Serenity isn't about effects. It's about narrative and characters, and it does a solid job in both areas.
887	4	a	Though sold through its slightly misleading trailers as a jaunty Good Morning, Vietnam-type romp the film is a tad more sober and sombre, especially when accounting for the human cost of war.
888	8	a	Screenwriter Rob Perez knows as much about both self-discipline and Catholicism as I know about echocardiography.
889	2	a	Swells the heart in that predictable yet sweet way all come-from-behind pictures should.
890	5	a	You've always got something to look at -- whether its Sayuri's exquisitely painted face or the perfect twirl of a gorgeously flowered umbrella. But the storytelling is soap-opera banal.
891	6	a	Despite its strong visual appeal, Final Fantasy alienates the audience with strange theories that go unexplained, and characters that rival Pinocchio's reality.
892	5	a	What else can be said of a film in which even the vocal talent of J.K. Simmons is virtually indistinguishable from the rest of the cast?
893	3	a	Cormac McCarthy's book about a man who finds a case full of money at the scene of a drug deal gone very, very wrong is ideally suited for the Coen brother's understated talk and striking visuals.
894	6	a	Jacob's Ladder takes a long time getting to the point, and when it does, there isn't that much to it.
895	3	a	Probably close to being on par with Fritz Lang's Metropolis in terms of grandeur -- although of a stunningly different and far more unsettling kind.
896	3	a	While teenage tropes are dutifully checked off - the love triangle, the makeover, the party gone wrong - there's originality to Nadine's lonely quest to find her place, only to ultimately learn she's not alone in being all alone.
897	5	a	To put so much time, effort and money into something that's ultimately so lifeless seems like a waste to me.
898	4	a	Kevin Irwin - Cruise is stomachable and the production is grandly ambitious, but it's the gripping true story that triumphs as the real star.
899	0	a	Deliver Us From Evil shows us how the business of saving souls can rationalize the obscenity of selling them.
900	1	a	A very funny, very violent and altogether wonderful British crime caper that could have been made by Tarantino's cockney cousin, if he had one.
901	6	a	Too light on laughs and too heavy on predictable moments.
902	0	a	like people-watching from the point of view of a god
903	4	a	By the end, The Joneses feels a little too satisfied with its own admittedly clever conceit and for the broad leeway it allows itself in the creative bandying of logos and slogans.
904	1	a	Whatever name you want to call O'Grady, he is fascinating and frightening.
905	1	a	Thirteen Days delivers a hugely engaging look at the closest we've come to the end of the world...and makes you marvel at how we pulled back from the brink.
906	6	a	Timeline is not so much a bad movie as it is bland and routine.
907	3	a	gradually becomes more and more penetrating
908	5	a	The horror-thriller Valentine makes mistakes where its successful predecessors like Scream didn't, essentially revealing its antagonist in its casting.
909	6	a	It's downright depressing to see Oscar winners Hunt and Hurt struggling to make something meaningful out of their superficially written characters.
910	4	a	Veering from the sensational to the maudlin, this is a compromised epic that panders to the Chinese audience.
911	3	a	Had the film simply been The Annette Bening Show, we'd certainly have coped. But she's matched every step of the way by Bell, in a flat-out career-best performance achieved so naturally it's a marvel.
912	2	a	Once the film settles down, it becomes a rollicking yet melancholy tour of a city so spectacular and historic that it paralyzes its inhabitants.
913	3	a	Digging deep down, Theron and the movie give us empty lives, desperate romance and murderous rage. They bring a monster to life.
914	2	a	On one hand, it's kind of silly, on the other, these are very fine actors, and give this super-slick thriller some of the facets and angles that help make a cool object at which to gaze.
915	6	a	The action, emotion and tension of Michael Collins don't transcend the screen in a way that will engage the uninitiated.
916	0	a	An extraordinary semidocumentary drama, beautiful and beautifully accomplished, about dignity, work, and masculinity. Heartbreaking and yet utterly unsentimental, this is one of the best and most important films of the year.
917	4	a	This episode has the highest velocity and lowest IQ yet. See it on the biggest, loudest, dumbest screen you can find.
918	4	a	Bolt is a damn enjoyable and undeniably funny film.
919	6	a	Those hoping for a solid flick using the full talents of people like Woo, Cruise, Rhames, etc. will sadly be disappointed.
920	3	a	While it's as blunt as any typical big-budget war epic would be, the film finds plenty of moments in which Zhang's skill as a filmmaker and his deft handling and interest in female characters shines...
921	1	a	Zooey Deschanel steals so many scenes as Paula's anti-social roommate that she deserves to share top billing alongside McConaughey and Parker.
922	5	a	I checked my brain out, and gasp, got some entertainment value from the film. The special effects, fight choreography, and production design are actually pretty good.
923	6	a	The attempts to deepen the emotions turn Hancock into a strange, conflicted and often joyless film.
924	2	a	Third wheel's a charm when the person happens to be Owen Wilson, indulging us yet again with his lovable-slacker persona.
925	4	a	Hathaway delivers a fine British accent and high spirits as Austen.
926	3	a	All told, Total Recall is a powerful brew of mordant humor, keen wit, refreshing originality and graphic violence.
927	3	a	A sorrowful, touching look at identity and deception with rich turns by Glenn Close and Janet McTeer.
928	5	a	While not a sophomore jinx, this serio comedy about the fluidity of sexual identity among a group of youngsters is a disappointing follow-up to Troche's brilliant debut the lesbian comedy Go Fish, lacking focus and style.
929	1	a	I can't convince myself that Cosmopolis is anything other than unscripted documentary about the life of Robert Pattinson, shot by security cameras. 
930	7	a	Hey mom, I went to another planet and found money for you to buy back the family farm. Sure, I blew up the planet in the process, but aren't you proud of me?
931	1	a	That Garcia manages to spin three rich and complex yarns without ever losing hold of the main thread -- the deep and mysterious connections between mothers and daughters -- is evidence of a keen eye and an exceptionally curious mind.
932	5	a	A brilliant performance by Christian Bale can't quite keep this soulless movie afloat.
933	2	a	It's all far more complicated than it needs to be, but then again, what would you cut?
934	0	a	One of the very best films of the year. Guadagnino, a master cinema sensualist, and his award-caliber actors Chalamet, Hammer and Stuhlbarg create a love story for the ages and a new film classic. Let it in.
935	6	a	Friends With Kids is little more than a well-written and nicely delivered feature-length sitcom.
936	7	a	A mediocre film that could have been much worse.
937	8	a	Michael Mann must have mistaken neon lights, awkward sex scenes and bad pop songs for a good movie.
938	6	a	The movie seems to have been slapped together without concern about whether anything makes sense.
939	5	a	This new Phoenix makes too many mistakes, the biggest one being the mistake of confusing 'modernizing' with 'dumbing down.'
940	6	a	The film wakes up when the case goes to court, but until then it's a plodding affair and so saccharine that we have to wonder if we're really getting the whole story.
941	4	a	Superlative craftsmanship but only the first segment is intriguing.
942	2	a	An intellectually well thought out work that presents the events of those turbulent days in Irish history with clear, vivid reality, from costumes to sets to location.
943	0	a	This is a tale of toil, sacrifice, and hard-earned victory without a speck of fairy dust or dreamy-eyed fantasy.
944	4	a	Overlong but slick, this still gets away with simplistic dialogue and characters, perhaps because it doesn't take itself too seriously.
945	0	a	In a film so ripe with temptations for posturing, exaggeration and satirical overacting, nobody is anything less than natural, unpretentious and funny as hell.
946	4	a	It may not be Asimov but its plot is truly labyrinthine, it works a specific theme and it's happy to end itself in a shroud of enigma.
947	5	a	Here is a brave, or possibly foolhardy, attempt by the producers of Love Actually and Bridget Jones' Diary to infuse realism into romcom.
948	3	a	Call me hokey if you want. I just would have liked more heart in there somewhere. But the acting is superb and it's worth seeing just for that. By no means watch this over the holidays but pursue its scholarly merit on safe ground.
949	1	a	"When the credits declare, as they traditionally do, that ""James Bond will return,"" you'll be eager for that return to come as soon as possible."
950	3	a	Handsomely done and beautifully acted, just slightly wanting in a screenplay that leaves questions unanswered about what's behind these unhappy people. And it's ultra-depressing...
951	5	a	After watching Parker giggle and whine her way through this movie the audience won't care how her character does it.
952	4	a	Fantastic Four isn't even close to Sin City, Batman Begins or even Constantine, but it's a relatively quick, vibrant, focused origin story. 
953	6	a	I saw it. I didn't feel it. Look, I'm happy for Julia Roberts to travel the world. I just never felt connected to the journey of Liz. 
954	3	a	A follow-up that captures the brio and brotherly angst and affection of its predecessor, if not its clarion sense of urgency.
955	5	a	judging by the reactions of the kids at the matinee screening, the only thing that registered with the target demographic was a gag involving chipmunk poop. 
956	8	a	Tedious, snickering jokes about infant breast-feeding and adult-male boob lust? You got 'em, baby.
957	0	a	"Mendes's film certainly stands out, and there's a sense that things may be slightly different from now on. This is no reboot, more a recalibration of the format, or perhaps even, as Bond himself deftly puts it, ""a resurrection""."
958	7	a	This slapdash mess of an explosion movie wastes the talents of its cast and can't even slow down to let us enjoy the fight scenes.
959	3	a	Worryingly satisfying in a purely gruesome, beat-em-up kinda way.
960	6	a	In the end, Larry Crowne is watchable and undemanding, but it doesn't leave a lasting impression.
961	6	a	Serenity is ultimately too insular to have mass appeal.
962	5	a	Cursed with an honest title, Failure to Launch waves a white flag in scene after scene, declaring surrender.
963	5	a	Phoned-in business as usual.
964	5	a	No film in recent memory has cried out this much to be mocked.
965	5	a	Hanks and Roberts clearly seem up for a work-out, but this dull rom-com holds any potential chemistry at the mercy of poor jokes, a meandering plot and unlikeable supporting characters.
966	0	a	I have seen a lot of films about the Holocaust, but I have never seen one so immediate, unblinking and painful in its materials.
967	6	a	Too bad for Knowles that she's only part of Darnell Martin's rushed mess of a movie that jams the story of Chicago-based Chess Records into one incoherent package.
968	2	a	The delicacy to the subject matter is fortunate as it could have easily been a by the numbers film about illness, love and separation. [Full Review in Spanish]
969	3	a	Though it is in constant, breathtaking motion, Zhang Yimou's gorgeous entertainment is not especially moving.
970	6	a	The villains are overwrought and the design of Mars is surprisingly bland.
971	3	a	Bolt is earnest, wholesome, family entertainment. In a word, it's Disney, which seems to have remembered that those attributes are really nothing to be ashamed of.
972	2	a	Uneven as it is, Addams Family Values is considerably more enjoyable than its predecessor. At this rate, if there's a third installment, it'll be a knockout. Or at least a TKO.
973	3	a	The final scenes are both ambiguous and terrifying, and they left a preview audience as shaken as any I've seen.
974	4	a	[Directed] with cool efficiency.
975	3	a	Boyle's visual storytelling is fluent and imaginative, and the performances are excellent.
976	4	a	If you had hoped writer-director Cameron Crowe would return from his six-year hiatus having shed the demons of Elizabethtown, well, I've got some bad news for you... It seems you just can't reason with an unflinching optimist.
977	6	a	Inherent Vice is a bizarre, almost dreamlike, movie, one that makes sense from moment to moment but falls apart the second you try to tie it all together.
978	5	a	The film has neither topical immediacy nor any real historical perspective and, burdened with pedantic and predictable flashbacks, it finally leads nowhere interesting at all.
979	6	a	Film Stars is a basic biopic that, in spite of its fantastic leads, doesn't leave an impression.
980	3	a	Ralph Breaks The Internet still rates as a triumphant return for a beloved set of characters that will charm, exhilarate and wildly entertain on its own terms.
981	6	a	This is the kind of movie that makes you feel good about yourself because you know that you are smarter than any of the characters on screen; you just can't fight as well.
982	2	a	[A] subtle, dreamlike spooker that pits a Seattle journalist against a sinister videotape full of ominous, threatening images.
983	4	a	A work of flawed majesty.
984	2	a	Not the precision near-masterpiece that Out of Sight is, nor as tight or funny as the Ocean's films, but it's certainly got all the requisite qualities [of the genial heist movie] ... goes down smooth and easy ... the jokes raise a smile [not] a laugh.
985	2	a	What Crimson Peak does have is proper scares, thanks to performance artist Doug Jones, when he does that thing he does, reminding us how unnerving a simple arm or leg movement can be.
986	5	a	It's far too ponderous. Still, it's not wholly terrible, and that's not something you can say about Allen's films very often these days.
987	0	a	Splendid acting by Sean Penn as the merchant, Kevin Bacon as the cop, Laurence Fishburne as his partner, Tim Robbins as Dave, and Laura Linney and Marcia Gay Harden as the central female characters in the story.
988	5	a	Interesting if not entirely successful.
989	3	a	"There was nothing that I could point to and say, ""That was stupid."" Considering the atomic wasteland of superhero properties committed to film, that's saying a lot."
990	6	a	The intense and excessive climactic set piece caper scene is the only true highlight in a superficial film.
991	1	a	This is perhaps the only science-fiction film that can be called transcendental.
992	6	a	Cutesy stuff, breezily amusing but...a basically weightless and disposable date movie.
993	1	a	The best Bond film since I don't know what ... never less than gripping.
994	3	a	It wouldn't be measurable in g-forces, but there is enough forward motion in The Bourne Identity to pin audiences backwards and enough nervous tension to put them on the edge.
995	4	a	Given Dave Grohl's reputation for versatility and good taste, the film's sturdy sense of forward motion may come as no surprise.
996	3	a	"Certainly isn't the ""best"" horror film made by Hammer Film Productions... What it is, maybe, is the ""Hammer-est"" Hammer film."
997	1	a	This is a big, all-stops-out blockbuster and it delivers.
998	3	a	Successfully envelops us in a disturbing experience.
999	5	a	When we see something with so little difference from humans, it just makes clearer how important that difference is.
1000	6	a	Despite its flaws, the movie leaves you feeling good, which is about all it aspires to.
1001	3	a	isn't necessarily one of the best films of its era, but it does capture in its essence the complex nature of relationships and the unavoidable way that power dynamics can come to a head
1002	3	a	Hereafter is an entertaining film. That said, it would have been even better had it picked any one of the plot strands and focused exclusively on it. 
1003	5	a	Filled with ideas that aren't credible even in a zany comedy.
1004	5	a	Fellow critics, just because a film purports political views doesn't make them any less non-sensical.
1005	9	a	Directed by Steve Carr, a man who knows how to put a camera in front of things, if little else, and written, sort of, by Nick Bakay and Mr. James.
1006	4	a	Doesn't quite hit a home run, but a nice try
1007	5	a	It has the odd moment but without the likes of Arnold Schwarzenegger, Danny Glover or Adrien Brody the cast feels distinctly under-powered.
1008	5	a	There's treating a ridiculous story seriously, and then there's believing that a ridiculous story is serious, and I, Frankenstein falls into the latter category.
1009	4	a	If it wasn't already obvious from glancing at the studio's other work from around the same period, this would be proof enough that the steam was starting to go out of Disney's art.
1010	2	a	This is an uncharacteristically unsubtle work from Lee-yet in the end, it's not ineffective.
1011	4	a	An entertaining if lifeless sequel, failing to capture the fun and vivacity of the first two films. Something of a Greatest Hits album thrown into the shops in time for Christmas.
1012	4	a	Fanny deserved more than just a generic place in the heavens as a Great Lover Thwarted by Fate. Bright Star is only second-magnitude.
1013	7	a	This film would've been a lot funnier if the filmmaker's had shown the slightest bit of imagination in terms of the plot's comic possibilities.
1014	3	a	Russell opts for chaos over clarity and love over work
1015	1	a	A brilliantly crafted comedy with multiple layers.
1016	1	a	Awkward as it may be, Matchstick Men's conclusion is a comparatively small sin attached to an otherwise superlative character study and comedy of deceit.
1017	0	a	A vivid and carefully produced work of poignancy and loss.
1018	3	a	You feel that one false move from anyone could bring the whole thing crashing down to earth: fortunately, Russell's cast seem to have an innate sense of exactly how far they can push it.
1019	4	a	A Hawaiian honeymoon turns sinister in this effective but absurd thriller from writer-director David Twohy.
1020	6	a	The main story of Paul's struggle to maintain his idealism in the face of a changing world is pretty dull, uninspired stuff.
1021	2	a	I'm never a big fan of animal films and I admit it's because, though I am by no means a crier, pets losing their friends or getting lost gets me all choked up. Frankly, it's embarrassing. But if you can make me sniffle, you've won me over. Bolt...sniff
1022	6	a	If I Origins ends up a slog, it's at least occasionally lovely to look at.
1023	3	a	The title is a lie--this really a tandem act, unthinkable without either of its two central parts.
1024	4	a	A perfectly serviceable Jet Li/DMX vehicle.
1025	10	a	Relentless in its pursuit of suspenseless mediocrity, Valentine succeeds only in boring you to death, the most horrifying fate of all.
1026	4	a	Michod provides little insight into his lethally purposeful avenger, save a rueful musing on the value of guilt and the need to dwell on your sins...when he's not blazing away with fatal abandon.
1027	3	a	One of the all-time great ghost movies, and certainly the funniest.
1028	4	a	It is, however, a heartfelt and painstaking attempt at dealing in filmic terms with the complex and ambiguous subject matter of the book.
1029	3	a	Logan's Lucky feels like a filmmaker re-indulging a passion. It's beautifully shot, as stylish as ever, impeccably acted and typically articulate.
1030	9	a	Only a truly unhappy, crabbed mind could possibly imagine most of these jokes.
1031	0	a	Payne delivers a portrait of small-town America as observant as Picture Show, and a poignant/fun road movie that serves as a companion to the similarly toned Sideways.
1032	7	a	Pretentious claptrap.
1033	3	a	Brilliant archive footage and blistering live performances - an exhilarating concert film.
1034	6	a	Features inexplicable actions, dubious coincidences, and characters you'd happily murder yourself given half a chance.
1035	9	a	A moth-eaten stranded-in- the-desert yarn so manipulative that the involuntary jolts of adrenaline it produces make you feel like a fool.
1036	7	a	Binder, who once made lowbrow comedies but now specializes in middlebrow dramedies, is in several leagues over his head with this story ...
1037	4	a	Country Strong has a bit more to recommend it -- the music most of all -- but it's still a tough slog through emotional swamplands.
1038	9	a	Superman IV: The Quest for Peace could be one of those 'so bad it is good' movies for some people but I couldn't even find it funny.
1039	4	a	Rules of Engagement suffers from a serious split personality disorder.
1040	9	a	...another indigestible holiday turkey...
1041	2	a	One of those rare pieces of 'all ages entertainment' that will actually work for all ages, Enchanted succeeds most of all as a showcase for its superb leading lady.
1042	1	a	The journey is definitely the destination in Embrace of the Serpent. 
1043	3	a	Intense Ethiopian film makes case for girls'/women's rights.
1044	1	a	Takes an unbiased and compelling look at the anatomy of a natural born serial killer.
1045	6	a	It's a slight story to begin with, and the movie teeters on camp with its jokey filler material.
1046	6	a	Billed as a romance, it is not a very good one in spite of a somewhat original story. Eventually it turns into a soap opera and has nowhere unpredictable to go. 
1047	1	a	Clever, funny and thoroughly entertaining from beginning to end.
1048	4	a	It's all technically brilliant, but maybe lacking a little in charm and true wit.
1049	5	a	Ugly, stupid, loud, offensive, and pointlessly violent.
1050	4	a	Fincher's Dragon Tattoo is a faithful adaptation that brings the dazzle but shortchanges on the daring... It's gloriously rendered but too impersonal to leave a mark.
1051	2	a	A wholly unique family film that can moisten your eyes even while it quickens your pulse.
1052	4	a	Constantly bounces between rotten and fresh, resulting in a tomato that's always resetting its own five-second rule on a dirty floor.
1053	4	a	Such was my 'exfivement', I couldn't remember the last time I was on the edge of my seat during an action sequence like this.
1054	4	a	The Godfather II it isn't, but for teens with money to burn, there are worse options to curdle blood.
1055	6	a	The movie throws itself headlong toward the ridiculous when it begins to live up to its title.
1056	3	a	It's worth a visit if you want to check out the latest emotional vibes emanating from the Hollywood Hills.
1057	3	a	This is one of Cage's most endearingly goofy performances.
1058	4	a	If not for Sienna Miller's engaging portrayal of Edie Sedgwick, Factory Girl would have little to offer.
1059	1	a	For as much as Hombre is a film of its time, it endures as an example of how deeper examinations of the rifts that divide individuals and nations are forever contemporary.
1060	10	a	With the passing of the production torch to infamous budget tightwads Golan and Globus, it was clear that the worst was yet to come.
1061	6	a	Nobody talks - they are either emoting lofty speeches, quoting Caesar, pouring forth heartfelt sentiments, preaching Bible verses or praying.
1062	5	a	Sadly the movie conforms to all the music-biopic stereotypes we've seen in Walk the Line, Ray and Dreamgirls.
1063	6	a	Lemmons adds themes of religious hypocrisy and the cyclical effects of poverty, but marries the two for her resolution, abandoning real answers for a fairy tale climax while her symbolic Mary and Joseph figures are left out in the cold.
1064	2	a	Like the computer-ad dates on screen, this promises much more than it delivers.
1065	4	a	Easy to admire but considerably harder to enjoy.
1066	5	a	Snipes and Harrelson are still good together, but the screenplay stinks.
1067	5	a	An interesting film weakened by ham-fisted writing and direction and heavy-handed revisionism.
1068	5	a	Mediocre sci-fi. Gained a cult following, for some unknown reason.
1069	3	a	A gentle, fuzzy version of the Dickens classic.
1070	3	a	A most welcome treat.
1071	6	a	Meg Ryan gives a solid peformance in this flawed melodrama about alcoholics
1072	9	a	The essential daftness isn't helped by the stars, who play it straight when they should have gone for laughs.
1073	4	a	It's worth watching for Hiddleston's performance and the pure spectacle of it, especially if you're a Del Toro fan, but otherwise there's not much to write home about.
1074	4	a	Barry Levy's script slavers for comparisons to Rashomon but misses the point. Akira Kurosawa argued that truth was slippery; Levy believes there's one answer, he just likes withholding it.
1075	4	a	Taken simply as a Will Smith Summer Blockbuster, I, Robot scores above average.
1076	1	a	A dark coming-of-age tale told by way of a provocative script, and superbly acted.
1077	1	a	This latest installment, which firmly cements Daniel Craig as one of the best Bonds ever, feels more serious, less gimmicky, more geared towards mature adults.
1078	1	a	Like its titular Guatemalan volcano, Jayro Bustamante's hypnotic film debut Ixcanul bubbles with the tension of a teenage girl at odds with her family's native customs, before erupting into a frantic and quietly devastating third act.
1079	5	a	This tired, neutered action thriller won't cause you max pain, but you might wince every now and again.
1080	1	a	Una cinta por instantes hermosa, casi siempre demoledora, pero sin duda alguna, profundamente pasional.
1081	7	a	A low-down, no-darn-good movie. But terribly fascinating anyway, if more in theory than actuality.
1082	2	a	It's really Harris' movie, and he brings to it just the right blend of engaging affability, gruff strength of character and transcendent nobility of spirit to make it a genuinely enriching experience.
1083	5	a	Couples, a sputtering if sporadically amusing misfire, packed a lot of actors off to a pretty location and gave them nothing funny or deep to do.
1084	1	a	This stylish noir thriller is one of Blak Edwards' best films and one of the genre's highlights, well acted by Lee Remick, exquisitely shot by Philip Lathrop, and moodily composed by Henry Mancini, who contributes a great jazz score
1085	4	a	Sick as it is, it captures more of the joy of movie-going than virtually any other summer movie this year.
1086	2	a	Buddy and Abby's awkward friendship and eventual love affair are pleasant enough but never particularly engaging.
1087	0	a	It's an astonishing story, and one of the year's best documentaries.
1088	3	a	There are insights into old age, pearls of wisdom and gags galore, all wrapped up in a coating that's more akin to a bitter lemon than sugar.
1089	4	a	In the same way the beefed-up Theron fills the movie's tightly composed frames to bursting while pushing everything else to the margins, her showstopping rage blows through film like a tornado.
1090	8	a	Oh, it will have you screaming all right, but not for the desired reasons.
1091	1	a	Penn's melancholic epic is a slam-dunk.
1092	1	a	Look, I think this is a fabulous film. 
1093	4	a	Wildly uneven in tone it may be, but this 'Unforgiven with a sewing machine' revenge comedy is also something of a guilty pleasure, and has definite cult potential.
1094	4	a	Contrived? Sure. Predictable? Mostly. Soapy? You bet. But with a cast like this, who cares?
1095	5	a	All we mostly get to see is the sad, silent contemplation of an old, weary, prosthetically constructed man
1096	0	a	The most gorgeous movie of the year.
1097	6	a	The success of Ted will ensure crowds flock to this sequel but when you put the films side by side, it's each to see which one generates the most laughs.
1098	3	a	It's a sly film that slips through your fingers, leaving the glitter of great performances, but one you'll be hustling to watch again. 
1099	4	a	As with the first three films in the series, it is more a showcase for puppetry and animatronics than for acting or directing...
1100	1	a	"First Reformed"" is the kind of film that will stay with you long after the credits."
1101	1	a	It is, at its heart, an emotional story about love and betrayal. In many ways, it is Yimou's most accomplished and beautiful film.
1102	3	a	A taut drama with great performances and a recipe for action and tension that modern-day thrillers could learn from.
1103	4	a	Don't expect Aliens but don't resign yourself to Ghosts of Mars either.
1104	3	a	Nelson strips the Holocaust film of all sentimentality evoking the daily horrors as even 'Schindler's List' did not do.
1105	4	a	The Passion of the Christ is something of a masterpiece, terrible to behold, unfit for children, certainly, but very much the work of a director in the throes of his own distinct passion.
1106	4	a	A friend and I go to a 'sort of trashy' movie every Christmas. This was less trashy than most.
1107	4	a	swift pace and dry humor far more entertaining than most late night offerings
1108	1	a	If the worst thing I Heart Huckabees does is ask you to think too much, then let all movies be this bad.
1109	3	a	A slight-but-charming French heart-warmer that gives Omar Sharif his best role since... well, since Lawrence of Arabia.
1110	4	a	Jocelyn Moorhouse's latest feature is lively and enjoyable enough, and often gorgeous to look at, but undermined by its shifting storytelling styles.
1111	6	a	It's a pretty film and well acted, but neither can save The Light Between Oceans from being a disappointment.
1112	3	a	Alpha Dog is good filmmaking.
1113	4	a	No classic but not a dog in spite of being about one.
1114	2	a	A refreshing way to build a story that is ghoulishly overfamiliar in nearly all its particulars.
1115	4	a	A lean and gritty western.
1116	4	a	If you want to see some spectacularly adorable if not particularly lasting or memorable dog tricks, The Artist is the film you've been waiting for.
1117	1	a	Eastwood's best since Unforgiven.
1118	6	a	A phoenix may rise from the ashes, but the movie just crashes and burns.
1119	6	a	So willfully, smugly eccentric that it grows tiresome rather quickly.
1120	5	a	A good-hearted but exceptionally bland 'coming-out-of-age' movie modeled after the John Hughes high school pictures of the eighties.
1121	3	a	How reassuring to realize that happy surprises are still possible. Hitch is one of the happiest.
1122	3	a	So the unlikely allies: A robot hater, a robot lover and a robot, all team up to solve the case. It's kinda cute.
1123	1	a	Without Moore's uncompromising, brilliant work, this would be a mediocre film, so the way she elevates it into a work of art is nothing less than astonishing.
1124	9	a	Simple and bland...
1125	6	a	It's a shame Battles loses his nerve in the final act, weirdly assuming viewers have developed an emotional attachment to material that works best as a cartoon. 
1126	9	a	A movie that could be stupider only if it were longer.
1127	4	a	I found it quite charming - and I don't normally do charming.
1128	1	a	Forgettable horror -- more gory than psychological -- with a highly satisfying quotient of Friday-night excitement and Milla power.
1129	5	a	You can't help but wonder where the fine actor in The Departed and even Invincible has gone. It's not been a good year for Wahlberg: First The Happening, and now this.
1130	5	a	What is it about Robin Williams that he often appears in these wild misfires, pictures that are so full of promise yet so disastrous in execution?
1131	2	a	A dark thriller that mines the meanings of family skeletons, power, corruption, sex, and misogyny.
1132	8	a	Jackson has come back to Middle Earth to compose his most masturbatory effort yet.
1133	3	a	While hardly a film for the ages, it is exceptionally effective at what it sets out to achieve - namely, pumping up the tension, tossing us a few red herrings, then blindsiding us with the Big Surprise.
1134	4	a	This film will likely be enjoyed by anyone who has gone through their own share of 'clingy' girlfriends with a number of laughs and enough overall entertainment to recommend to anyone looking for a fun night out with their honey.
1135	2	a	The film is just as clumsy about psychological issues as Hollywood movies generally are, but Jennifer Lawrence's performance makes all that moot.
1136	4	a	Fun, funny and affectionate, though it packs the emotional wallop of an undernourished high school nerd.
1137	9	a	No high-octane, fast-paced shoot 'em up this, Max Payne may well be the most tedious trip to a cinema you make all year. Truly, the minutes pass like hours. It's akin to one of those straight-to-DVD titles you only ever find in petrol stations.
1138	3	a	... a terrific, smart and thoroughly engaging family film.
1139	3	a	A touching, humorous and enjoyable film.
1140	4	a	There's a quaintness to Songcatcher that keeps it from truly expressing the power of these songs, and how they voice the hardscrabble life eked out on the beautiful but harsh mountainsides.
1141	4	a	Compelling but uneven dramedy has swearing, drinking, more.
1142	2	a	astute and brisk though not always as concise as one would hope
1143	5	a	The biggest problem with Man of the Year is that, much like American Dreamz, which came out earlier this year, it simply doesn't seem to know what genre it aspires to be.
1144	6	a	So nice and upbeat and eager to please that other movies might beat it up on the playground.
1145	0	a	A look at old Hollywood that's not just weird, but truly unsettling.
1146	5	a	Despite the odd rip-roaring tune and some sturdy performances, this yuletide tale is as memorable as last year's sprouts.
1147	2	a	Writer-director Cameron Crowe manages to take what could have been a maudlin disaster and turn it into a workable film.
1148	2	a	Whether it tickles your funny bone is likely going to be entirely dependent on how warped your sense of humor is and how easily you can ignore some of its more unsavory elements.
1149	5	a	"A gimmicky thriller without much of a gimmick or many thrills, ""Vantage Point"" suffers, too, from being out of synch with its time."
1150	6	a	It is disappointing and you look at all the talent that's gone into it. I was really underwhelmed by Strahovski's performance, I must say.
1151	9	a	If anybody ever makes a good film about the early days of the Beatles, I would love to see it. My recommendation is to pass this one by and look for one of the many Beatles documentaries if you want to know more.
1152	9	a	The situations are dumb, the characters asinine, and every 'gag' line flops with a sickening splat.
1153	0	a	Park's love for all his characters, good and evil, is literally palpable: These characters have been forged of clay, fussed over, posed, photographed over a period of years.
1154	2	a	Milne's characters represent adult themes, and the screenplay reflects this: Eeyore's self-deprecation and depression, Piglet's crippling anxiety, Pooh's somehow wise idiocy, and Tigger's ego.
1155	3	a	The picture is a small-scale symphony of kinetic camera movements, rapid-fire montage sequences, split-screen effects, and long-lasting shots that allow characters and settings to interact more artfully than happens in less-imaginatively filmed movies.
1156	2	a	Mary Queen of Scots is more than a textbook period piece. It shows how to create a feminist-friendly, diverse biopic with all the dramatic dynamics of a political potboiler.
1157	0	a	Rock-solid proof that Lucas CAN write characters ... or at least COULD. Great cast, warm nostalgia, and wonderful music.
1158	1	a	Its Oscar-worthy production values come together to create an epic, and exquisitely melancholy, evocation of Europe's once confident but now dying world order.
1159	8	a	Although most of the jokes fall flat and the action isn't all that creative, what's missing most from the film is a sense of wonder and magic.
1160	3	a	Johnny Depp is a master of his craft...Burton's film lacks nothing
1161	3	a	Smart, funny, great performances
1162	3	a	A movie to be discussed with those invested in being agents of justice. It raises serious questions about a system that does not protect those most vulnerable -- the poor.
1163	4	a	There's no need for overstatement here, no need to inject this story with melodrama, no need to try to make it more than it is. Unfortunately - and frustratingly - Zhang Yimou didn't recognize that.
1164	6	a	It's all as well-mounted and temperate as you would expect from Lee, but I can't fathom why he thought this material was worth his time, as all the fuss adds up to war bad, soldiers good.
1165	6	a	The problem with this tepid, senior-centric Christmas comedy is that it never really gets going. It's seasonal sludge.
1166	6	a	This is as stupid as movies come.
1167	3	a	I admired the film enough to someday soon give it a second chance...
1168	3	a	"Killer Joe"" is one hell of a movie. It left me speechless. I can't say I loved it. I can't say I hated it."
1169	2	a	A thoroughly entertaining adaptation of Burroughs's second most famous literary creation, with enough adventure and humor to satisfy all but those who are wholly dead inside.
1170	3	a	In short, Snakes on a Plane delivers exactly what it promised and then some. And how often can you say that about a movie these days?
1171	4	a	To its own detriment, William Friedkin's splattery, southern gothic return to the screen seeks to amuse as well as shake and stir.
1172	3	a	I don't know anyone who'd want to watch, in these miserable times, a marriage swirling down life's khazi. But that doesn't stop it being a fine piece of work. And while I didn't enjoy it at all, I can definitely recommend it.
1173	4	a	More of a bludgeon of evangelism than a work of art.
1174	5	a	The finished entity feels like a rip-off of a film that ripped-off several rip-offs of Carter's own ancient source material. 
1175	3	a	Nicolas Cage, a born Hollywood skin-walker, somehow hints at a spiritual dimension to all this lunatic mayhem.
1176	6	a	"The delightful premise of the film somehow becomes preposterous. It's a phenomenon in indie films I describe as ""quirk overload."
1177	6	a	When the thriller plot collides with the comedy, what's left is mangled, twisted wreckage ...
1178	4	a	A movie that features very intense, action-packed moments, but a story that gets overly complicated and borders on spinning out of control as it becomes too farfetched by the end
1179	6	a	Here is a movie so concerned with in-jokes and updates for Trekkers that it can barely tear itself away long enough to tell a story.
1180	0	a	There are few pictures more deserving of critical revisionism. 
1181	6	a	Writer-director Craig Bolotin wants to get our motors racing, our minds pondering and our hearts pumping. Laudable goals; shaky results.
1182	4	a	The movie is a far more convincing fantasy of performance-as-self-discovery than the High School Musical franchise.
1183	4	a	No lawyers getting eaten, no white-knuckle tension and nothing shocking. A bit of a disappointment.
1184	3	a	Roger Vadim's ultra-kitsch sci-fi classic somehow improves with age.
1185	8	a	It's a movie about starting over when you're past your prime, a message that must also be an analogy for its aging stars. But it only proves that some stars should just bow out when they have nothing else going for them.
1186	9	a	Chadwick and Morgan have cooked up a potboiler, the sort of thing that might have been fun to watch with Bette Davis and Joan Crawford as the Boleyn sisters, while Charles Laughton lasciviously eyed the backs of their necks as Henry.
1187	3	a	Three Billboards is great.
1188	4	a	It's far from ground-breaking in its social statements, but Black or White is still a solid comedy/drama buoyed by good performances all around.
1189	9	a	the whole movie rests on the interaction of the two characters and the appeal of the stars who embody them
1190	4	a	No future classic, but a pleasant little movie with a fiercely devoted little hero.
1191	1	a	I think there should be a lot more movies like Tremors out there, and no I don't mean more sequels.
1192	1	a	The film stuck, and even now almost a month later I can still savor and relish so many of the picture's minute delicacies as if I had just witnessed them for the very first time.
1193	3	a	You see it to jump in your seat; you wind with something even freakier: you get to watch what it's like to live when life is no longer worth living.
1194	4	a	A solidly crafted piece of genre filmmaking.
1195	3	a	With his steely, don't-mess-with-me aura, Jackson is ideally cast as Carter. When he blows his whistle and demands that everyone do wind sprints, you might think he means you, too.
1196	3	a	Scribes Marc Hyman, Mark Schwahn and Jon Zack have crafted a snappy romp about right, wrong, and the teasing in-between.
1197	2	a	This is a strange, politically incorrect and controversial film. It defies all expectations.
1198	2	a	Sadly, the good isn't as good as the best King adaptations, and the bad isn't as funny as the worst ones. 
1199	7	a	Grownup audience members may fidget more than their kids.
1200	3	a	Very little kids shouldn't be brought to see this entertaining, funny, and scary, animated PG ...feisty send-up of popular culture and Disney in theaters.
1201	10	a	An extremely dull and unfunny comedy with pop-culture references where the gags should be, and humdrum voicings.
1202	10	a	Plotless collection of moronic stunts is by far the worst movie of the year.
1203	4	a	The drama in question, Ang Lee's Taking Woodstock, is a bit like the festival itself - a happy mess.
1204	2	a	Elio might have come across as a bit of a prat were it not for his flickering, on-the-edge-of-adulthood beauty, which helps to mitigate some of his... actions. His emotional vulnerability in the face of his desire makes him universally accessible.
1205	4	a	[The film] keeps its taste levels deep in the gutter, for sure, but if you are not too prudish and don't mind a bit of low-down dirty fun, then there is just about enough here to drag it over the line. Just.
1206	1	a	This is no tale of paranormal activity. It offers no clear-cut answers on life after death. Rather, it calmly examines death, grief and melancholy, packing an unexpectedly profound emotional gut-punch.
1207	5	a	It's harmless junk for small kids -- but no matter how harmless, it's still junk.
1208	4	a	When it's all said and done, there's no real call for any emotional investment on the part of Almodovar's audience.
1209	6	a	The Edge of Love is the sort of muddled melodrama that has little to say about love, or anything else.
1210	4	a	An enjoyable appetizer, albeit for a meal that one could argue already has far too many courses.
1211	1	a	A well-written historical drama that also feels fiercely contemporary.
1212	3	a	It's silly and sweet, but never cloyingly so
1213	3	a	Paz's return to the ring is inherently inspiring, so writer-director Ben Younger is already off to a good start, but Younger adds some intriguing touches that give the film a feeling of authenticity that makes the Cinderella story seem less sappy.
1214	6	a	Stay is all dressed up with no place to go, an eye-popping exercise in lavish style unattached to any discernible content.
1215	1	a	Moan offers that rare cinematic escape into another dimension. When the lights come up, make sure you know of a blues bar nearby. You're not gonna be ready for the ho-hum of the real world.
1216	6	a	It's been six years since the last James Brooks comedy, so we might have expected a little rust. But not this weathered thing -- How Do You Know is so oxidized it's stuck.
1217	5	a	That it wastes the talent of two young actors with star potential is upsetting, that it insults its audience is frankly unforgivable.
1218	3	a	Cassavetes' film is pure Hollywood fiction and sensationalism mixed with some sense of reality, but hell I enjoyed it a great deal...
1219	9	a	Surely Winslet can find better roles than this.
1220	7	a	"The To Do List"" is another one of those films that begs the question of how the writer ever thought it was a good idea."
1221	6	a	The chemistry of the core cast - steered by Vin Diesel and Paul Walker - keeps this outing from running on fumes.
1222	2	a	Anderson's greatest display of formal elasticity.
1223	3	a	Alpha Dog is almost a sociological study of a youthful culture awash in freedom and steeped in violence, drugs, casual sex and offensive language. It also shines a light on parents who have abdicated their positions of guidance and discipline.
1224	3	a	"Fast Five"" is the perfect definition of a guilty-pleasure movie. In this film, what stunt drivers and stunt people do with their machines and bodies defy the laws of physics, nature and reason."
1225	6	a	Much of the film's attempted laughs come from the comedy-of-discomfort school, with an endless array of situations that milk awkwardness to a degree that makes these scenes far more unpleasant than humorous to watch.
1226	2	a	Director Lewis, like his script, works to keep us unbalanced.
1227	5	a	It's a MADtv or Saturday Night Live sketch dressed up in feature-length clothing. It's way too much of an OK thing. And the way-too-much-ness goes on and on.
1228	6	a	I wish the film version of Astro Boy provided a stronger antidote to mediocrity....the script takes its sweet time establishing its rules and locale, then rolls in one too many subplots.
1229	1	a	"Crank: High Voltage is a real celebration of the phrase ""Why not?"". It's big, loud and brainless - and it's all the more glorious for it."
1230	4	a	The most visually exciting movie to come along this year.
1231	4	a	It seems that Michael Caine is passing the acting baton, however indirectly, to Jude Law.
1232	0	a	An Oscar-winning trio of comic tales - from a trio of legends.
1233	1	a	There are last minute rescues and incredible visuals.
1234	3	a	This film, by turns macabre, melodramatic, and gothic, makes the heart race and the skin crawl.
1235	9	a	If you're unfortunate enough to head down the path of seeing this film, that will be the only Wrong Turn you'll likely remember.
1236	4	a	Will Smith's charisma helps make this sweet, slight romantic comedy about a modern Cupid a light and disposable pleasure.
1237	4	a	God love Coach Carter and what he's done to improve real kids' educations. But movies shouldn't feel like school, even when their subject is learning.
1238	4	a	Letters To God keeps letting the story be interrupted by the sponsor, which in this case is Christianity.
1239	4	a	The great screenwriter Steven Zaillian's elaborate, convoluted script, so muddled that even after it's over you still don't know what it's all about, is a drawback -- but the movie is a master class in sinister style, tense and deeply uncomfortable.
1240	5	a	Without a strongly sympathetic figure at the center of the movie, Jacob's plight seems very remote. Watching this film should feel like being caught in a nightmare, but it feels more like watching someone else who is caught in a nightmare.
1241	4	a	The material it does pull off is daring and sharp.
1242	8	a	'Snakes are definitely a mid-air danger,' said Homeland Security chief Michael Chertoff. 'It's on the list right before 'holding your palm in front of a pilot's eyes to block his view.'
1243	4	a	Flaws acknowledged, 'Cobra Verde' is a stunning, beautiful epic.
1244	9	a	The violent, nihilistic and tedious revenge drama emerges as this year's standard for meaningless.
1245	4	a	Veers too much and too often into the realm of palpable manipulation.
1246	5	a	It fails as a star vehicle, a recession-era satire, a WTF white-collar-grunt revenge tale, a Midnight Run-style buddy flick, a gross-out laughfest and a bathetic tale of broken souls.
1247	3	a	Hornet is a hilarious and action packed film that is one of the most satisfying action-buddy-comedies ever made.
1248	4	a	There's something silly-sweet about this movie. It avoids talking down to kids or being didactic, while still projecting an overall wholesomeness.
1249	3	a	A brilliant comedy in which we laugh that we do not cry -- although we do wince, as every expectation the main character has of things turning out okay crumbles and his face gets ever the redder.
1250	4	a	Every moment that's meant to be touching is laughable, but the moments when we're supposed to be laughing are just funny enough to carry the movie along.
1251	2	a	...lazy and uninspired and, worst of all, displays a certain contempt for [the] audience
1252	0	a	Ordinarily, I wouldn't have crossed the road to see Moore and Duchovny together, but their relationship works both before and after the film's outragous left-field twist.
1253	4	a	Invictus does leave you feeling oddly satisfied, but it's a very fleeting satisfaction, perhaps because its rainbow nation conclusion immediately starts to ring hollow once the euphoria of the triumphant sports movie ending subsides.
1254	9	a	A cheerless sequel to an uninspired remake.
1255	4	a	It's an uneven film, almost pleasingly vague in its conclusions yet also unsatisfying.
1256	4	a	Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri may be McDonagh's most satisfying film to date, but the London-born playwright's bard-of-the-Ozarks ventriloquism isn't exact and his construction hasn't shed all traces of the stage.
1257	5	a	Could qualify as a case study in just how quickly and thoroughly computer-animated studio releases have declined to a state of inspiration-depleted, assembly-line anthropomorphism.
1258	5	a	The choreography is clumsy, the acting caricatured, and the songs themselves painfully overblown.
1259	4	a	Fun and amazingly rendered, but ultimately a little flat.
1260	4	a	This set-up and development is fascinating, the payoff less so.
1261	3	a	Fun, yet unsurprisingly conventional.
1262	3	a	Cadillac Records is a rollicking and insightful celebration of Chicago blues in its hectic golden age.
1263	9	a	The talented cast is left high and dry by writer/director [Paul] Weitz.
1264	6	a	And while Mulroney is definitely a breathlessly sexy performer even under the worst circumstances, he's given little to do here except act like a sexual Yoda and look wistfully at Messing.
1265	8	a	One of the best films out there, and certainly a high point in early cinema. The love for Citizen Kane is deserved.
1266	1	a	The tones shift rampantly, which for some viewers can be disorienting and off-putting. But, if you're in tune with Demme's aesthetic, which usually runs counter to our cinematic intuition, it is a wild ride indeed. 
1267	0	a	You'd have to possess a very hard heart not to find something to love in this story.
1268	3	a	Here is a tough, complex morality play in the guise of a good, old-fashioned melodrama.
1269	0	a	Francois Truffaut's debut film not only galvanized the Nouvelle Vague movement of French cinema, but he also generated a personal filmic idiom that he would elaborate on for the rest of his career.
1270	6	a	...just another ill-conceived and executed endeavor from a director well past his prime.
1271	4	a	While a fine showcase of a great screen actor's talents, and an admirable depiction of an all-too-common disease, it is a grind, and one wonders if the filmmakers had an audience in mind.
1272	9	a	Not only awful but also possessed of the potential for being truly offensive to the victims of the atrocities off which it pings.
1273	3	a	A compelling, enlightening, and emotionally absorbing real time documentation of the quest for a reincarnated Tibetan master.
1274	4	a	The film plays more like a fable than a story of earthbound humans, and a fractured fairy tale at that.
1275	2	a	"It's enjoyable, a ""Chinatown"" of its period, but it lacks the transportive psychedelia I expected, playing, and even more oddly often looking, rather flat."
1276	1	a	Lots of fun and action, laughs and mystery, and really, isn?t that why we love Harry Potter? Branagh brilliant.
1277	0	a	Richly compelling and disturbing.
1278	1	a	Literally the kind of movie they just don't make anymore...
1279	4	a	If you're in the mood for the cinematic equivalent of sugar and trans fats, the film delivers with one physics-defying set piece after another.
1280	7	a	gets too literal, then goes overboard into outright ludicrousness
1281	4	a	Careful is one long and amusing pun on German Expressionistic film imagery, Freudian psychology and quasi-Wagnerian storytelling, all carried to absurdist lengths.
1282	4	a	I enjoyed it - or much of it - for reasons that have everything to do with Johnny Depp.
1283	5	a	No amount of fiddling with funny glasses in the theatre will keep you from noticing a weak storyline.
1284	2	a	There's something wonderful about chaotic ethnic comedies, and this film taps straight into that vein.
1285	3	a	As usual, heart and soul have been poured into an enterprise that Parker and Stone want you to think they just knocked off after a night of smoking weed.
1286	4	a	Together these characters generate so much chemistry that - for awhile at least - we can ignore the movie's shortcomings.
1287	6	a	The Rover fascinates and frustrates in equal measure, with Michod withholding details of plot and character so thoroughly that a nihilistic fog sets in.
1288	10	a	An unintentionally uproarious melodrama; a must-see for fans of the truly terrible
1289	2	a	This unsettling drama, with Theron's character immersion, may not thrive at the boxoffice but it's done with enough integrity to merit a supportive audience.
1290	2	a	But if it doesn't exactly feel revelatory or deeply explored as a historical document, it's still an intriguing story, capably told.
1291	4	a	Hoffman and Linney sadly never click, in spite of their strong performances...
1292	4	a	The kind of movie that exists solely to facilitate a great performance in the lead role, and Julianne Moore provides one.
1293	1	a	Hollywood once upon a time made films exploring these kinds of issues, but in today's climate only a filmmaker like Eastwood, determined to never do the same thing twice, would have the nerve and the clout to take it on.
1294	5	a	The cinematic equivalent of watching a balloon deflate slowly, agonizingly, through a microscopic pinprick.
1295	1	a	Horror is as old as movie pictures, but this film shows it still holds dark depths to explore.
1296	4	a	The performances are amiable and committed, and the comedy more often than not hits the bullseye.
1297	3	a	A dramedy that compels us to take a hard look at our Mars-like capacities and our addictions to adrenaline-sparking situations.
1298	5	a	The movie lumbers from dopey comedy to toothless satire to straight-faced social commentary to half-realized thriller, none of it particularly successful.
1299	6	a	The third time around is at least one time too many.
1300	2	a	Reminds you that you can still find small treasures in all the piles of low-budget cinematic junk that are out there.
1301	2	a	A suitably fun and entertaining hero for a new generation.
1302	3	a	This is the classic ugly duckling fable retold for our generation and given a different and imaginative development.
1303	8	a	David Spade has never had a hit film on his own, and he has given us little reason to think he deserves one.
1304	6	a	This is truly a story I'd rather go to the library and read then watch again.
1305	3	a	The film is modest but skillful and heartfelt, spiced just so by Plaza and company.
1306	5	a	I'm afraid the stars' vacation videos are probably more interesting than this poorly handled mistaken-identity caper, which isn't funny enough to be a comedy or dramatic enough to be a thriller. 
1307	1	a	Dern's portrayal of Woody takes on new shades, and its impossible not to warm up to him, just as the emotional resonance of his story sneaks up on you. 
1308	4	a	It benefits from a willingness to move gently through its ethereal dream, mindfully accepting that quiet can be just as enticing to children as bright colors and rapid-fire gags.
1309	3	a	Yes, it does have some 'deep' messages to deliver, but Ghost Dog is also very entertaining.
1310	3	a	For those cinephiles who go weak at the knees for tortured artists and decadents, it's movie heaven.
1311	4	a	Works well as a showcase for Depp's idiosyncrasies.
1312	4	a	Pauly Shore's finest hour.
1313	9	a	These scenes flow like treacle and then the movie really slows down.
1314	4	a	With such acting talent and some of the creators of much better films, you may be expecting more than a good farce. However, the farce is pretty much what you're getting here.
1315	3	a	Japanese melodrama Our Little Sister is the rare film that captures the everyday pleasures and anguishes of family life.
1316	2	a	Though conventionally filmed in a chronological fashion, this could be the most energetic movie this year.
1317	6	a	"Ironically for a movie about people who eat, drink and breathe marketing, ""The Joneses"" is too much of a soft sell to close the deal."
1318	4	a	Michael Fassbender and Alicia Vikander couldn't be more picture perfect in this romantic melodrama.
1319	6	a	The movie feels creaky and anachronistic.
1320	3	a	Super-dog adventure is fun, age-appropriate for kids.
1321	9	a	A cheesy riff on the 'Rosemary's Baby' and 'Omen' template, deserving of nothing more than rotation on the SyFy and Chiller networks.
1322	0	a	Fight Club is still today a definitive film, a statement as strong as any rock anthem and twice as packed with power chords.
1323	9	a	Eventually, it lumbers to an entirely predictable conclusion but never manages a feat of black magic that would convert it from ham-fisted clunker to guilty pleasure.
1324	8	a	Bad directions are the least of its problems.
1325	6	a	The protagonists of this film certainly deserved a better fate.
1326	4	a	Not up to the first one, but watchable.
1327	5	a	Another adaptation of a young-adult novel that seems more concerned with its sequels than itself...
1328	4	a	Do I think The Imitation Game is among the year's best films? Absolutely not, but that should not be held against the film that is, warts and all, an intelligent and mostly entertaining historical drama.
1329	4	a	Laurel Canyon telegraphs far too much of its unoriginal story to genuinely hold our interest. We find ourselves wishing we could leave these characters nattering in the living room and wander around the house looking at the souvenirs and photographs. We'r
1330	3	a	Hoffman's actorly sensibility allows the film's best moments, expressed in gestures and non-verbal signifiers...
1331	4	a	A silly good time.
1332	3	a	Apatow has a gift for earthy, snarky humor and for making heroes of the lamest of doofuses. His wit is sharp, his feel for a wide range of characters is deep, and his ability to coax random hilarity out of an improvising cast is precious and rare.
1333	4	a	The movie aggressively pushes its whimsicality to the point where it feels less whimsical than just aggressive.
1334	8	a	A big, sloppy, loud, grating mess of a movie.
1335	3	a	The push and pull of this movie is really between the lead character and the audience. One moment we feel compassionate: he wants to do the right thing. The next moment he's gone down the cover-up rabbit hole and is an irredeemable swine.
1336	2	a	Meet the Fockers is not a movie for the ages; it's a movie for a few good laughs.
1337	0	a	Probably the best and the richest film by Ridley Scott. But what makes it so powerful? Well, here we go. [Full review in Portuguese.]
1338	6	a	This is, in fact, quite an ugly film.
1339	3	a	The story is surefire, like a good Swiss Family Robinson episode revised for a boys' issue of Aviation Week.
1340	3	a	What starts as a splatter-gun celebration of cyberspace spectacle becomes a savvy, sweet fable of friendship and online distraction, its in-jokes and emotional stakes interwoven with surprising subtlety.
1341	4	a	A throat-slashing, elbow-dropping, grenade-throwing, trigger-pulling, and limb-dismembering good time.
1342	2	a	A lot more fun than most of the director's pompously inflated output.
1343	4	a	The concert footage is excellent, with Brown in decent form, even if in truth he was already a decade past his creative peak. Good music movie, thin documentary.
1344	0	a	A political thriller, sure, but mostly a study in sad, defeated obsession ... and how goddamned cruel the world can be.
1345	3	a	The snappily-edited and uber-efficient working-class caper Logan Lucky is so ephemeral, its screenwriter may not even exist.
1346	4	a	Dirty Harry has mellowed with age, not entirely a bad thing.
1347	3	a	Along with Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind, it's the most playful, intelligent and original comedy of the year.
1348	2	a	Will you be scared? Not really, but you will be made to squirm; not to mention forced to quell that uneasiness deep inside your gut. 
1349	8	a	Well, it was bound to happen: The Wayans brothers have made a movie that's even more two-dimensional than a cartoon.
1350	2	a	There's a lot to like about this offbeat, evocative travelogue.
1351	5	a	takes a potent subtext about the terrors of unprepared parenthood and wastes it in a rote creepy kid flick that displays both iffy internal logic and a trifling execution
1352	4	a	An appealing breeze of the French New Wave blows through the film.
1353	3	a	A lighthearted and entertaining romp.
1354	4	a	It's not half bad, largely because it places an absolute premium on brash, bawdy humor.
1355	1	a	It smashes down the walls of habit that surround so many movies. It returns to the wellsprings. It is a bold, reckless gesture.
1356	9	a	Mostly, the movie is seriously dumb and just a little depressing.
1357	5	a	I'm a big fan of the Coens. But, I've got to say, I'm not much appreciating this picture.
1358	0	a	The unpredictable and fresh 'As Good As It Gets' is peppered with memorable Brooks lines and physical schtick.
1359	6	a	For a film that wants to decry business as usual, Man of the Year seems awfully content to play by the rules.
1360	3	a	Hawke is heart breakingly good in the role of a faltering priest, disillusioned father, and sinner.
1361	2	a	Maybe a little lightweight, but far superior to HBO's THE GIRL. Hopkins, Johansson and especially James D'Arcy are uncanny. Mirren is great. 
1362	6	a	If you're not a fan of naughtiness for naughtiness's sake, Team America is this week's must-miss movie.
1363	3	a	One of the most 'Italian' films I've ever seen; passionate, satirical, and sumptuous
1364	4	a	Beautiful to look at, Zhang Yimou's most recent film from China has a cliched plot and a little too much overripe melodrama.
1365	6	a	For all its flighty charms, The Extra Man never really lands.
1366	4	a	Everything sure is pretty, but I'm not sure this movie has anything to say.
1367	6	a	The relationship between the two stars doesn't grow; it just seems to happen because it was written into the script. It feels contrived as if it was something that moviegoers would expect because the film stars Hanks and Roberts.
1368	9	a	"a paean to ""First World Problems"" "
1369	4	a	It's a juvenile motion picture designed primarily for a juvenile audience. But there's a little more here than one might reasonably expect.
1370	9	a	A tedious stream of nightmarish deja vu.
1371	3	a	An intimate road movie about one family that also lingers on the landscapes and fabric of an old-time, dying vision of the American Midwest
1372	6	a	How the mighty have fallen.
1373	9	a	The movie's idea of big laughs is an extended anal probe joke.
1374	3	a	Lounging around that cabin in a ratty bathrobe, Depp manages to make doing nothing look dynamic.
1375	3	a	Fun Jerry Lewis vehicle, one of his best.
1376	9	a	I Can't Go On, I'll Go On is the name of the bubblegum rock group at the center of Bandslam, as well as a useful mantra for any moviegoer struggling to make it all the way through this depressingly phony approximation of a teen tragicomedy.
1377	4	a	Becoming Jane has its felicities...McAvoy and Hathaway work well together despite being saddled with dialogue that is not remotely in Austen's league. But then again, what is?
1378	9	a	It's hard to get outraged about a movie this bad.
1379	6	a	There's virtually no information about the sport in the movie, which means it has about as much to do with boxing as Christina Aguilera's 'Fighter' does, and it means we have no connection to something that is supposed to be Kallen's passion.
1380	3	a	What separates his film from the numerous what-if examinations of the genre known as post-apocalyptic is a focus on the human condition instead of setting.
1381	3	a	A Most Wanted Man deploys its tangled case of surveillance and counter-intelligence with elegance and grace.
1382	3	a	I was with Sophie's journey right from the start, Claire's quest for a fabled lost romance one that held my heart in the palm of its hand making me care about the outcome far more than it arguably had any right to do.
1383	3	a	An awful screenplay, horrible acting, and all action - fisticuffs, gun fights, car chases, etc. - is badly edited. It's a terrible movie. I loved every cliche-filled minute. 
1384	6	a	Bakshi's filmmaking is sloppy and slapdash at times, to be sure, but it is also uncompromising.
1385	3	a	A rootin' tootin' good time.
1386	7	a	Can we all finally agree that Owen Wilson has jumped the shark?
1387	4	a	All things considered, it probably should have been a whole lot worse.
1388	3	a	Placing his lunatic ensemble of social misfits into a series of episodic story blocks with faultless timing, the director evocatively captures the look, mood, sounds and, most of all, the eccentric attitudes of this alien realm.
1389	2	a	"Do you enjoy diarrhea and screaming? Is your favorite sound effect the ""gooey sploosh?"" Then the heavens have answered all of your prayers."
1390	3	a	The Sting for a new millennium.
1391	4	a	The approach is pretty conventional, but the characters are so brilliant you'd struggle not to be swept up in it all.
1392	4	a	It's mildly funny, mildly dramatic, and well-acted enough.
1393	6	a	[A] mixed bag of a country music comeback fable. 
1394	5	a	Putting the primitive murderer inside a high-tech space station unleashes a Pandora's Box of special effects that run the gamut from cheesy to cheesier to cheesiest.
1395	5	a	Fails to achieve the balance of sharp satire and dramatic heft that Lee was aiming for.
1396	9	a	The film is some sort of humor-deprivation experiment.
1397	9	a	The only vaguely interesting aspect to this film is the subplot involving a past-his-prime Argentinian heavyweight owned by Charlie.
1398	0	a	The American version of The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo is well-made, well-cast, tense and exciting. I just wish I hadn't seen it all before.
1399	9	a	It's worth mentioning for the third time that this movie is much closer to Caligula than Sleepless in Seattle.
1400	1	a	From top to bottom, from the action parts to the talky bits, The Bourne Supremacy is a movie that absolutely flies by with nary an unnecessary breath.
1401	7	a	Woefully creaky and corny.
1402	4	a	Let's not underestimate the significance of a workmanlike Disney animation.
1403	3	a	A smart and well-acted drama that is a refreshing change of pace from this summer's overblown blockbusters.
1404	9	a	Despite the presence of funny guys such as Zahn, Garlin, Justin Long and Jonah Hill, along with veteran character actors Ernest Borgnine, Joe Don Baker and Robert Patrick, the movie fails to be even passably funny.
1405	4	a	His films can be uncomfortably navel-gazing, and that's the case in this somewhat maudlin contemplation of the woes of film-making and the life artistic.
1406	7	a	The Passion of the Christ is so relentlessly focused on the savagery of Jesus' final hours that this film seems to arise less from love than from wrath, and to succeed more in assaulting the spirit than in uplifting it.
1407	5	a	Kids will revel in its bright, dumb fun, even if adults will be disappointed that its terrific ensemble weren't given more to work with.
1408	6	a	[A] schmaltz fest.
1409	0	a	You watch this guy going slowly over the brink and realize, good grief, this is Jimmy Stewart.
1410	0	a	Bird has big shoes to fill - those of Pixar fave John Lassetter - with his latest venture...boy, does he fill them. 
1411	4	a	Rock Dog's optimism and follow-your-dreams themes make it a sure bet for family entertainment.
1412	5	a	A Brick-breaking, glass-shattering, emotion-grabbing first half, stalls, then tailspins into a complete mess. Ending is as bad as the openning is good.
1413	4	a	It's a one-trick pony, but boy, is that trick a thoroughbred.
1414	3	a	Passionate, classical, mysterious and surreal all at once.
1415	1	a	Horribly, wonderfully offensive.
1416	5	a	...far more successful as an actor's showcase than as a fully-realized movie...
1417	4	a	Whatever the film's shortcomings, one thing you can't fault Eastwood for is his unassailable commitment to celebrating American heroism. 
1418	5	a	You know a video-game-based movie is bad when making it look more like a video game is an improvement.
1419	2	a	"Even for its flaws, it is hard to ask for more from a late summer movie than ""The World's End."
1420	7	a	Vote no on Mooseport.
1421	2	a	Gives ample room for the talents of the wonderful Judy Davis.
1422	6	a	The movie is mostly a series of frenetic clashes, dubious near misses and car chases. It lacks the human interest and snowy splendor of the first movie.
1423	1	a	A loving ode to the American wheat belt, told with lashings of candour and wit.
1424	4	a	Bee Movie is a cute movie. Not that there's anything ... well, you know the rest. But cute is not what adults expect from Jerry Seinfeld, although children will be delighted.
1425	5	a	A dour sort-of romantic drama with an A-list cast, a few comic moments and the disjointed sense of talented filmmakers flapping their arms in an effort to make it fly.
1426	4	a	We're asked to believe that John Shooter [Tuturro] is a creative writer...yeah, and I'm a nuclear physicist.
1427	2	a	There are a number of familiar horror tropes here but they intersect in ways you might not expect; it's a rare genre film that successfully surprises its audience, but this one has the potential to do so. 
1428	4	a	Yes, it crosses lines. Yes, it works hard to offend. Yes, it is silly. But you know what? It's also laugh-out-loud funny. And isn't that the point?
1429	1	a	The beauty of My Neighbor Totoro is its simplicity. It's a warm and friendly story that just made me feel good after watching it.
1430	5	a	A loud and truly pointless action-comedy.
1431	5	a	Mars may need moms, but does Earth need this movie?
1432	1	a	With a smart, perceptive script from first-time director Kelly Fremon Craig and an arresting lead performance by Hailee Steinfeld, the film rises to the top of a crowded genre.
1433	6	a	The Predator guts and slashes its way to gory sci-fi mediocrity, but is further failed by abysmal pacing that loses characters, subplots and interest along the way.
1434	5	a	Why must film-makers always be such slaves to the lowest common denominator?
1435	6	a	It's unfortunate that his cinematic life is told with a collage of such static, uninvolving devices as scrapbook photos, journal entries, stock footage and oft-seen MTV interviews.
1436	4	a	Lawrence [has] rarely been more appealing. That's partly because this latest incarnation of his usual persona is more vulnerable and likeable, but mostly it's a relief not to see him strain so hard to Bogart all the jokes.
1437	6	a	There's nothing offensive or repellent about this admittedly acceptable film for kids, [but] there's also nothing enthralling in it . . . 
1438	3	a	This is a date movie that caters to the needs of both men and women: American football and comedy, ballroom dancing and romance. Silver Linings Playbook covers all those bases -- and rises above them too.
1439	6	a	Schneidermeister... Makin' a fool of himself... Losin' his fan base...
1440	5	a	... a self-indulgent, annoying and mostly boring movie.
1441	3	a	Julianne Moore's Oscar clip will likely be an instance of high drama. But she's at her best during the still moments in between.
1442	1	a	Visually arresting and consistently compelling, this movie is magical.
1443	5	a	A misfiring black comedy.
1444	2	a	The film serves as a reminder that no matter how dire the circumstances, truly remarkable change is possible.
1445	2	a	You probably wouldn't want Dupree as a long-term houseguest but in small doses his 'ness' is kinda fun.
1446	4	a	Typical yet frequently goofy fun Ernest flick.
1447	5	a	Special mention must be made of Bryce Dallas Howard, who takes a swing at the Manic Pixie Dream Girl role and hits a stand-up double; it's not exactly a good performance, but it briefly energizes a moribund movie. 
1448	7	a	'Well, that was the longest video game trailer I have ever seen. No, seriously, are you going to show the real film now?'
1449	4	a	Nerds and gamers are more than simply white men of a certain age, guys. Give us all characters we can enjoy and embrace.
1450	8	a	Shot from one of the worst scripts to make it to the big screen in recent memory, it represents the sludge at the bottom of the Hollywood barrel.
1451	3	a	There is some wonderful music by Carly Simon and this pleasant outing is perfect for the kiddies.
1452	0	a	Conveys the melancholy of loss, mortality, and future-shock anxiety, while at the same time leaving us plenty of space to enjoy one of the most complexly unhinged villains in Bond history.
1453	5	a	Two Weeks Notice will find its audience of middle-class women infatuated with the Pretty Woman fantasy of Richie Rich finding the needle of gold in the dishevelled haystack.
1454	4	a	The movie is the anti-Independence Day; the aliens are kicking our butts and we can't do anything but wait for our turn to become kibble.
1455	3	a	There isn't a dull or dumb moment in this movie.
1456	2	a	Have you ever wondered what mumblecore sci-fi would look like? Wonder no more.
1457	6	a	Maybe I'm being a little harsh on this movie, because there are a couple of funny scenes here and there, but they are so outweighed by the ones that bored me silly, they're not the ones that I remember.
1458	3	a	As long as the movie refuses to commit itself, it is a truly creepy, nerve-jangling experience.
1459	2	a	The film remains in a nice and tender adventure, with enough charm to keep our attention, especially those who remember with love the Pooh Bear and his gang of plush animals. [Full Review in Spanish]
1460	4	a	The Green Hornet is a disjointed jumble of gag laughs, goofy stunts, and bizzare casting.
1461	6	a	The film's worth seeing for Charlize Theorn's stunning performance, based on complete physical and psychological transformation, but as a dramatic feature, it lacks an interesting perspective and is underpopulated in terms of characters.
1462	4	a	This one's clunky title - an in-joke referring to the Terminator movies - isn't an especially auspicious start. But, otherwise, Boyle pretty much nails it.
1463	4	a	Things are jollied along by some very stiff acting, especially from Dillon. The film, shot in crisp widescreen, is surprisingly pleasant to look at. It is also surprisingly restrained.
1464	5	a	We never actually see the cannibals eat anybody, which leaves me to wonder: Are they really cannibals, or just slightly carnivorous pack rats? We may never know the answer and we will probably never care. Completely forgettable.
1465	2	a	This is isn't an earth-shaking new drama, but there's enough here to keep a sympathetic Anglophile interested in a modern story about love, loss and redemption all the way across the pond.
1466	6	a	... this odd tale about obsessive Victorian-era magicians and their blood feud isn't nearly as enchanting as it should be.
1467	6	a	By the time O'Neal gets around to intoning the famous tag line, you'll be so sick of hearing Francis Lai's love theme that you'll want to strangle the projectionist.
1468	2	a	You won't be blown away but if it's your thing, you will be entertained.
1469	9	a	A CGI-laced action movie cum merchandising opportunity, warped into insensate silliness by the pop-iconic demands of Smith's megabucks macho action-hero persona and peppered with stock cop-on-the- edge action-movie situations.
1470	4	a	Basically, the movie is an old-fashioned morality play, for all its lurid details.
1471	5	a	It's a standard Western revenge tale dressed up with supernatural elements.
1472	6	a	Someone decided to turn what could have been a fierce safari into a meager fairground. [Full review in Spanish]
1473	6	a	Based on an early Tarantino script, Rodriguez' movie is an incoherent B-pic, in which the sensibilities of the two filmmakers clash.
1474	10	a	What I find so jarring about The Light Between Oceans isn't just its unabashed sentimentality, but its utter reducibility.
1475	3	a	The revelation here... is Alison Lohman... [Y]ou will be amazed by the depths of this talented young woman.
1476	2	a	With such a large cast there's not a whole heck of a lot for everybody to do, but the characters are fleshed out well enough by the writing and the talented ensemble cast.
1477	6	a	Gwyneth Paltrow is a beautiful, gifted actress with a lovely singing voice, but she's never been more miscast than she is in Country Strong.
1478	6	a	While the movie is on target in terms of noble intent, so much about Yentl is self defeating, and the legendary ego of Streisand can safely be deemed the culprit.
1479	5	a	If slasher movies are your thing, take a stab at this one.
1480	10	a	The theft of identity that's going on here is the fact this thing is falsely advertising itself as a comedy
1481	9	a	The film, blah from start to finish, is more likely to sour fond memories than shake off old associations.
1482	9	a	"Maybe the people who made that upcoming ""Cloverfield"" project will have enough time to do reshoots to return itself to its original standalone status so that it can avoid the taint of this sucker."
1483	4	a	The film lacks the anarchic weirdness of some of his best, and without the camp elements it becomes obvious just how like a telenovela the goings-on are.
1484	3	a	There is a lot of laughter and a lot of pathos in Hello, My Name Is Doris. Sally Field delivers one of the finest performances of her career. 
1485	2	a	Eubank is not strong on literal explanations - or on the science underpinning his story. He is an impressionist, alert to the waves of nostalgia that can be unleashed by a single visual metaphor.
1486	4	a	Newcomer [Pierre] Boulanger is as natural and endearing as can be. His Moses is a dancing, laughing, mirror-checking, girl-crazy teen whose difficult family circumstances leave him vulnerable.
1487	3	a	Rated S, for Soulful.
1488	2	a	The experience can be heady and delirium-provoking, but hey, that's cinema for you.
1489	4	a	I was surprised to find The Santa Clause rather easier to take than anticipated.
1490	0	a	Sturges turns upside down the conventions of Hollywood's small-town film: His characters' eccentricity is meant to show the more multifarious and resourceful nature of folks who appear to be bland and ordinary.
1491	4	a	It may creep some people out -- parents more than children, no doubt.
1492	4	a	It's a small story about Woodstock. I didn't think that was possible. Lee's got the look down, but the story doesn't totally captivate, and the music is almost not present.
1493	6	a	Even if it doesn't make you laugh, the movie executives will, all the way to the bank.
1494	2	a	As a story about political change, it's fascinating. And as an Eastwood film, it's perhaps less than we have come to expect.
1495	9	a	There's no payoff as things drag along to a ludicrous ending that reeks of contempt for its audience.
1496	4	a	Without Fey, Whiskey Tango Foxtrot would be a dull show.
1497	5	a	This movie exists as an action showcase, and a fairly lame one at that.
1498	3	a	Close's performance as this poor, wounded fellow resonates with depth and poignancy.
1499	4	a	Roth treats his viewers as smart children, versed in movie logic: they can tell the house is magic, and he doesn't waste their time.
1500	7	a	'Inherent Vice' is a forlorn misfire in all respects.
1501	0	a	When the credits began to roll at the press screening, some critics rose to their feet and just stared dumbly at the screen. I'm happy to admit I was among them.
1502	3	a	Utilizing a lovely British accent and a graceful way with words, Hathaway communicates Austen's predicament beautifully. When she was creating her immortal heroines... the real Jane Austen must have pictured someone like Hathaway.
1503	5	a	Too episodic to be coherent drama, too silly to be taken seriously and too long by far, this is the rare example of Japanese anime that seems singularly lacking in inspiration.
1504	6	a	Perhaps I expected too much, but I was disappointed in Todd Haynes' tasteful, yet tedious, lesbian melodrama, finding it furtive, overly fetishistic and formalized.
1505	3	a	Coming on like Stand by Me meets Son of Rambow, the boys' adventure is essentially dreamy indie-teen wish-fulfilment.
1506	5	a	An overly cutesy, ludicrously anthropomorphic critter feature, even if it is in a good cause.
1507	2	a	None of the jokes are forced, which makes Meet the Parents a singular achievement.
1508	5	a	Sci-fi rehash, which is more interested in video-game-style violence and a high body count than exploring cool story possibilities or preventing plot inconsistencies.
1509	3	a	One of Cholodenko's strengths here is in her casting, particularly that of McDormand and Nivola.
1510	2	a	The look of love [Grant] gives co-star Irene Dunne, captured not in a close-up but a medium-wide shot, could melt anyone.
1511	2	a	...while hardly a world-beating movie, it is certainly worth a look, if only for its atmosphere and, well, its look.
1512	6	a	Secondhand Lions is made from a child's perspective, but its point of view has a glass eye.
1513	6	a	Is it really that bad? No, instead it's that indifferent, which is somehow more distressing.
1514	4	a	There's nothing wrong with a film saving the best for last, but it still must be entertaining while you're waiting. The Way Back comes a little too close to missing that mark.
1515	3	a	The Prestige is a superb puzzle-box thriller.
1516	5	a	...plays like a hollow and manipulative gimmicky Lifetime channel television movie. Alertly, one should decline the cheeky invitation to this senseless ceremonial event
1517	3	a	Enchanted is a sweet romantic fable, with some loveable performances and some genuine good humour.
1518	6	a	It's not a TV remake, with pooches playing the parts made famous by James Brolin, Anne Baxter, and Connie Sellecca. Damn.
1519	9	a	Trust me, a sloppily-edited, unmanageable insult to the intelligence with far too many shortcomings to deserve any further analysis.
1520	4	a	All the style cannot make up for the flagging energy level of the narrative.
1521	5	a	An inside joke rather than a funny one.
1522	1	a	With stunning cinematography from Roger Deakins, a stirring music score by Thomas Newman and another charismatic villain from Bardem, SKYFALL ranks as one of the best Bonds yet.
1523	3	a	John Sayles might be examining quirks in legal and political systems, but he's still capable of making seemingly arcane subject matter engrossing and occasionally moving.
1524	8	a	crap that is fondly remembered and best left at that. 
1525	1	a	As good as Cheadle and Elijofor are, the person I enjoyed most was Taraji P. Henson whose flamboyant performance dominates every scene in which she appears.
1526	3	a	Hereafter, set to a resonant Eastwood score, truly is haunting.
1527	3	a	Ocean's Eleven by way of Ricky Bobby. 
1528	4	a	While the last act of the film is kind of forced, most of it is just perfect.
1529	6	a	Once the travelogue novelty of the posh locations and fine cuisine wears off--which is quickly, if not almost immediately--this slog feels like it is unfolding in real, interminable time.
1530	2	a	As satire, American Dreamz is heavy-handed. As comedy, American Dreamz is hilarious.
1531	4	a	It's not Altman, but its heart is in the right place and Drameh impresses.
1532	2	a	You can certainly see what Disney wants you to come away with from this experience: You are never fully grown up, and you must only listen to your heart... but here, it becomes particularly galling. 
1533	3	a	Ineffable, hilarious, and true.
1534	9	a	Brash, annoying juvenile slapstick comedy...Once word gets around, these Minors probably won't be as much unaccompanied as unattended.
1535	2	a	There is no need to oversell Taking Woodstock. Even though it is based on reality, it is meant as a modest allegory about the search for innocence and understanding and peace and love and so on.
1536	6	a	A predictable, by-the-numbers action flick with a little psychobabble thrown in to the mix.
1537	1	a	Theron gets so deep into the role that it takes our breath away, and not just because of her shocking physical transformation.
1538	5	a	McConaughey's fun to watch, the dragons are okay, not much fire in the script.
1539	6	a	If Cadillac Records had a theme song, it would be Zeppelin's 'Communication Breakdown' or House of Pain's 'Jump Around.'
1540	0	a	The elastic structure provides ample room for inspired surrealism, yet the looseness never compromises the film's tongue-in-cheek love letter to pre-gentrification Manhattan or its piercing satire of Reaganite go-getting ...
1541	6	a	One wonders if an added character named Sleeperman would consider joining the crew because then this simplistic sci-fi dud could have been dubbed as Fantastic Snore
1542	3	a	The plot is a solid one. There are several twists and, although the final villains are known early in the film, it keeps you guessing as to how the end will play out. Helping the plot is a strong cast that gives great performances.
1543	9	a	full review at Movies for the Masses
1544	9	a	The film knocks itself unconscious trying to be whimsical and offbeat, but is so contrived that it is as embarrassing as it is unfunny.
1545	4	a	The first half of this drama is slow and awkward, mainly due to the stars' amateurish acting; but once it finally gets going, Eastwood's skilled touch reveals itself. 
1546	3	a	Lying is an ugly, grubby business, which is why hair maintenance amongst con artists is so important.
1547	9	a	Actors such as Michael Clarke Duncan, Mo'Nique, Mike Epps and Cedric the Entertainer have been persuaded by writer-director Malcolm D. Lee to do crass routines that should have gone out with minstrel shows.
1548	6	a	The film itself feels uncertain, compromised and tentative. Those are very different qualities than brash, or bracing, or provocative.
1549	4	a	Everyone does a jolly good job, including X-Men director Bryan Singer, as the conspiracy plot offers adequate tension and bores sturdily onwards.
1550	6	a	Though mostly a leaden affair, it has its few diversionary magical moments.
1551	1	a	Caustic fun.
1552	1	a	Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri is quite a show and the best evidence yet that someone, somewhere, should erect a statue of Frances McDormand
1553	1	a	Perhaps the weirdest aspect of the movie is that, after a while, the puppets start to feel like real action movie characters.
1554	5	a	Uneven, tasteless and just not all that funny, 'Welcome Home Roscoe Jenkins' is another non-stellar vehicle for Martin Lawrence.
1555	3	a	The small town of Ebbing has been ebbing - losing jobs, hope, citizens and a semblance of small town safety. Yet, beneath the scabs of resentment and violent loss, McDonagh and co. reveal the fresh pink skin of survival and healing: A billboard of hope...
1556	4	a	...an incredibly brutal and pretentious film ostensibly about alienation in a modern desensitized world, a black comedy that entertains only on the most superficial level.
1557	4	a	True, some of these scenes seem to defy the laws of physics, but who cares when the special effects are this good?
1558	7	a	This might work on video while imbibing illegal drugs, however, as it stands...Don't bother.
1559	5	a	What these kids really need for Christmas is acting lessons.
1560	4	a	The magic of the books seems to be having trouble making the transition to big screen.
1561	2	a	After approximately fifteen minutes into the film, however, I forgot about the accent and realized that Anne's exuberance and dramatic range are fitting for this portrayal of the celebrated literary figure.
1562	4	a	The fact that the hamster steals the film speaks volumes about the lack of fresh ingredients.
1563	6	a	Tries way too hard to be cute.
1564	3	a	What delights is the interaction between Jordan and our favorite cartoon characters. Appearances by Larry Bird and Bill Murray add nice touches, too.
1565	0	a	First rate all the way.
1566	7	a	The film seemed to want to put too much suspense and mystery into a story that just didn't have it; but I'll never complain for too long about being able to believe I'm actually watching Alfred Hitchcock at work.
1567	2	a	Pixar does it again with a comedy/action film about a family of superheroes. The writing is the real attraction. THE INCREDIBLES is subversive, heart-warming, and fun.
1568	4	a	You come out knowing you have seen some great performances, brilliant direction and beautiful cinematography, but it is just not a film you love.
1569	9	a	a supremely distasteful piece of work that squanders time, talent, and one of the more eccentric literary legacies
1570	3	a	American Pastoral is as powerful as any movie that uses war as a catalyst for the story. It shows that emotional scars can be created in a myriad of ways.
1571	3	a	The Man With No Name faces a whole lot of pain in Clint's thrilling directorial debut.
1572	3	a	"...clearly Payne's oeuvre, another road movie and a kin of Payne's superior ""About Schmidt."" This time a son discovers his father rather than the father finding himself while women continue to be the sexual aggressors."
1573	2	a	Depends on your tolerance for some very ... uh ... juicy deaths and flying viscera. Face it, you're not watching this for deep meaning.
1574	3	a	This movie should be of great interest to Cubaphiles, music fans, cultural historians and anyone with eyes, ears and a pulse.
1575	5	a	A limp, uninspired dramedy that can never figure out what it wants to be about.
1576	3	a	The level of detail is awe-inspiring, and originality and charm oozes from every pixel.
1577	0	a	Wickedly funny salacious black comedy.
1578	1	a	A class act and a heck of a lot of fun.
1579	4	a	the first part of the movie is so good--so knowing and funny and raucous and even bittersweet in its depiction of male arrested development--that all the sci-fi silliness that runs rampant in the second part feels derivative and unnecessary
1580	4	a	It's simultaneously tightly ordered and awfully cluttered.
1581	2	a	The Coen brothers are among the most eclectic filmmakers around.
1582	6	a	It's all so manipulative that the stakes play as though a game. You can say his emotions destroyed him, but without onscreen evidence it's a hollow sentiment.
1583	2	a	in this hodge-podge of creativity, this kinky mess, there is unbridled zest and an almost innocent sense of joy
1584	8	a	Kate complains about being an immortal, grousing about 'the endless, numbing sameness of it all.' I know how she feels.
1585	1	a	If you want to hate on Judd Apatow's Knocked Up -- and the anti-crowd-pleaser contingent will surely ding it -- then get ready to be drowned out by the sound of laughter from the rest of us.
1586	1	a	An encouraging push in the right direction for cinema which can be equally absorbing and entertaining.
1587	4	a	Brooks' latest grown-up comedy -- as glossy as it appears, as gracefully as it unfolds, as charming as its impressive, all-star cast often is -- arrives as a mild misfire. 
1588	0	a	Crisply well-crafted and beautifully acted.
1589	3	a	Surprisingly dark for a blockbuster and delivers handsomely in terms of thrills and special effects.
1590	4	a	Heavy-handed tearjerker about faith, death, and friendship.
1591	6	a	Aided by largely credible special effects, the four stars of Fantastic Four manage to make their movie worth seeing and give us reason to be optimistic for a more cohesive sequel.
1592	3	a	I went to see Agora expecting an epic with swords, sandals and sex. I found swords and sandals, some unexpected opinions about sex, and a great deal more.
1593	4	a	Its sense of adventure is a minor saving grace in a flawed movie
1594	4	a	The overall mood is safe rather than edgy, but what it does do very effectively is capture a particular quality of adolescent yearning... and Cara Delevingne's puckish charisma is perfect.
1595	1	a	A painfully realistic portrait of a tragedy that is too often viewed through a political prism.
1596	5	a	Pop quiz: What's worse than a disaster flick? Answer: A remake of a disaster flick.
1597	1	a	Silver Linings Playbook isn't perfect - the ending is untidy - but it may just be the year's best comedy.
1598	4	a	If Redford had left out a few of the waffling, undecided characters and drawn his dramatic lines more strongly, the film might have been a lot more powerful.
1599	0	a	gripping and gorgeous
1600	6	a	If there's one thing certain in this new instalment of Jurassic Park, it's that the critters are a whole lot smarter, faster and interesting than the Homo sapiens dropping in on them.
1601	3	a	Such a lyrical, moving independent film is a rare thing to find; Songcatcher is gorgeously made, perfectly cast and thoroughly engaging.
1602	3	a	There is such compositional flair here.
1603	3	a	There's nary a big surprise, but I defy anyone who sees this film to leave without a warm feeling.
1604	1	a	A must see movie for any fan of classic Hollywood.
1605	4	a	The film is so severe, so dramatic in its portrait of suffering youth that it starts to asphyxiate the audience.
1606	4	a	Coppola's directorial debut is an incredibly layered and stylistic film that, despite a fairly slow paced, almost humdrum approach to character development, still manages at least a decent attempt at meaningful cinema.
1607	5	a	Big dull drag of a movie.
1608	6	a	Becoming Jane is one of those perfectly charming and well put together motion pictures I desperately want to like more than I actually do.
1609	4	a	If this proves to be a transitional film, let it be as an introduction to an agent who comes back with his sense of humor intact. 
1610	2	a	...an honest attempt to explore the single greatest mystery of life...with intelligence, open-mindedness, understanding, and compassion.
1611	9	a	Meet the Spartans can't even get its fart jokes right. How incredibly sad is that?
1612	1	a	Oskar's story touches on so many facets of life it's hard to know where to start analyzing.
1613	4	a	The problem is, the humour of the material does not combine as well as it should with the filmmaking style. The method is absurdist, and so are the characters, and there's nothing straight to play off.
1614	4	a	There's not much to like or dislike in this ride; it's the kind of all-season, live-action amusement that the Disney studio has been churning out for decades.
1615	3	a	Fun and entertaining -- a good time. 
1616	10	a	One of the worst movies that has ever been conceived. I loathed and despised absolutely every pathetic second of it.
1617	7	a	Although it strives for bigger things, Albert Nobbs proves itself to be a diluted and bland exploration into transgender survival in conservative Ireland, headlined by Glenn Close's vain gender bending performance.
1618	5	a	Russell should probably be applauded for trying something different, but I Heart Huckabees often seems weird for weirdness' sake.
1619	7	a	Utterly intolerable with its indulgence in inner-city stereotypes, overt preaching and simple antidotes.
1620	6	a	Has the consistency of an individually wrapped slice of Velveeta.
1621	5	a	[A] disjointed drama filled with one-dimensional characters and melodrama so Lifetime movie-esque that it careens into unintentional comedy.
1622	6	a	Uninspired.
1623	5	a	Underwhelming alien comedy has some suggestive humor.
1624	6	a	The reliability of the genre doesn't excuse predictable jokes, pat fiascoes and so many stereotypes that one is tempted to alert the Greek anti-defamation league.
1625	5	a	Sadly, filmmaker Erik Gandini misses an opportunity ... in this documentary that sets out to explore the links between Berlusconi's business interests and his political standing.
1626	9	a	I say from some experience that there's a lot to recommend in a good ol' game of Dungeons and Dragons, especially if you have a little imagination. There's absolutely no reason to sit down and watch someone else do it, though.
1627	8	a	I would say that chaos ensues, but it started the minute the opening credits started to roll, so 'ensuing' is not very helpful. Chaos reigns.
1628	4	a	What makes Grahame's story eminently watchable, and even fascinating in spurts, is the magnetic performance by Annette Bening, who always seems to shine right around awards season. 
1629	2	a	With a dream cast of the youngest and brightest actors of the day, Cassavetes creates a movie that feels like you're watching an apathetic group of kids riding down a progressively steeper incline in an unmanned vehicle.
1630	5	a	This had potential to be something of an action thrill ride, or at least a comedic, campy take on the usual superhero formula, but what we end up with is a directionless, pointless backdrop for blowing things up with some martial arts thrown in for kicks.
1631	3	a	Watching Amy Adams exude her comical charm is alone worth the price of admission.
1632	4	a	Damien-Omen II though it's as foolish as the first film, is rather more fun to watch and sometimes very stylish-looking.
1633	3	a	It's colorization in sheep's clothing--don't you be duped into thinking otherwise.
1634	0	a	Russell's unerring ability to take the careworn components of a story and fashion them into something unique and poignant reaches its peak with an exuberant caper that satisfies across the board - from love story to switch-backing crime yarn.
1635	7	a	"The new third entry in the series isn't interested in character development or logical storylines or anything resembling innovation. It's lazy and limp and profoundly weird, and not in any meaningful way a ""good movie."
1636	5	a	In this highly superheroic summer of Iron Man and the forthcoming The Dark Knight, Hancock can offer only an A-list headliner in a D-list project.
1637	3	a	No, it's not as good as the original, but that doesn't mean you can't enjoy it.
1638	4	a	Yet another faithful adaptation...
1639	0	a	The engrossing true-life drama of an idealistic young man who yearns to live alone in the Alaskan wilderness and to reap the soulful benefits of solitude in the spirit of Thoreau.
1640	1	a	"The film about atypical artistic pursuits in a blue-collar community that ""The Full Monty"" sought to be. Peter Darling's choreography dexterously captures the defiance in the dancing - rage against economical and emotional repression in a motherless home."
1641	6	a	The computer animation is phenomenal and there are certain moments when it is very evident that this idea had potential but ultimately the lack of depth, the dreariness and the snail-like pace stripped the experience of a lot of its magic. 
1642	4	a	More sizzle than onion rings
1643	1	a	Sometimes the experience of seeing a film so powerful in its presentation of human character is worth the arguable sacrifice of narrative tension
1644	3	a	Despite its overused plotline, the film works. It exudes charm. It makes you laugh at the silliest things.
1645	6	a	Fans of Smith's first film will appreciate Mallrats for its combination of the same type of humor and many of the same actors from Smith's acclaimed debut.
1646	6	a	Aside from the laughs, it's not offering much in terms of thrills and originality.
1647	5	a	Given the choice between the humans in this movie and the dragons, I'm rooting for the cockroaches.
1648	4	a	Director Cassevetes has a bit more than he can handle with this complex telling of a real-life tragedy, but he elicits believable performances from the young cast, with Justin Timberlake especially impressive as Johnny's tough-guy-with-a-heart lieutenant.
1649	3	a	This is a good, old-fashioned family movie grounded in Matt Damon's best-ever performance.
1650	6	a	This sketch of John Holmes only shows a part of his world. And to reduce him to one part -- well, that's to only continue the treatment he got his entire adult life.
1651	1	a	A neon-colored, sun-baked fantasia that's part Western spoof and part surrealist jag through the desert with Johnny Depp as our theatrically unhinged, reptilian tour guide, Rango is anything but your standard kiddie animated flick.
1652	3	a	A rare and intriguing example of theological inquiry in American cinema ... driven by an aching conscience.
1653	3	a	Sayles . . . can keep the politics front and center while still maintaining a fierce humanity at the core
1654	4	a	It's buoyantly paced, and has just enough sincerity about its feathered society to keep you from sneaking glances down at WhatsApp.
1655	4	a	Unfortunately, Albert is so good at being unobtrusive, he nearly disappears from his own story, making it hard for us to get invested in it.
1656	9	a	what night's rubbish night again?
1657	0	a	The Artist is a rarity, an ingenious crowd-pleaser.
1658	5	a	Its heart may be in the right place but the film's script lacks the nuance and subtlety that could really elevate this drama.
1659	0	a	An enduring masterpiece...Truffaut's autobiographical fiction shows an admirable equanimity by depicting the highs and lows of boyhood. [Blu-ray]
1660	5	a	Viewers who will find the most to appreciate here are men in the winter of white male discontent.
1661	4	a	Love [Jude Law] and you'll love - or at least enjoy - the movie. Feel so-so about Law and the movie falls flat on its face.
1662	1	a	You find yourself reliving many of your family reunions while watching this comedy, many of us having suffered through the same troubles.
1663	3	a	Parker-Stone fans are likely to have a grand time.
1664	4	a	It probably goes without saying, but tissues are a must.
1665	5	a	A fun, colorful and action-packed sequel that doesn't quite pass the 'Does this movie need to exist?' test.
1666	9	a	[A] crass, shallow cash-in.
1667	7	a	Stereotypes and contrived shenanigans don't seem to actually offer much catharsis for harried moms seeking escape. And the dads inevitably butt into their me-time.
1668	4	a	There is not another performer like [Aubrey Plaza] on the scene. 
1669	3	a	Sam Mendes has created an intelligent, thoroughly engrossing, beautifully acted adaptation of a classic novel that depicts the tragic underside of America's sunniest decade.
1670	4	a	Alas, Coffee and Cigarettes is more fun to reminisce about afterwards than it is to endure.
1671	5	a	The problem is that for most of the running time, How Do You Know meanders and has a hard time finding the right tone, lurching forward from one scene to the next.
1672	3	a	Huge in scope and endlessly exciting, Gladiator is the new word in blockbuster.
1673	4	a	There isn't a malicious bone in the film's body.
1674	0	a	It should be unwatchable. But in the sure hands of America's most effervescent humanist director, David O. Russell, it's unmissable.
1675	6	a	The movie feels flat and small, lacking the novel's energy and expansive ambition.
1676	3	a	Crowe seems to be making baby steps into new territory, both stylistically and emotionally.
1677	6	a	A little like being on a blind date. Bits of it are charming, much of it is awkward and several sequences plod along with the self-consciousness of a first-date stop-and-start conversation.
1678	6	a	TV comedy king Ray Romano makes his first foray into feature film in a spectacularly unfunny comedy.
1679	4	a	Perfect for a girl's night out.
1680	4	a	Todd Haynes movies tend to grow on me. I expect that Carol, his adaptation of Patricia Highsmith's The Price of Salt, will do the same. 
1681	6	a	Always preposterous though never actually silly, knowingly funny without ever being self-conscious, Fast Five is a passable action flick that will more than entertain its core audience.
1682	5	a	[A] fetid romantic comedy...In short, if it weren't for bad Luck then the chump Chuck wouldn't have any cinematic luck at all.
1683	9	a	[Tyler] seems like she would be more at home playing a tomboy.
1684	3	a	Heathers, with all its flagrant masochism and violence, is a throwback to a more innocent time, where such films could be made and still be deemed over the top fantasy. 
1685	6	a	If the best thing you can say about this adaptation is that the island looks pretty, perhaps we might be better off borrowing a travelogue video from the local library.
1686	5	a	Silent Hill? Nonsenseville, more like.
1687	3	a	Payne has never before been this melancholy, or this sincere. Nebraska looks into America's soul and finds a troubling emptiness.
1688	6	a	Petrie made Grumpy Old Men, which appealed to the same older audience Welcome to Mooseport apparently is going after ... Both films suffer from a flatness and uneven pacing that make them slow going.
1689	0	a	It may not score with a mass audience, but in museums and art centers around the world, it will always be in rotation.
1690	6	a	The movie is shallow and clinical. It rarely lets us inside its protagonists. We know that they despise Hitler, period, and that they consider themselves patriots. ...
1691	4	a	Hollywood has a long history of turning highbrow art into middlebrow mush, and Mao's Last Dancer is just one more kick dancer in that long line.
1692	0	a	The real triumph is that while we are fascinated with the particulars of the story, we feel the shame, awkwardness, fears and cosmic fate that bounce off each character.
1693	5	a	There are plenty of skilled people behind this female-empowerment movie, but the film badly botches its core message.
1694	3	a	For all its flaws, it was classic Bond. And remains so.
1695	6	a	Marred by absurd plot digressions and choppy, sloppy and incoherent shaky-camera action sequences.
1696	2	a	A charming imagining of the adult life of the boy from the Hundred Acre Wood.
1697	3	a	A charming movie that blends comedy, romance and science fiction -- not necessarily the most obvious combination of genres, but one that director Colin Trevorrow and writer Derek Connolly manage with assured ease.
1698	1	a	Perhaps it's a result of all the other roles we've seen this uniquely fearless actress play, on stage and screen, wrapped into one. But you look at her face and you think: This person has a moral compass. Her side is the right one. We will be safe there.
1699	4	a	Entertaining story of fate, alcoholism, and love.
1700	7	a	...the soundtrack sounds like they're doing the same song over and over. The melodies and lyrics apparently change, but to the non-fan they're indistinguishable. 
1701	4	a	Even with a too-cute script, divorcee romantic comedy is passable thanks to the peanut butter/chocolate pairing of Diane Lane and John Cusack.
1702	3	a	With the possible exception of Tommy Lee Jones, no one is better suited to dish out stone-faced, my-way-or-the-highway discipline than Jackson.
1703	1	a	It's not just a terrific Bond movie; it's a terrific movie, period. 
1704	9	a	...original stars Eddie Murphy and Jeff Garlin have wisely chosen to be absent this time around.
1705	0	a	Rio Bravo isn't a Fordian display of vast Western visas; the contours explored here are emotional.
1706	6	a	What About Bob this ain't.
1707	9	a	Families of all ages deserve a lot better than this.
1708	6	a	for a while it works, right up until its dreadfully silly ending
1709	1	a	It's a wonderful film, rich with style and loaded with surprises, with a fluid storytelling touch that brings substance to a genre that's often concerned solely with appearance.
1710	4	a	A stylishly goofy take on the old possessed limb genre...
1711	2	a	"The adapted screenplay by Eric Roth...[uses] his own ""Forrest Gump"" as the outline, gives us a central character who is far too passive and fails to apply the wisdom of age to youth in any profound way."
1712	1	a	Genuinely affecting nature film with spectacular location shots.
1713	2	a	Well intentioned, spectacularly filmed, and packing a vital message, Arctic Tale is worthwhile, even if its old style presentation leaves us less than thrilled.
1714	3	a	The creators of South Park have outdone themselves.
1715	2	a	Hoffman hasn't a lot to say in A Most Wanted Man but with his curt asides and air of casual authority he's always a commanding presence.
1716	0	a	Ballsy and dumb and brilliant all in one bite. You can gobble it up like empty calories, or over-chew each joke.
1717	2	a	...a turgid little melodrama which unfolds with slow, methodical pacing amidst a laconically dismal Southern backdrop.
1718	1	a	Older kids and adults ... will feel rewarded and blessed to have seen something so intriguing.
1719	5	a	Clever premise, witless execution.
1720	4	a	full review in Greek
1721	3	a	You have all the ingredients here of the pernicious id roiling in the secret think-pan of most thoughtful Americans.
1722	0	a	"As rich and strange as we've come to expect from the ""late"" Anderson films, but doesn't quite achieve the digressive whackadoo majesty of the novel."
1723	2	a	Thematically and artistically ambitious and faithful to the source material, Penn's film is not only intriguing but also feels like a more personal work than his former outings.
1724	3	a	Pedro Almodovar reteams with Penelope Cruz, and you have your review right there.
1725	3	a	Writer-director Mike Cahill, who can be a bit too fancy with the camera, delivers a lot of deep-dish philosophizing with a minimum of cant.
1726	5	a	Brushing your teeth is more fun
1727	4	a	Damon brings the proper conviction to his role as [Jason Bourne].
1728	7	a	Yet another in the increasingly inert and generic assembly line created by Adam Sandler for SNL alums.
1729	2	a	The movie's substance lies in its psychological profiles, and it's as twisty and tortuous as any peek into the subconscious is liable to be.
1730	3	a	"This shrugs off the musty restraints of costumed stereotypes and concentrates exclusively on the slowburning affair as Keats finds himself ""dissolving"" as love draws him in."
1731	3	a	A period drama that doesn't rely on heaving bosoms to register passion.
1732	6	a	The movie fails to portray its literarily talented and notorious subject as anything much more than a dirty old man.
1733	4	a	This was a troubled production. Scottish director Lynne Ramsay quit days before shooting began and there were late changes made to the cast. In certain respects, the replacement director Gavin O'Connor has done an impressive job.
1734	5	a	A butchered mess of a movie that only superficially resembles the Elmore Leonard novel on which it's based.
1735	4	a	Eastwood terrorist thriller casts three American heroes to play themselves. They had never acted before and as far as I'm concerned their record is clean, leaving the gripping, complex movie that might have been frustratingly out of reach.
1736	4	a	It's popcorn-chomping fun rooting for the soul-stripped Hex as he battles his way toward redemption and sweet, sweet payback. 
1737	0	a	This isn't a good Woody Allen movie. No, this is one of the great Woody Allen films.
1738	6	a	So oppressively identified with its predecessor's look, sound, and design that Doug Liman warrants a co-director credit.
1739	2	a	Mars Needs Moms is visually inventive and occasionally emotionally potent, but feels overly padded in its attempt to stretch such a short story to feature length.
1740	0	a	Knocked Up never stops being funny, but after a while it eases into a profound commentary about commitment, sacrifice and the life-changing results of one fleeting mistake.
1741	6	a	In the end, Whiskey Tango Foxtrot is too watered-down and formulaic to be what the source material suggests it could have been: a pitch-black surreal comedy on the order of Robert Altman's M.A.S.H.
1742	9	a	Full of contradictory elements, one-note characters, and plot holes.
1743	3	a	A tremendous show of the human spirit, that uses technical magic to heighten its reality and put us in the middle of the action. The end result is nothing short of impressive.
1744	6	a	Style overwhelms substance. By the seventh rewind, the audience has grown understandably weary.
1745	3	a	Sweeping action, solid characters, spectacular scenery, a bountiful sense of cleverness, and a pitch-perfect tone of self-reference to the long line of Bond pop-culture mythology. 
1746	3	a	Any reservations that this is a straight forward remake of Abel Ferrara's hardcore Catholic redemption drama should be left on the wayside, for this Bad Lieutenant is a different monster all together.
1747	4	a	The women in the cast are exceptional. ... The men are miscast.
1748	3	a	This in-reference fest for frightfilm fans has enough chuckles and shudders even for those who've never heard of Nosferatu.
1749	0	a	No Country for Old Men is the most brutal cinematic experience of the year, as well as one the best. It's nothing shy of an unforgettable masterpiece.
1750	6	a	The third act begins with another twist - but this one is so arduous, absurd and out of character for the film that the entire plot, stretching back to Scene One, is sabotaged
1751	0	a	I'm still laughing.
1752	4	a	It is Woodstock light, which is one thing. It is also Ang Lee light, which is another thing altogether and far less satisfying.
1753	9	a	The only funny part of Little Man is the shoddy computer effects that freakishly and unconvincingly put Marlon Wayans' head on a tiny body.
1754	1	a	I'd love to see Aniston receive an Oscar nomination for her performance.
1755	0	a	Howard Hawks stages the definitive cow opera with beautiful, lyrical, exciting sequences of stampeding, rough weather, cowboying and Indian skirmishes.
1756	5	a	One can't help but think that a movie chronicling Ayoub El Khazzani's journey toward that fateful day might be more interesting and useful.
1757	3	a	It's refreshing to see a full-blown, straight-faced, supernatural horror movie in this age of grubby torture flicks being mistaken for the coin of the realm. 
1758	6	a	Contracted goes all-out on the gross-out.
1759	5	a	Time for death to call in sick?
1760	7	a	Rock the Kasbah never wrinkles out its speeches after wrenching them from its pockets, which elicits a jumbled tone that's neither funny nor serious nor coherent.
1761	4	a	[Annette] Bening clearly identifies with Grahme, her nostalgia and pain, and also her will to live. [Full Review in Spanish] 
1762	5	a	The other shame of Anton Corbijn's version of John le Carre's novel is that it's not much good.
1763	4	a	...a frustratingly protracted piece of work that should have been so much better...
1764	4	a	One of those movies that's bad enough to make it worth seeing.
1765	0	a	a Platonic dialogue in that it's suspiciously like a monologue disguised as an exchange.
1766	2	a	The Dressmaker is enormously good fun, especially if you love clothes and enjoy a makeover montage.
1767	2	a	It's all outrageous and patently stereotypical but Brewer and the actors invest these representations with everything they have. It's great to see Jackson working hard here to create a character instead of simply Superflying a bunch of snakes on a plane.
1768	3	a	Succeeds only because Bullock and Grant were made to share the silver screen.
1769	0	a	A lovingly shot, beautifully realized love letter to cinema history.
1770	3	a	Space Jam isn't exactly a slam dunk. It's more of a graceful tip-in by Michael Jordan, with a snazzy assist by Bugs Bunny.
1771	1	a	The best Bond movie in decades.
1772	1	a	A film of integrity and disclosure, a controversial chapter in American history that substitutes clinical accuracy for Hollywood embellishment, with an impressive attention to detail and an admirable respect for suspenseful narrative.
1773	3	a	Bell, as charming and witty as ever, smoothly steps back into the role she was made to play.
1774	5	a	It's almost campy enough to be worthy. Except it's not.
1775	10	a	Do the filmmakers think we're morons? We're certainly treated as such, right from the beginning.
1776	3	a	Perhaps not as good as the first Superman, this one offers more action and laughs a minute.
1777	5	a	Pardon us, Mother Bates, may we borrow your knife?
1778	4	a	James and Smith are terrific together.
1779	1	a	The saga's second coming will hit your head like a beer stein dropped from a pub mezzanine.
1780	5	a	Talented cast can't save mature, disappointing adaptation. 
1781	6	a	Bart the Bear delivers the film's most memorable performance.
1782	3	a	The action begins immediately, without even a title credit, and the movie ends abruptly and almost arbitrarily, as if we have witnessed an almost literal slice of life, snipped off at either end by a pair of editor's shears. Life -- and crime -- goes on.
1783	4	a	"If ""Hitchcock"" ultimately feels inconsequential, it always aims to please, and for the most part, it does."
1784	7	a	Sadly, the level of deviance hovers around iCarly levels, as does the sophistication of the humor.
1785	6	a	Sputters to the end credits on autopilot.
1786	3	a	Dark, brutal and very funny, Fight Club is one of the most mesmerizing films to come along in quite a while.
1787	3	a	Even those who find it overstuffed, opaque and derivative will be bowled over by its sheer pictorial extravagance and visual sheen.
1788	0	a	A sad heartbreaker of a film.
1789	5	a	The bickering back and forth between Foster and Sarsgaard becomes tiresome. And the erriness dissipates without anything as interesting to replace it.
1790	9	a	If you see this on at the cinema, walk on by.
1791	4	a	Clearly not for all viewers, The Grey Zone is a thought-provoking but not quite believably realistic look at yet another saga of WWII era genocide.
1792	3	a	It's apt to leave American viewers with a depressing sense of cultural inferiority when these characters are weighed against the classless, clueless, horny drunks that populate our own equivalents of Klapisch's film.
1793	2	a	A novelty flick that wears out its welcome well before the closing credits...but damn if there's still not a heaping helping of hellacious lunacy to enjoy along the way
1794	4	a	A beautiful-looking but essentially lifeless work that would seem more at home on a mantelpiece than on a movie screen.
1795	4	a	A gruesome, brutally violent and queasy trailer-park nightmare from deep in the heart of Texas.
1796	9	a	The dog had the right idea.
1797	3	a	an enjoyably self-conscious throwback to an earlier era of scary-fun supernatural movies for kids too young to drive
1798	6	a	Today, however, it's hard to watch a film about people who live in a bubble with problems that might earn them a spot on WhiteWhine.com.
1799	4	a	Not Easily Broken isn't perfect, but it is persuasive in its portrait of a husband and wife who must decide whether their frayed marriage is worth fighting to save.
1800	0	a	A cinematic high-wire act that audaciously blends edgy comedy together with genuinely touching drama into one of the most purely and surprisingly entertaining movies of the year.
1801	3	a	Tightly plotted and thematically well-crafted.
1802	9	a	It's like watching the 'we were on a break' episode of Friends stretched to feature length...
1803	0	a	To revisit it now is still to marvel at its wit, audacity and sheer entertainment value.
1804	3	a	...an upbeat confection that boasts a robust celebration in spotlighting the confusion of the indelible heart set against the luscious Barcelona baroque backdrop...gleefully impish
1805	4	a	Black blows up the action movie stereotypes of yore with a Cheshire Cat grin. 
1806	1	a	A confident, quick-witted romantic comedy that is a giddy joy from start to finish.
1807	4	a	Spectacularly scenic but don't expect much more than a frothy diversion, courtesy of cinematographer John Seale.
1808	5	a	"The sequel to group one, only stupider"" is how one soldier describes the squad, in one of the rare self-referential jokes here that actually lands. But owning it doesn't excuse it."
1809	3	a	Sausage Party is so wrong, so go-for-broke insane, existing words aren't enough to describe it. Shockrageous comes close. As does horristurbing.
1810	6	a	"Hudson's singing and Whitaker's acting compensate somewhat, but for a truly inventive and uplifting African-American piece set in New York during the Yuletide season, skip Black Nativity and watch Run-DMC's ""Christmas in Hollis"" music video instead."
1811	5	a	There is one scene that conjures the spirit of the original.
1812	8	a	This Dude, Where's My Sword-time travel mess is funnier than a good many intentional comedies.
1813	4	a	Despite noble intentions and bloody nods to religious intolerance, this historic epic can feel like a drippy toga party
1814	6	a	If I really wanted to indulge in stargazing, I'd just as soon hook up a telescope in the backyard and aim it at the night sky.
1815	3	a	A one-of-a-kind original. Those courageous enough to give it a try will find their efforts rewarded, at times in the most unexpected of ways.
1816	6	a	Jonah Hex is a good performance and a few good lines buried in a script whose authors should do a little time in writer's hell for scribbling it.
1817	3	a	A gratifying early surprise of the autumn movie season, an intelligent and wise film that finds vast entertainment value in one man's own existential crises.
1818	0	a	Sour and funny, Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri is the film that the Coen brothers must somehow just have forgotten to make, when they were at their height.
1819	4	a	A lively but sloppy update for Kato and the Green Hornet.
1820	4	a	Mostly, Roll Bounce provides relatively wholesome family entertainment. And for parents of a certain age, it offers a nice trip down memory lane. At least for those who can stand those memories of themselves wearing all that polyester.
1821	3	a	A meticulous thriller based on a large-scale conspiracy within the German army to assassinate Hitler.
1822	3	a	THE HOBBIT: AN UNEXPECTED JOURNEY is a visual feast with whimsy and charm.
1823	3	a	Midnight in Paris is a welcome addition to the Allen oeuvre, an affectionate love letter to France that'll leave you grinning at its silliness and sweetness from ear to ear.
1824	6	a	Your enjoyment of National Security will be in direct proportion to how much you can tolerate Martin Lawrence's antics.
1825	6	a	Designed to appeal to teenage boys everywhere ... but no matter how much vomit the puppets produce, their actions just aren't funny.
1826	4	a	brings together an exceptionally gifted cast and asks the actors to work wonders with mediocre material. Often they succeed, although not often enough to make the film a must-see...
1827	4	a	At its heart, Menashe is a universal story.
1828	3	a	Arash Amel's excellent screenplay also includes a cogent description of post-traumatic stress disorder.
1829	5	a	... is [Elizabeth] Gilbert really the selfish, shallow, immature narcissist we see here?
1830	6	a	Like so many contemporary movies, The Break-Up doesn't know when to call it quits, and the film finally expires after several false endings.
1831	3	a	With a slew of seemingly random clues unraveling in the pursuit of scientific mystery, Origins becomes gut-punching marvel.
1832	6	a	"The opening and closing moments of ""Midnight in Paris"" are visually resplendent. The movie in the middle gets in the way."
1833	0	a	As fine a look at dislocation as you're ever going to see, and it has the nice bonus of boasting Bill Murray's greatest performance.
1834	3	a	Lyrical and very touching.
1835	3	a	I laugh, I cried, I nearly hurled.
1836	3	a	A better than average comic book effort.
1837	3	a	Rogen may have lost weight for this role, but it hardly matters-he's still doing a more charming version of Butt-Head, aged twentysomething. You know by now if that works for you or not.
1838	3	a	Will likely not go down as one of Cruise's most rewarding moneymakers, though it may become one of his more memorable contributions to the archives.
1839	0	a	Gorgeously shot and utterly absorbing, this is a truly original love story that will leave you speechless.
1840	4	a	A smart and worthy continuation of this comedic battle of the age-groups.
1841	2	a	Surprisingly brusque yet likable.
1842	3	a	utterly charming
1843	4	a	On the surface The Hot Chick
1844	3	a	The performances are casually brilliant... 
1845	7	a	A lot of dull hooey about mankind's search for answers. Mankind's slow, interminable search for answers.
1846	3	a	The Curious Case of Benjamin Button isn't about a man who lives backwards or a woman who lives forwards ... Get past the plot, the pitch, and the technique, and you can see it as a reminder that all we can do is live now.
1847	6	a	Watching Paper Heart isn't a painful process, but it isn't electrifying either.
1848	4	a	The moments when it approaches greatness only make its shortcomings that much more transparent.
1849	0	a	An incisive commentary about the emptiness and rapacity of important people.
1850	4	a	Valkyrie works as a full-dress military drama, fleshing out a historical footnote in vivid detail.
1851	0	a	...a stark, clear-eyed picture of outlaw life in the real wild west.
1852	5	a	A disappointing James Bond thriller.
1853	2	a	Cronenberg is at play in this slippery, surreal affair that is best appreciated with open ears and an open mind -- and begs to be seen twice.
1854	6	a	Holocaust films are problematic, period. The Grey Zone is, sadly, more evidence of the qualities of silence.
1855	2	a	Nakadai's performance as Kagemusha and Shingen is impressive, creating two distinct characters, one of whom eerily mimics the other
1856	5	a	Yes, Paz's story is unique, and you have to admire the insistence in telling it, but Bleed For This can't help but follow the emotional beats that filmmakers, for better and worse, have stuck to in the past.
1857	10	a	I'll never understand how Neil Young won the heart of Jim Jarmusch.
1858	5	a	Just as predictable and contrived as any Hollywood romantic comedy, only without the advantage of amusing comic relief to distract from the thuddingly obvious plotting.
1859	4	a	It's fair to say that Broken Embraces isn't one of Almodovar's best films, but it's still something of an interesting failure and remains worth seeing.
1860	9	a	...a bottom-of-the-barrel comedy that'll probably leave even small children exhausted by its nonstop energy. 
1861	4	a	A thought-provoking thriller and Gothic horror story directed by Pedro Almodovar.
1862	2	a	Although it takes a breezy, sometimes silly approach to a fragment of a true story, this British period film has enough charm to keep audiences entertained...
1863	4	a	Still Alice is accurate and compassionate, and anyone who has known someone with Alzheimer's will appreciate the film's sincere intentions.
1864	5	a	Cassavetes sends us on a slow death march, following his bland, drugged-out and overly tattooed characters from one beer-bong party to the next.
1865	3	a	Souffle light and long on charm, one of Allen's wittiest and certainly his most literary
1866	3	a	Earnest, but only occasionally inspiring and a bit of an overreach, especially in the casting. 
1867	9	a	Four hundred years into the future, human beings can conquer new planets and are still dumb enough to split up when a psycho killer is after them.
1868	8	a	When did feature-length comedies like this one come to settle for indistinguishably 'colorful' characters as a substitute for anything really funny or sharp to say about American daily life?
1869	1	a	The Savages isn't cheery holiday fare, ... and yet Jenkins makes her film unexpectedly uplifting, in a small-scale, real-life kind of way.
1870	3	a	"The sensational Helen Mirren sounds the war cry for all those unappreciated ""plus ones"
1871	2	a	Blood-soaked pop theology for a doom-laden time, its effect that of a gripping yet reductive paradox: It lifts us downward.
1872	5	a	It's not nearly nerdy enough.
1873	6	a	The only thing worse than an Adam Sandler movie is an Adam Sandler movie without Adam Sandler.
1874	0	a	Eastwood's best direction since Unforgiven and arguably the best, most mature work of his career.
1875	3	a	Breathtakingly, beautifully simple.
1876	5	a	You can see the obvious social-political jokes being made, but it's so juvenile.
1877	1	a	One of the most shocking and disturbing films this year, it's hard to rave about a movie that makes you so angry.
1878	7	a	The only thing funny about this pic is Jerry's stilted performance.
1879	0	a	"Going deep without resorting to trick plays, the sure-handed ""Silver Linings Playbook"" scores on every possession."
1880	8	a	Directed with muddled confusion, the movie goes through its stock characters and obligatory plot points without enthusiasm or charm.
1881	3	a	Impressively directed, superbly written drama with career-best performances from both Keira Knightley and Sienna Miller.
1882	6	a	Fosters resentment by tricking you into thinking it's going somewhere much cleverer than it actually does.
1883	6	a	"You could justly apply many adjectives to movies by director Guillermo Del Toro, but ""conventional"" wasn't one of them - until ""Crimson Peak."
1884	5	a	Fey's work is strong, yet it's difficult to squash the impression that this could be a more powerful movie, and an even more significant showcase for Tina Fey.
1885	3	a	Bryan Cranston is once again caught up in the drug world but this time he is 'Breaking' Good in this true story about a Federal Agent going deep undercover - a movie that doesn't let up the tension for a minute.
1886	4	a	The film... assumes such vast prior knowledge of the civil rights movement that only a fraction of the audience will understand it. I scrambled to keep up, not helped by a cast of thousands and by Ava DuVernay's clumsy and flabby direction.
1887	3	a	The latest romp from Nick Park is a clever look at prehistoric soccer.
1888	5	a	Caine looks embarrassed through the entire film, as well he might.
1889	1	a	A movie that demonstrates once again why the studio continues to leave competing product from the likes of Disney and DreamWorks in the dust.
1890	1	a	I've read the books and seen the better Swedish version and still found this interesting and tense, despite the fact that the sex and violence are considerably toned down from the original.
1891	9	a	Focus-grouped to such a precise dot that everyone in the audience will not only be able to name each brand of luggage the characters use, but will do so with joy and pride.
1892	9	a	Deep down, I realized the harsh reality of my situation: I would leave the theater with a lower I.Q. than when I had entered.
1893	0	a	It would be nice to be able to buck the critical orthodoxy and say how tired and overrated Citizen Kane is; but the dulll truth is, it's still, indisputably, one of the great masterpieces of cinema.
1894	5	a	Succumbing to the worst possible scenario for a film like this, I, Frankenstein is a boring and poorly written attempt at establishing the infamous creature as an action icon.
1895	1	a	I would have preferred a bit more resolution, but it's hard to fault the filmmakers for sticking to their filmic style
1896	2	a	Nobody is going to mistake this future noir for Spielberg's Minority Report, but for a light-headed adrenaline rush, it works pretty well.
1897	3	a	Manages to create a haunting virtual world that's more mystical than anything the Wachowski brothers have offered us, blending the real and the imagined into a portentous cyberpunk fable.
1898	3	a	Chan is jumping everywhere, breaking through windows and using whatever he finds as a weapon. So, this ain't his best film, but you can't deny that he's an amazing performer, and the picture remains great entertainment.
1899	5	a	This franchise will never make the history books, but, you know, if they have to keep coming, this is probably the best of the lot, with more laughs than you might expect.
1900	1	a	A dark comedy with a dash of crime drama and a crime drama with a healthy sense of humor, American Hustle defies easy categorization as it offers up a twisty plot and some of the year's best performances.
1901	5	a	This veers a little too haphazardly between being a message movie and one of those films about an unlikely friendship. In the end, it fails to work as either.
1902	1	a	Loach invests a level of exhilaration into his wayward youths that honours the halcyon highs of childhood even in the midst of privation and decay.
1903	0	a	Dench is brilliant as the adult Philomena. In spite of her generally outgoing appearance there is a sadness behind her eyes born of five decades of heartbreak.
1904	4	a	Borte supports his jewel of a story idea with dead-on casting, stunning images and product placement that's intentionally heavy-handed.
1905	6	a	An overblown and predictable melodrama.
1906	2	a	Annette Bening is one of those rare actresses who makes a movie, however otherwise deficient, worth seeing.
1907	5	a	The film is saddled with convoluted and contrived plots that makes one question what its initial intentions are.
1908	4	a	A well-intentioned yet persistently underwhelming drama...
1909	3	a	Don't panic, but Robert Pattinson may have been neutered.
1910	4	a	This is better -- though less culturally interesting -- than the movie that inspired it.
1911	6	a	It's an unfortunately neatly packaged tale about a man who, by all evidence, constantly and consciously resisted easy repackaging.
1912	5	a	While Hawke is excellent, the film's unrelenting bleakness makes for a punishing two hours.
1913	5	a	"A limp romantic comedy, this cut-and-paste bookend to last year's ""Hitch"" finds Sarah Jessica Parker playing Paula a demoralized romantic turned ""professional interventionist."
1914	7	a	Despite some good intentions and a decent coming-of-age story, Orange County is sadly bogged down by lackluster jokes, poorly utilized celebrity cameos galore and decent if uninvolving leads.
1915	6	a	With so many good versions of this story on film, it's a little difficult to recommend this telling
1916	3	a	The film pulls few punches in its story of the hypocrisy, materialism, and opportunism at the heart of the evangelical world of Bible-thumping barnstorming revival troupes
1917	5	a	Superhero movies often must deal with the problem of villains being more charismatic than heroes. But when your hero is so annoying that you find yourself rooting for anyone who could potentially take him out, it's a real problem for the movie.
1918	6	a	Given the inherent importance of children to the Peter Pan universe, it's near fatal that Hook has so many terrible child roles.
1919	4	a	In the end, the film has more than a few moments that linger: like slivovitz, it sneaks up on you. 
1920	0	a	Still hilarious Sturges after all these years.
1921	3	a	Vice will be remembered as minor Anderson. But even greats can use a romp or two in their oeuvres.
1922	5	a	Not only has Diesel plopped the mantle of Cage on his shoulders, he seems to have borrowed one of Cage's justly celebrated hairpieces.
1923	2	a	The movie is wholly out of style these days but fun stuff, nonetheless.
1924	4	a	There's only so much humor left to wring from the pup tent of Brokeback Mountain or the matted-hair fetish of the Japanese horror genre.
1925	9	a	Harry Potter-style hocus pocus only aimed at folks who came of age in the era of the Ouija board. 
1926	4	a	"Out of the muck and mire of human depravity that is ""Killer Joe,"" something magnificent comes: a killer performance by Matthew McConaughey."
1927	1	a	A more sublime viewing experience you could scarcely hope for.
1928	3	a	"A sudsy victory lap for Team ""Shaun of the Dead."" Damned witty. "
1929	4	a	A lively and clever sci-fi feature with colorful characters and a villain that is far more than the usual cardboard cutout.
1930	3	a	It's been six years and two movies since the Coen brothers directed a feature that didn't embarrass the memory of everything else they've ever made, but, with No Country for Old Men, the writing-directing duo are back to old form.
1931	4	a	You wish that the film unfolded on a more modest scale and in the real world.
1932	5	a	What should have been a shamelessly filthy stoner movie has been watered down with ill-judged, undergraduate musings on religion, philosophy and race.
1933	1	a	One of the most important films of the year. 
1934	6	a	The result? A hit-and-miss-and-miss comedy infused with humor that's more than sketch. It's sketchy.
1935	4	a	The Cloverfield Paradox is a paradox in itself. Split between trying to be a standalone sci-fi space horror and a key linking point in the Cloverfield mythos, the film never truly succeeds at either.
1936	5	a	What Faustian bargain did Gooding make, forcing him to star in this insipid fish-out-of-water comedy that paints him as a Bolton fan?
1937	4	a	A literary tale featuring Matthew Rhys as the poet Dylan Thomas in which Sienna Miller and Keira Knightley fill up the screen with their beauty and vitality.
1938	0	a	An overlooked Woody Allen gem
1939	4	a	For once, here's a screen couple that easily adds up.
1940	4	a	Must Love Dogs makes a good first impression -- it's smart, funny and entertaining. But as the reels unwind, it's missing the special chemistry necessary to make us fall head-over-heels for it.
1941	3	a	Law is lively and Shyer keeps the action hopping with help from the movie's original gimmick of having Alfie keep up a running monologue to the audience.
1942	2	a	Middle-aged folks may not be attracted to the film's rap base but the built in youth demographic will love it.
1943	5	a	Liebesman's woefully rancid and riddled prequel of the same name is basically a horrendously harried yet uneventful hollow shell of its former bloodied self.
1944	0	a	It is an adaptation that is loving and faithful, but not slavishly so. 
1945	2	a	In Black Snake Moan Brewer balances race, religion, and sexuality in a strange yet intriguing storyline that exposes the human soul and how some people deal with emotional pain.
1946	3	a	Though Linney is the standout, short-shrift should not be given to the rest of the cast, whose roles might be smaller but they're the ones who add a little color to this otherwise dreary vista.
1947	4	a	Though the film sticks its toe into the harsher fare of dark webs and social media apathy, it never remembers to relate this form of unpleasantness with the plight of its manic main characters.
1948	2	a	While probably not suitable for the wee ones, older kids and most adults will love this exciting and heartfelt adventure of one boy's survival during the darkest days of post-war Europe.
1949	3	a	A very funny movie that is able to combine a great premise with ideal actors, laugh out scenes with a sentimental touch and over the top sequences with a believable story line.
1950	5	a	Sure, MacFarlane can write simple jokes as long as the 'f' key on his laptop holds out. Some of them are even funny. But a lot of them don't pay off, and most trod the same well-worn territory -- potheads, practical jokes, politically-incorrect cliches.
1951	9	a	While there's no denying its positive message, there's also no denying that it offers absolutely nothing fresh or innovative.
1952	3	a	Not nearly as great as Herzog's films, or as monumentally deranged as Coppola's, it nevertheless casts a spell of its own. It's one of those films that, at least for me, grows in the memory.
1953	3	a	While Moore has deserved an Academy Award for years... the surprise is Stewart, who has left the twilight zone and burst forth as a creature of brutal honesty on screen.
1954	2	a	I'd watch these two together again in a New York minute.
1955	1	a	I'm sure that multiple viewings of the movie will bring out the richness and the details, but even on first viewing, I was completely and totally engrossed.
1956	6	a	No matter how much Bertrand Bonello varies his split screens, triptychs, and geometric screen divisions, he forgets that one of the most fashionable virtues is knowing when to leave.
1957	9	a	Not even a soulful soliloquy before the closing credits about the importance of family could undo the damage already inflicted by this impressively pointless minstrel show.
1958	3	a	Peter Jackson's fourth trip to Middle-earth can't quite recapture the greatness, emotional impact or charm of the LOTR films, but there's still much to enjoy about The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey.
1959	7	a	Interesting ways people are being dismembered is never going to be enough for me.
1960	0	a	[Three Billboards] makes for soaringly satisfying viewing, yet the satisfaction comes from blistering performances and virtuosic screenwriting.
1961	4	a	While the film is unable to resolve its central subject, its background portrayal of the ongoing dissolution of the newspaper industry -- captured in a few fleeting images of layoffs and downsizing -- is vividly realized.
1962	1	a	What the film captures so well -- if imperfectly -- is the tumult inside Billy.
1963	0	a	An extraordinary psychological and sensual immersion in the psychosis of capitalism with a brilliant performance from Robert Pattinson.
1964	7	a	The Vanishing of Sidney Hall requires the audience to feel for the title character but doesn't provide any reason to truly care about this person.
1965	10	a	Rock the Kasbah is not only a catastrophic miscalculation of comic tone. It's an all-around dismal display of cinematic incompetence by scripter Mitch Glazer and director Barry Levinson, who ought to know better.
1966	0	a	Is it too early to start talking about how Martin McDonagh is one of the great writer-directors of the past decade?
1967	5	a	Among the many lacking Pulp Fiction carbon copies that refuses to realize its surrealistic shortcomings. An exaggerated and aimless mess starving for attention
1968	0	a	Faultless, freewheeling-and very funny.
1969	5	a	If... Martin Lawrence and Adam Sandler [were] in the same movie, it might... create an anti-comedy field so strong that both their careers would be sucked into the vortex...
1970	3	a	"Still Alice"" provides a valuable lesson in empathy and understanding, with a message for all of us in accepting what we've lost, and celebrating what hasn't yet gone. "
1971	6	a	Though predictable, it at least tries to put on a fresh face to a tiresome old feelgood story.
1972	2	a	At its best, The Hand That Rocks the Cradle is a bright, nasty psychological thriller with a joker up its sleeve.
1973	8	a	"Enduring the non-thrills of Devil's Due makes one thing clear: ""Found footage"" movies have passed their sell-by date."
1974	2	a	This is a sequel that expands the concept from the first film in fun and inventive ways delivering plenty of laughs along the way.
1975	4	a	Dilutes one of the loveliest voices in English literature into chick lit.
1976	3	a	The friendship message that comes wrapped in the world of Wimpy Kid gives the movie its centre and its heart, along with a reminder that there is no greater act of devotion than a kid who will submit himself to the cheese touch for a pal.
1977	1	a	Delivers the western genre goods along with generous laughs and some impressive animation--and some brazenly warped sensibilities.
1978	6	a	If you thought you were in for something light-hearted, prepare yourself for more superhero angst than Batman Begins and Hulk combined.
1979	1	a	"It's no Brokeback Mountain. There's no social, cultural, parental or ""public"" issue. It's about coming of age, not coming out. The guiltless, ephemeral exhilaration. It's an unforgettable, virtuoso achievement by Mr. Guadagnino."
1980	3	a	Both unsettling and provocative without an over-reliance on blood and guts.
1981	4	a	Middle Men spins one heck of a yarn, so crazy it must be true. 
1982	1	a	For a movie that is so much about technique, it's surprising how affecting the story is.
1983	3	a	The atmosphere is impeccable, Brewer provides enough back story for us to understand the two main characters, and the acting is fine.
1984	2	a	"Rendered in wide black-and-white shots that make the Midwest feel vast, empty and timeless, ""Nebraska"" is suffused with a rich melancholy, a slow waltz to laconic Americana banjo and fiddle music."
1985	5	a	The Force isn't with crude story of fandom and friendship.
1986	5	a	The pleasure is watching Connery shine as a roguish criminal in a story line that never gels.
1987	2	a	You'll have an absolute blast watching The Green Hornet, but its constantly goofy demeanor takes some of the sting out of it.
1988	9	a	Cross the street to avoid this one.
1989	2	a	Despite a headline-grabbing marketing push, this movie deserves more recognition for the talented cast, well-executed direction, and clever connection to it's predecessors.
1990	4	a	Just another thriller with too much plot.
1991	8	a	Not just a bad film, Hannibal Rising is downright dull, which is a far worse crime.
1992	4	a	Dated high school tale is still fun for teens.
1993	6	a	Coffy is slightly more serious and a little more inventive than it needs to be.
1994	3	a	A lighthearted tale that deftly mixes absurdist humor with touching moments and a real feeling of loneliness.
1995	3	a	Suspenseful and efficient--to the point that it feels like a soulless, though remarkably well-calibrated, machine.
1996	6	a	"The Single Moms Club"" is almost good."
1997	4	a	The film is more perky than actually funny.
1998	9	a	As played by French actor Gaspard Ulliel, Hannibal is a playing-card joker: Ulliel performs every scene with the same dimpled smirk, which looks less like an expression than a plastic-surgery mistake.
1999	9	a	If it were a send-up of couples therapy and its absurd language the film would at least be about something, but it hasn't even that much intelligence.
2000	3	a	"Delightful proof that money and fame have nothing on ingenuity and wit, ""Safety Not Guaranteed"" is worth a million meaningless blockbusters. Even if it cost millions less than any one of them."
2001	3	a	This diverting riff is as much a spoof of film-school self-seriousness as it is a sincere art project, enhanced by Yi's great, homemade puppets.
2002	3	a	The movie's own payoff is compelling enough, but the project has a weightless feel that limits involvement. Better you give it an hour-and-a-half on video someday, surrounded by wine and snacks.
2003	4	a	Julianne Moore deserves all the accolades but the movie wants tears and never quite earns them.
2004	6	a	While this unabashedly sweet and sentimental tale is everything I was afraid it would be, I could not help but be affected by it, largely due to Duvall's perfectly pitched performance
2005	6	a	The movie's solid first and second acts fail to yield dividends, and the film crumbles into a confusing, poorly edited mess in the third. 
2006	5	a	Most will find this a rather too brassy affair, handicapped by incontinent plotting. But there are probably just enough references to shape shifters, dream walkers and secret brotherhoods to keep the geeks happy.
2007	5	a	Mr. Hughes and Mr. Castle try hard to re-create a kind of timeless, idealized comic-strip atmosphere, but except for the performances of Lea Thompson and Robert Stanton... nobody in the movie seems in touch with the nature of the comedy.
2008	5	a	One could forgive the film's shortcomings if it was at least scary, or achieved some kind of creepy atmosphere, but it fails that test as well.
2009	3	a	It's a surprisingly playful romantic drama, one less about death than about the quiet, necessary grind of living.
2010	4	a	The action sequences are generally well-executed, but they're too much of a muchness. CGI makes them seem too facile and not tactile enough.
2011	4	a	Spike Lee brings a signature edge and richness to his film images, but must a filmmaker's distinctive style be so heavy that it interferes with the story itself?
2012	6	a	Singleton has a great visual sense, but he seems to be overthinking the action, and the result is an almost studious approach that tames the wildness of his stunts.
2013	4	a	"In a bit of irony, Bilbo Baggins says at the end of the movie: ""I do believe the worst is behind us."" We can only hope so."
2014	8	a	An anemic installment in the decade-old series that seems content with giving viewers more of the same.
2015	6	a	Evelyn works as a modest parable, the truth shining through in spite of the filmmakers' unfortunate oversimplifications.
2016	4	a	Early, effective version of 'Fatal Attraction' theme
2017	2	a	Soderbergh returns from retirement with a silly heist movie that packs real soul. 
2018	6	a	It's so under-dramatized that it's barely there.
2019	6	a	"So few films this holiday season can truly be labeled ""family film."" We Bought a Zoo is one. Sadly, many films wear the label of ""boring."" We Bought a Zoo is one of them."
2020	5	a	Loses touch with reality, turning this life-changing, tear-shedding, lion-roaring rebirth process into a glorified sitcom. A few beautiful scenes glazed with Crowe-brand wonder barely redeem it.
2021	2	a	On its own limited terms, The Infiltrator, like its hero, delivers the goods.
2022	3	a	Moments of brilliance and moments of boredom
2023	2	a	Midnight In Paris radiates positivity with its call to live life to the full and in the now.
2024	10	a	Idle Hands is all thumbs. Ten of 'em, black and blue and bloodied, all pointed down in deference of the Siskel and Ebert rating system. Yuck.
2025	0	a	A gorgeous film in all respects, both accessible and artistically satisfying. Excellent.
2026	3	a	A chilling idea, finely executed, in a rare remake success. See it if you dare -- but we wouldn't recommend you go alone.
2027	4	a	If the first movie was all about the ludicrous excesses of the frat-house lifestyle, then this one is all about shining a light on the inherent misogyny of the same scene.
2028	4	a	"Sympathy is generated...but not sustained drama...Sensitive portrayal [but] such a respectfully realistic but modest story as Menashe can leave the audience saying ""So nu?""."
2029	0	a	Another offbeat Almodovar treat - with another compelling Bardem performance.
2030	5	a	Dreary with a capital D.
2031	5	a	Silvers' role is loosely modeled after his good friend Milton Berle.
2032	5	a	Clunky, tin-eared caper comedy that drips with contempt for its own characters. 
2033	6	a	A flamboyant but hollow exercise in glitz and pizzazz, Saint Laurent is a riot of colors, hedonism and nonsense.
2034	6	a	"It should be retitled ""How Good It Couldn't Be."
2035	4	a	Though Fincher hits all the right emotional beats and does all the memorable set pieces, his exquisite craft can't distract from a number of troubling questions at the story's core.
2036	4	a	Burns has assembled such a fine cast that we leave feeling satisfied, as if we didn't get the iPad mini we wanted, but a pretty good novel instead.
2037	6	a	Handcuffed to this blockbuster of all blockbusters and sprawled in our reclining seats, we pass the time counting familiar scenes from other movies.
2038	0	a	Not since Goodfellas has America's dark, criminal underbelly been explored with such verve.
2039	0	a	Cage is absolutely terrific down to his eye twitches and neck jerks.
2040	3	a	The film's underwater views are breathtaking, as are its drawings and photographs of the Titanic's original splendor.
2041	3	a	Outstanding performances across the board.
2042	9	a	A unworthy sequel to a good idea.
2043	5	a	Its rebel yell takes a back seat to the inevitabilities of the squeaky plot.
2044	7	a	Manipulative claptrap, a period-piece movie-of-the-week, plain old blarney... take your pick. All three descriptions suit Evelyn, a besotted and obvious drama that tells us nothing new.
2045	0	a	In short: It's everything you could hope for from an Aardman feature.
2046	3	a	Logan Lucky hums and purrs along like an Xfinity Ford Mustang, although, once the smoke clears, you may find yourself wondering if you've been watching a film about anything.
2047	3	a	While not earth-shattering or a film that's going to change the world, it is one that made me laugh, chuckle, swoon and cry, and when it was over I walked out of the theater feeling as light as a feather and as happy as a clam.
2048	3	a	Feels like vintage Woody Allen, and that's a very good thing, indeed.
2049	4	a	A Million Ways to Die in the West hits more often than it misses.
2050	5	a	The characters are repellant, and not even in an entertaining or over-the-top way.
2051	4	a	Enough compelling moments to make one want to grab the book and fill in the blanks that the movie's script seems to have left out.
2052	4	a	The end product feels less funny than formulaic. Not to mention profoundly disheartening.
2053	3	a	This film is immensely rewarding and in its own way exceptionally beautiful.
2054	1	a	Through simple observation, Van Sant quietly lets viewers understand Nevins and feel the full force of his distress.
2055	6	a	Paul Walker has all the acting ability of a length of pine board.
2056	4	a	"Those with a high tolerance for good-natured ""teen"" raunch could do worse."
2057	6	a	Despite a good cast, this is a badly made film that only barely works as brainless filler.
2058	4	a	The photography of Arctic Tale is what makes it so good. The nature documentary style of this movie is brilliant and breathtaking at times.
2059	3	a	Cranston's multilayered performance -- riddled with surprising choices, internal conflicts and external pressures -- makes everything work.
2060	0	a	Its melding of Raymond Chandler gumshoe noir with Dick's trademark dour cybernetic musings is borderline magnificent, the themes of alienation and identity so inherent in the novel nearly popping right off the screen.
2061	4	a	There isn't an original moment in the mix, but it's not as crass or vulgar as much of what passes for 'family friendly' entertainment, and it keeps the precocious pop-culture references to a blessed minimum.
2062	6	a	...when the asinine plutonium subplot hijacks the last act, the flick goes into an unrecoverable tailspin.
2063	4	a	The result, while enjoyable enough, also feels like a missed opportunity, especially given that its come from a veteran of the franchise.
2064	4	a	Sure, it's complicated to set up the assassination of a lunatic dictator, but does it have to be so boring?
2065	4	a	remains about as graphically devoid as the old Linux command line
2066	3	a	Romero has given us, as well as the zombies, a lot to chew on. There is as much allegory to his tale as there is blood, and let me tell you, there's no shortage of blood.
2067	6	a	Think of a small-town cliche or a patronizing stereotype, and you'll find it here.
2068	4	a	The line between wacky offbeatness and just plain silliness is sadly crossed a few too many times.
2069	6	a	Earnest but dull, Agora is about the clash of science and religion, but the filmmaking elements never quite create the necessary sparks.
2070	0	a	Put simply, this is quite possibly the most fun you'll have in the cinema all year. If you like the title, you'll love the film. Highly recommended.
2071	5	a	Wilson goes from crashing weddings to crashing newlyweds in a comedy that's as tired as week-old wedding cake.
2072	5	a	It Comes at Night had the potential to grow into something special. Instead, we are left underwhelmed as we await its inevitable arrival. One which, sadly, never comes.
2073	3	a	Phoenix's extraordinary performance pulls the movie's infinite strands together. But this twisty tale takes so many foggy turns that you'll want to approach it with a plan.
2074	5	a	The world has changed since Rambo and Arnold held sway, which isn't the film's fault. But it's going to be held accountable anyway.
2075	3	a	The narrative is highly episodic and only intermittently engaging, but Gilliam's wildly inventive mise en scene, ably assisted by production designer Dante Ferretti, is extraordinary.
2076	3	a	By turns hilarious and hypnotic.
2077	1	a	The Great Beauty is an utterly ravishing portrait of listless luxuriance, a fantasy of decadent wealth and beauty that evokes Fellini's La Dolce Vita by way of Baz Luhrmann.
2078	9	a	A nearly plotless and always asinine stoner comedy that is so inconsequential it begins to evaporate from the memory before it is even over.
2079	1	a	You don't have to be a Trek weenie to have a good time at this spoof cum homage to fandom and the enduring appeal of cheesy TV, but it helps.
2080	2	a	'Hitchcock' a hoot thanks to killer cast
2081	3	a	The film is enigmatic and ethereal, but above all the brightest are Annette Bening and Jamie Bell as the actors Gloria Gahame and Peter Turner. [Full Review in Spanish]
2082	3	a	It's a puzzle that tells you not to blatantly trust what you see. It just asks you to trust the wonders of the imagination -- from whatever direction it comes.
2083	2	a	"A Royal Night Out"" is the type of movie the word ""delightful"" was made to describe, both for its largely gleeful mood and for the kind of people who use the word ""delightful."" "
2084	7	a	It's all rather clumsy and routine.
2085	4	a	The film features some really intriguing conflicts and solid performances throughout.
2086	8	a	Stupidity reigns supreme in Steve Carr's Next Friday.
2087	6	a	The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo can't quite transcend its junk foundation or...the familiar beats of the other adaptation.
2088	9	a	An empty, soulless corporate product, designed for one purpose: to separate us from our wallets.
2089	3	a	Delivers a fresh, rousing take on the venerable traditions of the monster movie.
2090	2	a	I'd hoped for better, but expected worse, which means that Michel Gondry's The Green Hornet is at best -- or at worst -- a mixed bag of a movie.
2091	6	a	The script is serviceable and sporadically amusing but lacks spark and polish; the pacing feels not brisk but downright brusque.
2092	6	a	In short, Little Man is not only height-challenged, it's comedically-challenged as well.
2093	5	a	Melodrama gets the best of everyone in a tale in which weighty ethical questions are presented with all the complexity of what one's obligation is when they find a wallet stuffed with money. 
2094	1	a	The hoods of the train robbers remind us of children's Halloween costumes, which adds to the impression that this is a movie populated by dead men too stubborn to give up the ghost.
2095	3	a	This time out, director Chris Columbus waves his wand in all the right directions. The funny scenes are funnier. The scary scenes are scarier.
2096	1	a	The film's prime force is Cumberbatch, a great actor whose talent shines here on its highest beams. It's an explosive, emotionally complex performance.
2097	3	a	It's a standard joke in screwy teen comedies, but for some reason it seems kind of fresh here.
2098	4	a	...passable as a vibrating escapist flick in spite of Proya's sporadically flat direction and the uneven interpretation of Asimov's wry commentary 
2099	1	a	Bolt has the magical quality of great animation, the ability to touch us without the hint of preachiness or manipulation.
2100	4	a	A couple of great chases, but it doesn't quite live up to its intriguing premise.
2101	5	a	Humanity's universal curiosities haven't been so vapidly exploited since The Da Vinci Code.
2102	3	a	The film romps away happily.
2103	1	a	A few rough patches aside, I found Midnight in Paris to be a delight
2104	1	a	Guillermo del Toro's fussiest, most compartmentalized construction, filled with the most powerful sense of repression and delusion.
2105	9	a	This franchise has not spawned a single good film. The crap continues.
2106	6	a	The film is at its best when it's not trying to be desperately funny, but that's rare.
2107	8	a	The Chronicle's Little Man was fighting an internal struggle to abandon his chair altogether, but was ultimately swayed to continue his nap, mostly by a few of the comics in supporting roles.
2108	5	a	A Most Wanted Man is The Spy Who Came in from the Tepid.
2109	3	a	For all Coach Carter's moralizing, it is an eminently palatable drama, and Samuel L. Jackson -- who has certainly been known to take nobility to the nth degree -- is first-rate as Carter.
2110	6	a	This movie is blatant when it should have been subtle, and this is never more evident than in the unpleasant performance of its star, Will Smith.
2111	0	a	For my dad, who died of complications from Alzheimer's. This is the movie that needed to be made.
2112	1	a	This is a movie about faith tested, and people trying to reconcile hope with a world that can feel hopeless. It's a film to be seen in a dark theater with an audience hushed in reverence of the power of cinema.
2113	5	a	Like a bridal shower, it's probably more fun if you have some champagne first. Perhaps some enterprising theater manager will consider this.
2114	5	a	For an absolutely unnecessary movie, Hannibal Rising is handsomely appointed, lushly if unimaginatively directed.
2115	4	a	Watching the movie is quite a bit like reading a slightly out-of-date Mad magazine or, I guess I should say, quite a bit like I remember Mad as a seventh-grader.
2116	2	a	McDormand's terrific as the perennially foxy rock chick, but Bale contributes the movie's most affecting performance as a son who still longs for the stability his mother could never provide.
2117	5	a	The pacing by director del Toro is so slow that by the time a ghost does show up, it's more apt to wake the audience than scare them.
2118	4	a	a gruesome but entertaining spectacle
2119	6	a	Margo's departure leaves us in the company of characters who are way less interesting than her, and the answer to her mystery, when it comes, hardly seems worth the wait.
2120	2	a	Binder's ability to make smart arguments for both sides of the issue, without becoming overly sentimental, gives Black or White a solid foundation.
2121	5	a	A pale husk of a film.
2122	1	a	More thoroughly enjoyable performances than would fit into the Oscar slate. Sacha Gervasi smacks it over the fence.
2123	4	a	Alpha Dog has much the same entertainment value you get from watching monkeys fling scat at one another in a zoo or reading the latest issue of Star magazine.
2124	5	a	Players like Hill, Long, and Zahn have natural comedic ability, but there's honestly not much they can do with such weak material.
2125	3	a	Music-driven teen flick is feel-good fun for parents, too.
2126	3	a	a bared teeth comedy about the gossiping and back biting that goes on among the wives of the band members.
2127	4	a	To some, Corbijn's movie will feel moody and complex. But anyone looking for fizz or flash will spend most of the movie engaged in a hearty game of Watch Check.
2128	3	a	Full of twists and turns like a thriller, James Marsh's compelling docu deals with provocative and timely issues, such as biological versus cultural determinism.
2129	2	a	It's popcorn movie making at its most fundamental level, executed with a sense of fun and a minimum of bombast.
2130	1	a	The film is savagely funny about the indignities of old age, yet optimistic that it's never too late to have a happy childhood.
2131	3	a	It manages to play as much like an ode to kooky alien invasion thrillers as it does to the joys of getting plastered with friends. 
2132	2	a	Sigh all you want about genre fatigue, but I say the world can never have too many movies about mouthy teens.
2133	5	a	Striking performances from Keira Knightley and Sienna Miller fail to compensate for the film's lack of narrative clarity.
2134	2	a	John Moore's remake doesn't come close to upstaging its predecessor...and yet it doesn't exactly humiliate itself either.
2135	8	a	KASBAH is crap, an entirely forgettable role for a major comedic talent
2136	4	a	A prettily decorated, politely outrageous piece of cinematic confectionary, a carefully balanced, souffle-light slice of historical fiction that has a great deal of fun playing with the truth by dropping two real-life princesses into a teen romp.
2137	3	a	Coppola's technique of trusting the actors to find and deliver their moments scores big in telling her story and overcoming its deficiencies.
2138	3	a	Amid the pandemonium there's a sense of truly rigorous soul-searching.
2139	4	a	The details in this post-apocalyptic chamber drama - flat-out horror this is not - are spare, an initially refreshing decision that ultimately results in a rather empty, half-formed narrative.
2140	4	a	If you're looking for a sugary-sweet baseball hero story, this ain't it; but it is an entertaining story about a great ex-player who could make Albert Belle look like Mother Theresa.
2141	4	a	Devil's Due, while another predictable retread, is - I am pleased to report - actually effective as a cheap drive-in style boo-gotcha thrill ride.
2142	7	a	It is the sort of film that shouldn't be cynically propping itself up with a name draw like Pattinson, but more importantly, it is the sort of film that should rouse the mind rather than dullen it with pretensions to the lectern.
2143	6	a	In the ambitious and cluttered Cadillac records, Leonard Chess redistributes income among his artists, but the point is not lost on any of them that he decides who plays when and even how to play.
2144	4	a	A crude, lewd, food-themed riff on Toy Story that basically functions as an animated parable about organised religion.
2145	10	a	I'll give ten bucks to the first gypsy willing to curse anyone even suggesting a sequel.
2146	2	a	The most acceptable Woody Allen film in a long time.
2147	5	a	This account of the late senator Ted Kennedy's bad behaviour after his car went off the road and killed his passenger, Mary Joe Kopechne, spends way too much time trying to make us feel sorry for him.
2148	5	a	Like Parker's character, I Don't Know How She Does It wants to have it all, and has trouble committing to a course of action.
2149	9	a	"Strange. ""Tim Burton's Corpse Bride"" takes off. ""Flightplan"" stinks. You'd think it would be the other way around."
2150	1	a	A savagely funny feminist take on just how dangerous stupid men can be.
2151	3	a	Together these two competing threads wrap one around the other to show us images and people we seldom get the opportunity to see, their competing agendas taking on an emotional subtext that's extremely fascinating.
2152	3	a	This is grim material, but surprisingly entertaining, and it is more cause to mourn the recent death of Shakur, who gives his best performance as Spoon, a musician who wants to get off drugs.
2153	4	a	Even if the sequel doesn't offer the delight of discovery, the trip back to Chateau Addams is more than the dead end it could have been.
2154	4	a	Doesn't do anything we haven't seen before ... yet somehow it feels credibly ripped from a larger mythology rather than being cobbled together from spare parts.
2155	3	a	Abbott's performance is serious and committed; James White is constantly fuming in an interior dispute with the rest of the world.
2156	6	a	The kind of social-issue sadness pile that confuses nonstop hardship for drama, begging for our tears at every moment.
2157	3	a	Sharp storytelling and direction take us inside, outside and all around Brown, across a span of nearly six decades---and through it all, we see, hear and feel the rhythm, music and grooves and drove him forward.
2158	3	a	[Worth watching] if only to see issues that are nowadays considered verboeten tossed around as freely as a football.
2159	3	a	Worms its way under our skin from the start, keeping us laughing as it explores love and relationships from a strikingly original angle
2160	2	a	Hitchcock remains an enjoyable film. A film about Hitchcock this may be, but not necessarily a film for Hitchcock fans.
2161	3	a	"A romantic comedy in the true sense of the word, ""Failure to Launch"" is the first certified ""date film"" of the year."
2162	5	a	About as anachronistic and generic as an action sequel could be.
2163	6	a	A strained sequel to a feature rip-off of an old television show with a stealable theme song. On screen and off, no one's getting marks for originality here.
2164	3	a	Nurse Betty is one of those films where you don't know whether to laugh or cringe, and find yourself doing both.
2165	3	a	A smart, engaging, adult comedy that is as comfortable being acerbically honest as it is being, ultimately, rather old-fashioned.
2166	1	a	The beautiful, elegant swordfights are filmed clearly and poetically, and even the down-time between battles doesn't drag too badly.
2167	5	a	Love is not the same thing as nudity. This may seem obvious, but I feel it ought to be explained to director Jean-Jacques Beineix.
2168	0	a	"Silver Linings"" feels different and fresh, also sincere."
2169	1	a	works principally through the force of its undeniable realism
2170	5	a	"Metter's ""Girls"" may just want to have fun but for the rest of us this concept is just wishful thinking."
2171	3	a	"Between these films and ""Scott Pilgrim Versus the World,"" Wright has become very deft at using genre conventions to illustrate the human comedy while still giving his audience a ripping good time."
2172	4	a	This is a worthwhile story told with lukewarm emotion. The doomed love comes off as less a tragedy than a pity. The background makes this story more interesting than the foreground does.
2173	0	a	Paul Muni gives a heart-wrenching performance.
2174	3	a	Jack Goes Boating is a successful work of art. To see this movie is to feel that you've lived it.
2175	3	a	...the project resonates because of the talent of its stars...
2176	6	a	Once they go into the woods, the movie becomes as interesting as watching kids hang around and play with sticks.
2177	6	a	Its dearth of cohesive reasoning will leave you shaken but frustratingly unstirred.
2178	3	a	A great movie with an even cooler ending, this film will likely be remembered as one of the better thrillers of the year.
2179	1	a	"Marie was called to bear witness, and what made her a legend, and what perhaps cost her life, was both her boldness and her humanity as a reporter. ""A Private War"" never lets you forget this woman contained both in spades."
2180	5	a	Dull and plodding presentation of an interesting period of Japanese history.
2181	3	a	Morgan Freeman doesn't play Mandela as much as inhabit the man, in a performance that seems to embody the very transcendence that Mandela himself has come to stand for.
2182	3	a	A landmark in modern cinema.
2183	3	a	Dead languages and horrific violence aside, this is a film everyone should see, whether they hold any religious beliefs or not.
2184	5	a	the film starts off with the best of intentions and ends like an epic pub crawl usually does. No hangover, though - it's a good time in retrospect.
2185	2	a	"Hello, My Name Is Doris"" is a story about not wanting to be forgotten, or even deemed unessential. It stars Sally Field at her most Sally Field: gently neurotic, goofy, adorable and heartbreaking."
2186	1	a	A shrewd, scintillating work rooted in an investigation of varying degrees of masculinity and extremism.
2187	3	a	Malcolm D. Lee's exuberant Girls Trip easily outclasses the likes of Bad Moms and Rough Night.
2188	3	a	... an intense, ultimately uplifting character study ... 'Sex in the City's' Nixon is so good as the title character's stricken mother she should be remembered come Oscar nomination time.
2189	0	a	Victor Sjostrom's magnificent performance carries an emotional authority that gives Bergman's great movie a warmth and an accessibility that it might not otherwise have had.
2190	6	a	Despite this inconsistency and Schneider's one-note turn, the film does offer a few amusing moments. All too often, however, The Hot Chick feels like a cold fish.
2191	6	a	Self-absorption might be a common teen trait, but its glorification here may fail to excite those old enough to know they don't know everything.
2192	1	a	Robbins and Penn in particular give simply fantastic performances that defy description - it is the kind of work you have to just sit back and feel.
2193	4	a	A standard-issue rom-com in almost every respect, but the irresistible charm of its lead pushes it over the top.
2194	9	a	In the past, Cronenberg has used such deadpan performances to striking effect, but in the case of Cosmopolis, the approach just leaves a giant vaccum in the soul of the celluloid
2195	3	a	This isn't a breakthrough movie, but for what it is, it's charming, and not any more innocuous than it has to be.
2196	3	a	At any moment, the movie looks as if it could fall into sermonizing or prejudice. Veber's ability to dodge these pitfalls is as engaging as the gags he creates.
2197	5	a	The profanity-free squareness is close to excruciating: You won't believe how boring it is partying with real-life heroes.
2198	2	a	... Succeeds on the basis of pure delight, the optimism it emits and an earned happily-ever-after ending.
2199	2	a	The effect for the uninitiated is like being the only stranger at a party otherwise of old friends, who can converse in shorthand incomprehensible to the outsider. 
2200	1	a	It's just about everything you'd want in a summer movie, combining elements of romance, science fiction and comedy juiced with an element of frat-boy attitude. 
2201	8	a	"Boring, morose and uneventful, ""Wristcutters: A Love Story"" is a stinky little picture that mocks the afflicted while giving them a pat on the back."
2202	6	a	Fitzgerald Gumpified...a gorgeously-made would-be tearjerker that leaves the ducts dry because of its extreme artificiality, in both plot and execution.
2203	6	a	The movie falls off the cliff of melodrama by the midway point, and unless you decide to walk out, you're going to follow this scenic heap of sunsets and moody ocean shots as it wails on its laborious descent.
2204	0	a	Enthralling, explosive and often very funny, Skyfall doesn't just exceed expectations but shatters them.
2205	5	a	An American Pie variation without the affection for its characters or original humor.
2206	4	a	An enjoyable sequel.
2207	2	a	This weird comedic fantasy lampoons pop philosophy and everything else within reach but wastes the talents of Dustin Hoffman.
2208	3	a	As a concert film it's unparalleled: a stunningly photographed, soul-stirring celebration.
2209	6	a	This is one instance where a work of literature remained beyond the scope of the medium of film.
2210	0	a	Has one of the best and strangest casts in all of movies.
2211	4	a	The scariest moments in this film have nothing to do with gut-munching and everything to do with evolution, when the zombies don't behave the way they're supposed to.
2212	1	a	A thought-provoking mind-bender, a wake-up punch to our collective solar plexus.
2213	6	a	Timeline treats the past like an amusement park, offering mid-level thrills and nothing more.
2214	2	a	[It] isn't as good as its predecessor, but it's a fun comedy made by smart, talented people, and it's certainly a lot better than you would expect.
2215	3	a	Technically and stylistically, The Tin Drum is an astounding work. Thematically, it strives for an importance it only sometimes achieves
2216	5	a	the world of the film is so narrow that pre-occupation Japan looks like a feudal Disneyland, where everybody knew their place and the cherry blossoms were always falling
2217	4	a	Vantage Point offers a modicum of entertainment but it requires viewers to react more forcefully from the gut than the mind. It's viscerally effective but lobotomized.
2218	4	a	I sensed I was missing part of the experience. A big part.
2219	2	a	Though many movies have explored Eastern culture and juxtaposed it against the American experience, there still is something to learn here, especially because it repeatedly questions what's important in life.
2220	3	a	I refuse to call it a trilogy....I hope they end up with at least as many in the series as there are flavors of Cornetto ice cream treats.
2221	6	a	"They aimed for ""Midnight Run,"" settled for attempting ""Due Date,"" and wound up with ""Guilt Trip."
2222	0	a	Dramatic, emotional, even heartbreaking, as well as wickedly funny, it has the gift of going its own way, a complete success from a singular talent.
2223	4	a	It's a nice story, and it does feel good, but it's too formulaic and syrupy
2224	7	a	Kudos to Eastwood for good intentions, but stories, like trains, need a dependable surface. This train is running on jointed tracks. 
2225	6	a	It appears as if even the filmmakers didn't know what kind of movie they were making.
2226	1	a	It is as fascinating as a train wreck, as well as the most sensitive, wryly compassionate, immaculately acted and uncannily real a movie portrait of a dysfunctional marriage as I can remember seeing since Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?
2227	8	a	...one of the few sequels in the history of cinema that is an unqualified improvement over its predecessor in every way.
2228	5	a	A movie of utter inconsequence -- a cinematic Listerine Strip that evaporates from the brain before you even get your popcorn tub to the trash.
2229	3	a	Yes, the film does have its grosser moments but overall the film is Schneider's best comedy to date.
2230	7	a	Singleton's movie is as ingenious as a cop in a car chase movie.
2231	3	a	This may be a film about the end of the world, but ... It Comes at Night tracks something akin to a domestic apocalypse.
2232	4	a	The familiar character-driven story is yet another fast-paced, high-stakes, globe-trotting adventure with shaky hand-held camerawork and quick-cut editing.
2233	0	a	Aside from some unfortunate slapstick, it's a truly spectacular superhero sequel.
2234	2	a	While Stallone's film won't win any Oscars, it gives off a dopey genre high that's hard not to catch.
2235	3	a	A gleefully vulgar and very funny spoof of the Pixar formula.
2236	3	a	The House with a Clock in Its Walls is a thrilling world to spend time in, combining classic elements of a good family horror movie to lovely effect. For kids, parents, and kids-at-heart, it's a great way to kick off the Halloween season.
2237	6	a	...tour-de-force performances from Foxx and Downey, but they cannot make up for a story that it is largely commonplace.
2238	2	a	Michael Stuhlbarg gives a strong supporting performance as Elio's compassionate father and Hammer is very well-cast, but Chalamet owns the film with his passionate ambiguity.
2239	1	a	What a bold stroke of sensory genius on [Ava DuVernary's] part to lull us into a false sense of security before slapping us in the face with the reality that Selma is not your usual biography.
2240	0	a	River leads moviegoers on a suspense-filled, sometimes painful adventure marked by great performances.
2241	3	a	As is his want, Mr. Nolan jumps between time periods and voice-overs with reckless abandon. The movie's real trick is that it all somehow manages to congeal.
2242	3	a	An excellent follow-up that confirms Bourne as a first-class movie franchise.
2243	6	a	What saves Matchstick Men from being a complete washout are the performances by Cage, Sam Rockwell and Alison Lohman.
2244	4	a	As these pieces fall into place, Turing becomes ever more sympathetic while still feeling beyond anyone's ability to help or even understand.
2245	5	a	It's a Hallmark Hall of Fame special dressed up as a feature, one that juggles feel-good humanitarianism and oddly inappropriate stabs at whimsy.
2246	5	a	In Mann's attempt to make something artsy and grown-up, he has neglected the element of fun.
2247	0	a	Think of it as a high quality version of one of the old movie serials that kids used to get every Saturday at the theater before the double feature.
2248	6	a	Usually you can laugh with a bad movie it or laugh at it. But Snakes on a Plane is laughing at you. It not only fulfills the low expectations of its title, it Tasers them into submission.
2249	6	a	Whoever let the dogs out should probably consider a career change.
2250	4	a	Twin Falls Idaho is flawed in many ways but its virtues also cannot be denied.
2251	7	a	Soulless, sleekly executed product with something for everyone.
2252	9	a	It should be said that Scary Movie fails on most of its essential levels, and therefore, is only worth seeing to support Tim Curry's and David Cross' careers.
2253	3	a	It Comes at Night is a masterful work of spooky suspense. Writer-director Trey Edward Shults has created a claustrophobic gem of a movie.
2254	4	a	Romance and poetry have no time to sag
2255	1	a	An audacious, astonishingly confident debut feature...a haunting, deeply personal and wonderfully experimental collage of genres and themes.
2256	5	a	Bad in ways that are almost endearing...
2257	7	a	Let's hope next time they get a literate script, an engaging plot, a better-suited supporting cast and a more restrained director.
2258	4	a	In a sense, Ralph Breaks The Internet is like most things online these days; it's amusing while you're engaged with it but as soon as your mind is elsewhere, there's not all that much about it to hold on to.
2259	5	a	The inspirational sports movie cliches notwithstanding, Crossover is just bad filmmaking that does not serve either its cast or its audience well.
2260	6	a	The only way this movie becomes any fun is when it stops impersonating a game and simply becomes one.
2261	1	a	One of the best sci-fi fantasy films in a long, long time.
2262	4	a	A fun movie that could have been brilliant if it had been just a bit more bonkers.
2263	4	a	plays more like a long television show than a feature film, which gives it a level of energy and fun
2264	6	a	As you'd predict, Tripp and Paula fall in love. It's not very interesting. Then he finds out she's a hired hand, he freaks, they split, they get back together, and blah, blah, blah.
2265	3	a	The movie, for all its flaws, reminds us that everyone is worth catching, but it's the actors who best embody that message. They go the full human being.
2266	0	a	The whole tale is told with a dreamy, jet-lagged feel, that part wonder, part nasueous feeling brought about by significant travel. Jet lag as a metaphor for love, a delicious combination. Simply a must-see film.
2267	4	a	There's no compelling reason why these two characters ought to be compatible except that their names come first and second in the opening credits.
2268	5	a	You'd think that you'd have plenty of room for good humour when trying to spoof the western genre, but MacFarlane falls back on the same childish material again and again.
2269	4	a	It lacks the scale, the chills and the wonder of the original, but is more fun as a thrill ride than its sequel predecessor.
2270	5	a	... what winds up in the picture's largely lazy grasp is largely evidence of the influence of, well, any number of cheap and often straight-to-video testosterone fests.
2271	4	a	Falls flat as often as it makes magic, the cumulative effect as comforting as a night spent at your coffee shop taking in humanity's endlessly colourful social exchanges.
2272	2	a	An amusing enterprise that walks a fine, clever line on a tricky topic without ever giving offense.
2273	3	a	Preposterous but viscerally juicy
2274	4	a	Summit Entertainment has tried just a little too hard to broaden the appeal of its new computer-animated feature Astro Boy.
2275	3	a	Better than countless animated films that have received big-screen releases.
2276	5	a	What could, and should, have been as fun and daring as skipping school turns out to be as dull as a two-hour detention.
2277	3	a	Russell turns the pursuit of the American dream into the ultimate escapism.
2278	5	a	Dano and Kline are very fine performers. So why is this comedy such a chore? The answer appears to be whimsy overload.
2279	3	a	In the end, you'll be savouring an emotion not often engendered by film: tranquillity, a calm acceptance, tinged with joy and flecked with sadness, of life's up-and-down journey.
2280	4	a	Everyone loves a David and Goliath tale or one where the underdog gets a real chance; Invictus is such a story.
2281	5	a	Fun Mom Dinner is the equivalent of mom using bargain basement ingredients to make your favorite homecooked meal. 
2282	3	a	Smart, edgy adaptation captures the humor of self-discovery.
2283	0	a	An astonishing documentary about a chimp raised as a human and the calamitous consequences.
2284	5	a	Doom is a treat for sadists, an empty time-passer for people who need only continuous noise and action, and a bane to the rest of us. Be warned or encouraged accordingly.
2285	0	a	First Reformed slowly builds toward an inevitable conclusion, but Schrader confounds those expectations with an ending that will certainly leave you talking. This isn't easy fare, but it's wholly worthwhile.
2286	2	a	Three months into the year and finally a decent romantic comedy hits theaters.
2287	0	a	There's not a word or a wistful glance out of place in Sofia Coppola's offbeat comedy drama.
2288	6	a	"This by-the-numbers pratfall-fest is as synthetically generic as a ""Happy Holidays"" card from your realtor."
2289	3	a	Eschewing all sentiment, avoiding all pathos, keeping his film and most of the women hard as nails, [Sayles] manages to tell a compelling story.
2290	0	a	McDonagh encompasses equal parts of engagement, humor, and enlightenment. It's the gold standard of a terrific script paired with even better storytelling. 
2291	3	a	With his first animated feature, Pirates of the Caribbean director Gore Verbinski shows ambitions considerably beyond producing the usual standard of most children's fare. To put it plainly, Rango is one weird movie.
2292	3	a	It's overly complex, yet Almidivar somehow finds a way to wrangle the beast in... the full work of art is stunning.
2293	5	a	Dystopian young adult film fails to connect despite its relevant theme of youth resistance.
2294	5	a	Johnny Depp and Angelina Jolie, benchmarks for sexual arousal in other movies, have zero emotional and physical chemistry in The Tourist.
2295	5	a	Clever lines and a fine performance by Owen Wilson aren't enough to redeem this flat and oddly unnerving comedy.
2296	10	a	An inflated TV show by a sitcom creator.
2297	1	a	...virtually every single scene is interesting on a purely visceral level.
2298	6	a	...suffers from an often unwatchable first half that admittedly does give way to a passable final stretch...
2299	4	a	The drawback is the usual one: a standard young-adult novel view of adults as predatory, clueless, patronizing, grotesque...yet the director evokes that terrible time of waiting around, locked out of childhood and adulthood alike. 
2300	4	a	The fans attracted to Max Payne will readily leave any disbelief by the doors as the action ramps up.
2301	3	a	Idiosyncratic and highly original.
2302	3	a	Samuel L. Jackson, who has pretty much been swaggering through recent roles, straightens up and brings a steely, dignified strength to the title role.
2303	9	a	For some reason, teasing people about their skin color has become a big theme of brainless black comedies like this. Plus, it unfolds like one long Pepsi ad, with dialogue extolling the cola's virtues in virtually every scene.
2304	4	a	Unfortunately, in Getaway, the bad things that happen include a lazy script.
2305	4	a	When a franchise descends to jokes about how it's run out of ideas, and setting things on fire, not once but twice, it's one movie past time to stop.
2306	6	a	A lavishly mounted but maddeningly uninvolving piece about dueling stage magicians.
2307	1	a	What starts out as a hodgepodge of Pulp Fiction, Trainspotting and Reservoir Dogs slowly becomes as enjoyable and visually stylish as the films from which Lock, Stock draws its comparisons.
2308	9	a	Failure to Launch is a not-so-distant cousin of those happy-go-lucky herpes commercials that play on television--it's so far out it scans as science fiction.
2309	6	a	[Depp] does make the experience far more watchable than it ought to be...with his eccentric, outwardly violent manifestations of his inner turmoil
2310	4	a	Isaac Asimov's colorful fantasies for teenage boys a half-century and more ago are intact.
2311	3	a	A teenage art-flick, Paranoid Park proves the most fluent and coherent of Gus Van Sant's recent experiments. Part crime mystery, part coming-of-age story, it's positively overflowing with burnished imagery and adolescent turmoil.
2312	3	a	In the category of zombie movies, this is top shelf.
2313	3	a	the film succeeds because it has genuine heart, a couple of mildly-thrilling action sequences, and most notably, a hilarious supporting performance by Mark Walton, who plays Rhino the hamster.
2314	4	a	Funny often enough to make it worth watching.
2315	5	a	superficial and staged
2316	4	a	Charlyne Yi is so darn cute and self-effacing, I can just about forgive a further battering of the line between what's real and what's scripted.
2317	2	a	It took ten years, but here, finally, is a worthwhile sequel to The Fast and the Furious
2318	1	a	A seductively entertaining, fangs-bared historical comedy.
2319	10	a	My cat has coughed up hairballs that make more sense than MIAMI VICE
2320	4	a	Another top-notch effort from Pollack.
2321	3	a	When Spacey goes ballistic, only to freeze the nitroglycerine in his veins a moment later, you don't want to look anywhere else.
2322	3	a	Tough-minded yet often touching, The Soloist works precisely because it doesn't go where we think it's going to go.
2323	4	a	[Black's] various homages to the first two Predator movies filled me with several moments of pure geek-tastic joy.
2324	2	a	Worthy, even though its a simplistic monster movie at heart.
2325	6	a	The only downside is that you can't use cheat codes to reach the end of the movie.
2326	5	a	The word 'bore' comes to mind
2327	4	a	... the tape is an excellent way to have fun, without question. [Full review in Spanish]
2328	9	a	There is not one redeeming quality to this movie
2329	9	a	Might be the least-sexy film about a hedonist ever made, unless bawdy and bewigged somehow add up to erotic.
2330	0	a	Jim Jarmusch's most stunning achievement.
2331	1	a	It's both a challenging and engulfing movie-going experience -- a true journey on multiple levels. And it's definitely one that should be seen on the big screen.
2332	1	a	Woody Allen's most entertaining comedy in years...
2333	4	a	Habemus Papam wants to emphasise the human consequences of a great religious office, and in that it succeeds. But Moretti's narrative construction lets him, and his film, down.
2334	3	a	The movie isn't for everyone. But if it grabs you, prepare for it to stick in your head for days.
2335	5	a	Wait for the video.
2336	6	a	Middle Men is an anxious film, but not in a good way, in that it doesn't generate suspense so much as dread.
2337	6	a	This is a movie for every single high school senior in America who has just completed or is right now going through the process of applying to college.
2338	0	a	It lingers uneasily in the subconscious. Furious and darkly funny, it's a tight, explosive encapsulation of our very specific moment in history.
2339	4	a	Taken at surface level, The Joneses does succeed in presenting its attack on consumerism; and for that alone it sparks up talking points and will leave you to think about exactly why you bought the model of car or mobile phone you did.
2340	7	a	An absolute misfire.
2341	4	a	As date-night piffle goes ... it's thoroughly engaging.
2342	3	a	An extraordinary documentary that heightens our connection with the lives and destinies of an Arctic polar bear and a walrus.
2343	4	a	It's a warm-but-thin rom-com that isn't particularly noteworthy outside of its trailblazing subject matter. Its heart is in the right place, however, which gives it a light stamp of approval.
2344	3	a	This is the sort of role Smith carries off effortlessly, a decent, level-headed all-American guy who's more sensitive than his imposing physique might suggest.
2345	2	a	How you react to it depends mostly on what you take in with you.
2346	4	a	A likably cast, mildly diverting Halloween appetizer that serviceably channels early Harry Potter.
2347	3	a	Having allowed the material to seethe and stew, director Danny Boyle cooks up another tremendous cocktail of drug taking, violence and prostitution.
2348	4	a	Features fine performances by a cast of veteran actors but is marred by its unconvincing back story.
2349	3	a	The high-flying fun is limited solely be the poultry running time.
2350	9	a	Too bad the script doesn't extend the same courtesy to the actors, who are saddled with dialogue neither man nor beast could respond to.
2351	5	a	Paul Blart: Mall Cop is so inconsequential you forget about it even before the movie is over.
2352	5	a	Is it possible that Natalie Portman can't act?
2353	3	a	Not all comic-book films have to be as weighty and angst-filled as a graphic novel. Fantastic Four is neither fantastic nor incredible, but it's entertaining nonetheless.
2354	3	a	It's breezy and fun and, like its predecessor, relies more for its appeal on nostalgia and familiarity than a strong narrative thrust.
2355	2	a	"Italians have a phrase -Che posso fare?- meaning ""What can I do?"" that's sometimes used when the answer is: ""Nothing, just go with it."" Lots of things happen in Eat Pray Love that only the lonely and book club members will understand. You just go with it."
2356	8	a	Instead this coming-of-age romance resonates something more pervasive and relatable, a moment that escapes us and a feeling that imprisons us.
2357	0	a	At a time when wedding parties gone wild is the plot du jour in movie comedies, it's reassuring to know that Woody Allen's cerebral absurdity is still intact.
2358	3	a	Ends up just being a fairly good Bad Movie.
2359	3	a	Equally thought-provoking, funny, sweet and tender.
2360	5	a	"The Way Back"" is a boring movie. Repetitive, protracted and wearisome. Mostly, though: It's just long."
2361	4	a	As a bold, eye-filling spectacle, Crimson Peak will gratify any fan of fantasy and horror. In plot terms, though, there's something lacking.
2362	2	a	...a sweet, humane bit of entertainment that - unlike formulaic Hollywood movies - doesn't condescend to its audience.
2363	6	a	This anti-Close Encounters is a spectacular technical exercise, but in the final analysis it's as loud and soulless a piece of equipment as the aliens' Tripod Death Stars.
2364	4	a	It is entertaining and often very funny, even when you hope that director Harron will next find a subject that is truly worthy of her considerable talents.
2365	6	a	...the film's few sparks of originality and charisma are stamped out by a script and a director who refuses to take any genuine chances with the subject material.
2366	2	a	"The critical consensus from Cannes about Nebraska is that it's ""minor Payne."" I think it might be more accurate to call it a transitional film, with one foot in his old techniques and one tentatively standing in new ones."
2367	0	a	Woody Allen's unhurried tribute to the art, passion and power of the written word and to Paris is fabulous. His best film in a decade. 
2368	3	a	An authoritative, beautifully assembled, personal, even romantic account of one of rock music's most important waypoints, a film which aficionados absolutely should not miss.
2369	0	a	One of those truly rare films that feels both profound and grounded; inspirational without ever manipulatively trying to be so.
2370	1	a	Litvak's careful poduction overcomes any flaws.
2371	3	a	Absorbing, uncomfortable, complex and unapologetically bold in the narrative and spiritual roads it travails.
2372	9	a	[A] tawdry little melodrama.
2373	3	a	Coasts by like a rocket, thanks to Keaton's inspired performance and Burton's dark-carnival lunacy.
2374	5	a	"Your appreciation of the movie will hinge on your tolerance for the ""quirky"" antics of Spade."
2375	4	a	This is the least personal movie [Levinson has] made in years, and the script is more a shortening of Crichton's story than a dramatization.
2376	3	a	Inspired action choreography, macho mentality, aggressive stunt work and nimble editing rule. Despite a few sluggish moments, it had me and it left me all revved up.
2377	2	a	Even with its small defects, though, The Joneses feels fresh and original, smart and tart.
2378	2	a	When Highlander sticks to the hand-to-hand battles and doesn't try to offer deeper thoughts on the life of an immortal, it works on its own terms.
2379	6	a	"Conscientiously, if conventionally edited re-hash of the Oscar-winning ""We Were Kings."
2380	1	a	I cannot recommend this movie enough. It's a funny, bright thriller that is an example of twisted perfection.
2381	6	a	Though intermittently amusing and exhilarating, Taking Woodstock can't quite pull together its threads into one totally trippy tapestry.
2382	3	a	The material may be lightweight, but it's been shaped into a film that deserves to become a classic in an admittedly lightweight genre.
2383	3	a	Alfie is such smooth, crisp entertainment, you barely even notice it has nothing new to say.
2384	3	a	The movie works, thanks in large part to Chi's performance.
2385	2	a	Think of it as The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel with middle-aged men in English pubs with aliens, robots and a lot more drinking.
2386	6	a	Visually and narratively flat.
2387	3	a	Capturing the site, the sounds, the smells, and the sweat of a major musical happening, Soul Power is irresistible.
2388	5	a	Bwooklyn Meg sounds a whole lot like Margot Kidder impersonating Phyllis Diller. The accent comes and goes, but it remains the most entertaining aspect of the entire movie.
2389	6	a	"As a teen movie, ""The Perfect Score"" is just passable."
2390	5	a	Earth hath not anything to show more daft than The Predator.
2391	0	a	This Coen Brothers adaptation of the Cormac McCarthy novel may be their darkest film yet. It's also one of their best.
2392	0	a	It is a fairly brutal and stylized account of the miseries of a famous comedian/director.
2393	3	a	In the face of a decade of cynical misanthropy, the optimistic and effervescent Midnight in Paris is Allen's most purely enjoyable work in years.
2394	9	a	By the time it starts getting dramatic, I was rooting for each one of them to get a divorce.
2395	6	a	This ended up being one meal that left me hungering for something more substantive, constantly hoping for a second course that sadly hadn't been prepared for me to taste.
2396	0	a	Wonderfully conveys how the act of loving another can be a game, a sacrifice, a ruse, a weapon, a betrayal, and, most of all, a political act.
2397	3	a	AS with previous films The Fighter and Silver Linings Playbook, David O Russell can expect to bother the prize-givers this award season with American Hustle.
2398	4	a	Bloody to the point of gruesome, moving without being inspiring.
2399	4	a	Sly sequel is as predictable as a gym workout.
2400	2	a	Hotel for Dogs sends out a positive message about animals in need.
2401	10	a	Director Andrzej Bartkowiak wants to give us the ultimate sugar rush, but all we get is the rush with none of the sugar and the come down is headache inducing.
2402	0	a	"Nebraska"" is Alexander Payne's best film, bar none."
2403	4	a	You need more than generic flash, dash and martial-arts moves to make a memorable thriller. Or do you?
2404	7	a	MTV offers an airbrushed portrait that does nothing but perpetuate the myth of an 'angelic' hoodlum.
2405	2	a	What Fincher brings to the table is a particular talent for atmospheric, highly stylized mystery. What he can't really fix is the fact that the source material is, structurally, a mess.
2406	6	a	The film wavers uncomfortably between parody and homage, between deconstructing the excesses of the genre and simply indulging in them.
2407	10	a	...the same time our government debates torture...our movie industry produces another heinous horror flick that centers on the cruel and unusual punishment of captive humans.
2408	9	a	The movie left me with the feeling of being trapped with a person of privilege who won't stop with the whine whine whine.
2409	4	a	Eli Roth's tween-friendly spookfest has jump-worthy scenes. 
2410	5	a	Don't waste the bucks.
2411	0	a	The fusion of the ancient and the modern -- even to the point of some sly echoes of our own sports-mad society -- is seamless. Gladiator does indeed deliver the glory that was Rome, but it also clinically dissects the assumptions on which it was built.
2412	3	a	Not every biopic needs to reinvent the form. Sometimes it's enough to inhabit it, engagingly.
2413	0	a	"Carol"" demonstrates that a period piece can engagingly comment on modern times."
2414	4	a	Enormously engaging in its opening segments, it's unable to sustain that good feeling over the long haul.
2415	4	a	Liberated from her trademark snark, Plaza tackles the awkwardness of fledgling foreplay with screwball abandon.
2416	4	a	I'm not sure the movie will end up earning back its stars' huge salaries, but you definitely can't argue they didn't earn them.
2417	3	a	I wish this movie wasn't so purposefully elegiac and attenuated -- at times it's like a middling Terrence Malick fantasia -- but it's well worth sitting through.
2418	3	a	A haunting, strange and lyrical narrative on one man's spiritual and political resurrection from the darkest corners of his consciousness. First Reformed brims with insights on anger, guilt, faith and personal autonomy.
2419	5	a	Padilha succumbs to monotonous, hollow flamboyance with his City of God clone.
2420	1	a	Bolt is fast-paced, funny and beautifully animated -- a charming movie that would have Benji and Lassie howling in jealousy.
2421	0	a	Superior biopic with an unforgettable performance by Sissy Spacek
2422	5	a	Mark Felt: The Man Who Brought Down the White House has nothing to offer.
2423	8	a	Stale, derivative, and largely uneventful, testing the patience of moviegoers as directors Bettinelli-Olpin and Gillett elect to conjure a sense of rehearsed reality, only to skip any justification for the images on the screen.
2424	1	a	"Embrace of the Serpent"" takes a journey into the heart of darkness, but it takes a journey into the heart of light as well."
2425	2	a	It's an altogether funny, charming piece, with much to hold a viewer's interest in an uncomplicated, childlike way.
2426	4	a	It's like Tom Sawyer's Great Escape - a strange combination of stories that's interesting, but doesn't quite capture your emotions.
2427	6	a	The result is an action comedy where the comedy frequently hits the bull's-eye but is overpowered by the action.
2428	3	a	A wonderfully exciting, incredibly idiosyncratic actioner.
2429	3	a	engrossing and rather endearing
2430	6	a	The film failed to be imaginative enough.
2431	3	a	delivers the kind of sharply timed laughs that Sturges and Wilder would've appreciated
2432	4	a	A second-rate thriller with first-rate production values.
2433	5	a	Eventually, Max pieces together a conspiracy, but Max Payne spells it all out so obviously that the densest audience members will put the pieces together at least half an hour before the hero finally does.
2434	9	a	Leering and drooling sci-fi sex farce.
2435	3	a	Flattened for years on cable and video, Nightmare has been resurrected in all its tactile glory.
2436	6	a	For a while, you're waiting for Memoirs of a Geisha to start. Then you can't wait for it to end.
2437	3	a	The structure with which the film is designed turns out to be as beneficial and intriguing as it is unsatisfactory and imprecise. [Full Review in Spanish]
2438	1	a	It remains an influence on the modern blockbuster, and is one of its best examples.
2439	1	a	Like a fantasy project developed by a dirty-minded child, and we can all share in the adolescent stupidity and irresponsibility of it. It's a blast.
2440	1	a	Provide[s] nail-biting suspense and credible characters without relying on technology-of-the-moment technique or pretentious dialogue.
2441	5	a	The fan-funded revival of Rob Thomas's much-loved teen-PI series proves more footnote than fresh start.
2442	3	a	Andrew Dominik's sensational film debags a cherished idol. Tyrone Power, Robert Wagner and Roy Rogers famously played Jesse James like Robin Hood. Brad Pitt plays him like a poisonous Mr Hyde.
2443	0	a	[A] devastatingly powerful and astonishingly vivid Holocaust drama.
2444	3	a	Will Smith began his acting career as a prince, and he remains one of the most engaging, adorable actors on the planet.
2445	6	a	Southeast sizzle and undercover-cop cool are kept to such a minimum that Miami Vice may as well have been transferred to St. Louis.
2446	5	a	"Just when you thought the ""La-La Land"" cliche ... had been done to death, along comes the indie-film variation in Laurel Canyon."
2447	3	a	Classic Davis soaper with Henreid doing the double cigarette bit.
2448	6	a	[Bertolucci] builds an homage to beauty around a sullen void.
2449	9	a	The only noticeable Resident Evil on display here is the lack of creativity in the minds of the filmmakers.
2450	7	a	I wanted to laugh hardily but I hardly cracked a smile and definitely did not have my Kasbah rocked.
2451	4	a	There are moments when you can see how terrific this film could have been
2452	9	a	...doomed to the dreaded obscurity of films so bad, they don't even get made fun of on Saturday Night Live.
2453	4	a	If the thought of another Australian film with a soundtrack full of ABBA songs scares you away from this film, buck up and see it anyway.
2454	10	a	Whether or not you appreciate Dane Cook's spastic, hyperactive brand of observational humor, he cannot be held solely responsible for the unmitigated disaster that is 'Good Luck Chuck.'
2455	4	a	Cruise, Singer, lose the credibility battle.
2456	9	a	The lead actor looks a little like Steve Martin, which got me to thinking that digitally inserting that comedian could make something out of this imploded building of a movie.
2457	6	a	I guess if you're super attractive, you don't need things like oxygen.
2458	6	a	This is easily the worst filmed version of anything penned by the prolific author.
2459	3	a	Reasonably exciting.
2460	2	a	Enjoins eight of France's finest actresses in a giddily amusing Agatha Christie-style whodunit.
2461	9	a	Writer-director Iain Softley went out and bought the Paint-By-Numbers kit for making a rock 'n' roll movie.
2462	4	a	This smack in the face of good manners is surprising and strange, often delightfully so.
2463	3	a	Alfred Hitchcock, England's jovial and rotund master of melodrama, has turned out another crisply paced, excellently performed film.
2464	4	a	Though the film is crowd-pleasing enjoyable, it never fully brings in enough light to its underground setting to completely satisfy as a fully realized work.
2465	3	a	The result also has the authentic quality of real people clinging to the aphorisms and going through the motions demanded by the situation and the times, all of which is bathed in lush regret by cinematographer Roger Deakins.
2466	8	a	Buy the soundtrack. Skip the film.
2467	4	a	Unfortunately, Figgis' surface-level potboiler would rather pursue hit-and-miss scares than explore cleverer conceits like its promising class-war subtext.
2468	9	a	This is an ungainly movie, ill-fitting, with its elbows sticking out where the knees should be.
2469	1	a	Dark, cynical, but deliciously funny, Heathersis a fascinating look not just at high school but at the way we look at high school.
2470	3	a	For a movie that's essentially a gender-scrambled version of Midnight Run, Identity Thief is an amiable rip-off.
2471	3	a	Jenkins doesn't stint on the sickening reality of Wuornos' abhorrent behavior -- it's Theron's complex, deeply felt depiction of a thoroughly messed-up soul that forces us to look beyond the monstrous nature of her acts.
2472	4	a	Huge laughs are offset by dead spots.
2473	2	a	[Chappaquiddick] undoubtedly rests on the shoulders of Jason Clarke, and Clarke turns in one of his finest performances.
2474	8	a	While The Predator tries to lean on nostalgic reverence for that first movie, it also can't find a tonal mix that works.
2475	2	a	It's funny, it's familiar and you can see a lot of the situations transferring over to your own life.
2476	6	a	It's not an instructive or illuminating experience...but a visceral and vicious one. [I]t's Mel Gibson on a bloody pulpit preaching to the converted.
2477	4	a	It set the way for how the Hollywood sports biography was to be subsequently made.
2478	3	a	The story alone is enough to almost make you become interested in auto racing.
2479	6	a	Revolutionary Road is content to stick with hoary cliches about the emptiness of middle-class bourgeois life.
2480	0	a	Deeply-felt drama depicting the worst of America and the best of America. David Oyelowo is excellent.
2481	6	a	There's very little tension in The Perfect Score because everything seems to fall into their laps or laptops.
2482	0	a	It's a film of jaw-dropping virtuosity and pleasure, one that leaves you revved, enthralled, tickled, moved, and amazed.
2483	5	a	Hello, My Name is Doris suffers from the loss of credibility at the end.
2484	6	a	Falls prey to the defect of all poor road movies: In gluing together unbelievable but convenient episodes with sugary sentimentality, it loses most of its credibility.
2485	5	a	Eat Pray Love is the cure for insomnia. The film is boring and a gigantic advertisement for The Travel Channel, Food Network and Lifetime. 
2486	2	a	The result, an eye-popping strobe of flesh and blood, is as visually stunning as it is absurdly offensive, sure to thrill some while leaving others in a state of outrage-induced catatonia.
2487	6	a	What could have been a sharp-tongued satire ends up an overlong, uneven, self-aggrandizing misfire.
2488	0	a	This thought-provoking science fiction is most interesting for the protean ideas which came to full bloom six years later in Star Wars.
2489	2	a	Simply by being a typical, if entertaining, high school movie, it may be making its most important statement of all. 
2490	6	a	Frenetic, forgettable and unfulfilling. Even Will Smith looks uncharacteristically uncomfortable.
2491	3	a	It's both ridiculous and ridiculously romantic, which is an apt description of a work shaped like a heart and structured like a pretzel.
2492	4	a	The film is lean, but not mean, and entertains, mostly, from beginning to end.
2493	3	a	Oh bother, as Winnie the Pooh would say; this is not the live action over-the-top film kids and adults may expect; however, it is true to the laid-back nature of the books.
2494	4	a	The first half of this film is great entertainment, and then it starts to unravel, but not before Chan establishes himself as a dynamic comedian.
2495	4	a	It's soulful and unslick, and that's apparently just what [Aniston] has always needed to grow into a movie career.
2496	4	a	Director Moorhouse co-wrote with her husband P.J. Hogan, the brains behind the lean, sleek Muriel's Wedding, but this effort seems tone-deaf by comparison.
2497	6	a	The film is undistinguished visually. Worse, it isn't especially funny.
2498	5	a	Add the gifted German director, who deservedly won the Oscar for Lives of Others, to the long list of foreigners lured by Hollywood into making big-budget, high-concept, star-driven movie and fell flat on their faces with their first project.
2499	1	a	[An] intricate and tender movie.
2500	7	a	The film goes from bad to hilarious in a few spots, but for the most part it's just loud and plodding. 
2501	3	a	Here is a film that shuns conventions expected in coming-of-age stories and romances but never at the expense of universal emotions felt by anyone who has ever been in love.
2502	9	a	This four-hour fiasco is shapeless and dramatically inert.
2503	3	a	It looks like Pixar, but plays like Monty Python.
2504	4	a	Silly teens-versus-aliens adventure is sure to delight kids.
2505	4	a	This film is visually beautiful. But in terms of content it is flat and boring. It is very nice, tender and well acted, but that's it. [Full review in Spanish]
2506	3	a	I have no basis from which to judge [Firefly's] big-screen incarnation Serenity except as a stand-alone movie, and in that respect it works quite well.
2507	1	a	While I admired and enjoyed the film, it reminded me of drinking a Pepsi Throwback; tastes great but brings nothing new to the table. 
2508	5	a	I needed to take a shower after just watching the film.
2509	3	a	Hoffman brings all the methodical excellence that has made him such a force as an actor to his first outing as a director with the tender story of awkward, middle-aged love, betrayal and consequences in Jack Goes Boating.
2510	5	a	Inches toward melodrama and dramatic overcrowding, weakening a previously intimate study of curiosity.
2511	3	a	Irony piled upon irony as a straight, dull man pretends to be gay and becomes more alive.
2512	4	a	Could easily have been produced as a Tony-winning stageplay but as cinema, it never strives to achieve the heights of even the lowest of Cronenberg milestones.
2513	6	a	Roll Bounce wants to be everything, but the mish mash of styles and tones yields a movie that falls short of its potential.
2514	3	a	A solid, vibrant family film that parents and young-ish nippers can enjoy together.
2515	0	a	Hawks directs the film with his typical assurance and seeming lack of fuss, letting scenes play out in long takes, and framing the action against vistas that often dwarf the actors.
2516	6	a	An all-but-incomprehensible supernatural action mish-mash in which Vin Diesel plays an immortal modern-day witch hunter... A passable time killer that will lose nothing once it hits the vending machines.
2517	5	a	The final product quite amiable nonsense.
2518	6	a	Anne doesn't drive her own journey. She spends scene after scene passively letting Jacques tell her what to do, eat and think. And there's no detouring around that.
2519	0	a	If Berg's movie were a newspaper story, it would win the Pulitzer Prize for public service.
2520	4	a	Gives us a super-creepy performance by Willem Dafoe, some very cool atmosphere, a unique style of direction and an okay story.
2521	4	a	Bateman, whose name is usually mud when it comes to appearing in good movies, brings out the best in Smith the actor and the action becomes surprisingly fresh and funny. 
2522	0	a	Wonderful stuff.
2523	4	a	The set-up is slow and weak, but once it gets rolling, it works pretty well.
2524	9	a	An awful film, certainly, but also undeniably watchable.
2525	6	a	Whatever were they smoking?
2526	0	a	Qualifies as a cinematic event by tapping into the roots of Eminem and the fury and feeling that inform his rap.
2527	5	a	Rarely clever misfire comedy with Garr and Jones.
2528	9	a	Imagine Reservoir Dogs, re-cut as a completely linear film, then stripped of its snappy dialogue, innovative shot design and compelling characters.
2529	5	a	"Kevin Costner scowls and darts around the dubious thin line between ""racism"" and un-sugarcoated ""truthfulness"" that only anti-P.C. wingnuts actually believe exists. "
2530	3	a	Grant's antics are hysterical.
2531	8	a	Impossible to follow and flat-out boring.
2532	4	a	Erik Gandini's documentary indicts Italy's prime minister for controlling the lion's share of TV stations and magazines but less convincingly connects the dots between the PM's media empire and his political power.
2533	2	a	... prehistory was presented as an inexhaustible source of raw material for the visual gag... [Full review in Spanish]
2534	9	a	As the umpteenth computer-animated film released this year, it must contend with an over-saturated marketplace. That's one strike. The second strike is that it's not any good.
2535	1	a	Most biopics mistakenly try to take us from cradle to grave and end up skimming the surface. The wisdom of Cobb is that writer-director Ron Shelton knows that the close study of a single day can decode a human life.
2536	6	a	Elicits a handful of smiles but not many laughs as it approaches a finale that comes as a foregone conclusion.
2537	4	a	Lacking the interesting characters and intriguing subplots that made the earlier trilogy so engaging, The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey is too flat, too slow.
2538	6	a	Big chunks of the film are devoted to the idea that it's hilarious to watch guys in fancy costumes bicker and play volleyball, but that sort of thing is amusing for about a minute.
2539	6	a	"The ""problems"" enumerated in ""Don't Know"" will look like appealing luxuries to many folks."
2540	9	a	Those looking for an evening's diversion will find it an amateur exercise that has the feel of a film-school project.
2541	5	a	Teller is appreciably committed to the character, but he's only given one note to play, his full-bodied passion wasted on a movie that would rather win on points than go for the knockout.
2542	4	a	A better than fair attempt at the 'modern' sword and sorcery genre.
2543	3	a	Not for everyone - there will be heated debate about at least one plot turn - but high-level filmmaking. The year's classiest horror movie.
2544	0	a	This Steven Spielberg thriller remains one of his best films and one of the best summer blockbusters of all time.
2545	3	a	Director Alex Proyas lays on the Tomorrowland awe of shiny metallics, techno-worship and fascist efficiency that make the future look like a nice place to visit.
2546	4	a	...with more attention paid to shock than to storytelling, the violence and incredulity take the front seat...
2547	6	a	Tupac: Resurrection gives us a little bit of both but, more than that, leaves us with the impression that Tupac Shakur had a lot more left to say.
2548	2	a	If you're on the lookout for something in the indomitable human spirit category, look no further than Mao's Last Dancer.
2549	6	a	Can easily be an inspirational, feel good movie if you let it--as long as you abandon any hope for originality.
2550	2	a	Even Martin Sheen is keepin' it real.
2551	2	a	Over-produced, overlong and too violent for young children, but it isn't lacking in marvelous special effects, occasional magic and general entertainment value.
2552	1	a	One of the most sexually daring films to hit the screens in the U.S. since 'Last Tango in Paris.'
2553	4	a	Uneven, but mildly diverting at times.
2554	5	a	It's the lamest idea for a romantic comedy in recent memory, as well as one of the sorriest star vehicles in ages.
2555	6	a	Starts well with dippily exciting action and daft dialogue, but outstays its welcome as it devolves into a deeply daft Ocean's Eleven riff.
2556	3	a	It's a disciplined voyage into madness, perhaps not Almodovar's most triumphant piece of work, but a film that most certainly needs to be seen to be believed.
2557	3	a	Woman on the Beach is a bittersweet accounting of the geography of desire.
2558	3	a	Milla Jovovich and Michelle Rodriguez kick zombie butt in this faithful, action-packed adaptation of the popular survival horror video game.
2559	3	a	If you like Westerns, you'll love Silverado.
2560	2	a	[Klapisch] lets Xavier's year abroad unfold with the right wandering touch of pleasure, nostalgia, and wistful exploration.
2561	5	a	A self-reflective melodrama about filmmaking and revenge.
2562	6	a	Strange movie. And despite the presence of Tina Fey playing its lead character, a cable-TV reporter named Kim Baker, it's not a funny one.
2563	2	a	The plot twists and turns are genuine John le Carre and, I have to admit, I did not see the end coming. And neither did Gunther. 
2564	1	a	[Apatow] dampens any impending slapstick with his brilliant, deceptively ragged dialogue; the situations live and breathe via his finely tuned talk.
2565	0	a	Sound too bleak? For some, perhaps. But in McDonagh's careful hands, it's a Cirque du Soleil-like tightrope walk, gracefully balancing the harrowing with the humorous.
2566	3	a	It's a bruiser alright and whether you're already familiar with this remarkable sporting fable turned fact or not, Bleed For This delivers a real knockout emotional blow.
2567	1	a	It's a lovely, streaming, ceremonial movie, a little hard to totally accept if you have questions about the sort of love that requires testing by lethal blades.
2568	6	a	Provides quite a few moments of fun and pathos for audiences who appreciate sophisticated family fare.
2569	4	a	A highlight of Phoenix's career
2570	4	a	Anderson had long wanted to adapt Pynchon--this marks the first movie to do so. Is it successful? That depends on what you demand from an L.A. detective mystery.
2571	6	a	A bizarre, mixed up mess, but one with good moments courtesy of a solid supporting cast.
2572	3	a	Powerful, tragic true story has heavy themes.
2573	1	a	Terrence Malick's Days of Heaven is a landmark film in that it is one of the few movies ever made that has no discernable weaknesses.
2574	2	a	A cute and silly trifle, a sugary confection that will not linger long on the palate after you've left the theatre.
2575	6	a	Energetic and slickly done, but also somewhat soulless.
2576	3	a	The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey is a lot like that beat up car you have sitting in the driveway. It doesn't always accelerate when it should, but once it gets going it's more reliable than anything.
2577	1	a	Carol is a movie worth watching to understand its main theme without fear of censorship, and most of all, to realize and understand that love is love regardless of genre. [Full Review in Spanish]
2578	0	a	Without diminishing the deep transcendentalist yearnings of its young hero, Into the Wild builds to a climax of profound human connectedness, profound human pain.
2579	3	a	It has the same punchy energy, the same defiant pessimism, and there's nothing around like this. This sequel was a high-wire act, but Boyle has made it to the other side.
2580	4	a	Although the relationship between Oliver and Jennifer remains one of the best ever produced, [it] lacks excitement and tension that are primary ingredients for any movie.
2581	6	a	Had there been a little more fun here, it would have been a great nostalgic blast.
2582	1	a	Eastwood continues to churn out one unique, challenging film after another.
2583	2	a	What transfixes here isn't the labyrinthine plotting -- we're almost overly familiar with that by now -- but Mara's Lisbeth, surely one of the most incendiary antiheroines in all of cinema
2584	6	a	The engaging cast in Country Strong helps us almost forget about Shana Feste's disappointing script and irrational ending. 
2585	3	a	Even if it's not classic noir, this high tension, fast-paced film about an extremely unsympathetic character is still entertaining.
2586	2	a	Peak Grier, Coffy is a sobering story kept at street level, and while Hill keeps the film in the realm of pulp fantasy, the stakes are high.
2587	2	a	It's witty, clever and pushes the technical limits of computer animation but it's as much an imitator as it is an innovator.
2588	4	a	Despite the voiceover, Padilha has created a shocking insight into a world in which corrupt cops slug it out against drug dealers but, ultimately, nobody wins.
2589	3	a	I had never felt such Darwinian satisfaction before seeing the progeny of Hanks and Wilson.
2590	7	a	Every ounce of The Angry Birds Movie is a mimicry and mockery of something greater that came before it. 
2591	5	a	On TV, Everybody Loves Raymond. On the big screen, Nobody will.
2592	4	a	The caliber of the acting by Costner, Spencer and Anthony Mackie is better than the script deserves. 
2593	3	a	The tearjerker of the year.
2594	3	a	The spacious but authentic location shots set the mood for the danger that awaits the two innocents.
2595	4	a	A wonderful homage to the Westerns of old, with some hip, contemporary twists.
2596	2	a	A thoughtful and wonderfully cringe-inducing body horror story, Contracted is an often frightening and nasty exploration of isolation and desperation that grabs hold from the start and doesn't let up until the film's bitter conclusion.
2597	3	a	That The Incredibles is so polished and assured comes as no surprise. The question is, will Pixar's formula ever get old?
2598	3	a	Wonderland may not be the feel-good movie of the year; in fact it feels pretty lousy most of the time. But it offers a dark story well-told with some truly fine performances.
2599	5	a	A poorly written and disappointingly animated adventure that may keep the wee'uns happy for a while but will leave the adults snoozing.
2600	6	a	We learn absolutely nothing about the ideologies of these people or their reasons for fighting. They are virtually interchangeable...
2601	2	a	It has a lot of heart and a lot of action.
2602	6	a	Simply banal, unless you are renovating a house and can identify with the chill that comes from signing all those expensive change orders.
2603	6	a	Once things get going, you might wonder why they didn't just call it Hannibal: First Blood.
2604	9	a	Honestly, you find yourself rooting against Payne's survival, even with a good actor in the hollow role. There's nothing inside the film's sour, slovenly spirit of vengeance.
2605	1	a	...reminds one of how special animation can be.
2606	4	a	A bit shapeless as a story but relies on the charm of Rogen and a few big set pieces to connect the dots.
2607	4	a	Comes complete with a reassuringly gynecologic capper.
2608	6	a	The plot doesn't quite throw up as much moving drama as it should. 
2609	3	a	The first big-screen adventure for the Star Trek: The Next Generation cast...
2610	3	a	An urgent, thought-provoking and timely history movingly brought to life.
2611	1	a	"Everything about ""Get on Up,"" a provocatively structured and unusually rich musical biopic, is a little better, a little less formula-bound, a little sharper than the average specimen in this genre."
2612	3	a	It's hard not to get drawn in as director David Koepp steadily ratchets up the tension and Depp piles on the weird little flourishes. ...warped fun
2613	4	a	It is great to once more be whisked back to Tolkien's extraordinarily vivid world, but Jackson's overstuffed film proves that it is possible to get too much of a good thing. 
2614	6	a	It's tamer than you would expect - and hope.
2615	0	a	Chock full of intriguing twists and turns, plus many memorable musical numbers, this instant Disney classic is a pleasant escape that's fun for young and old.
2616	0	a	A cold, rough look at the dissolution of just about everything. It will bother you afterward. It should.
2617	4	a	Yes, it's as preposterous as it sounds -- possibly even more so -- but the rampant hooey is kept stylish and relatively fleet-footed by director Breck Eisner.
2618	4	a	Easily the best of the series, [it] blends serious fright with funny situations ... as in the deaths that occur at the Phoenix Tanning salon.
2619	4	a	Clearly there was a publicity hound somewhere inside the coach when he made his lockout a TV spectacle, but the movie avoids any such interesting shadows.
2620	3	a	With characters that don't belong in the film and resolutions that seem mere fantasy, Mystic River never surpasses adequacy.
2621	5	a	Basically, Vantage Point is a don't-ask-and-we-won't-tell movie. We are just supposed to sit back and ride along without questioning where we are being driven.
2622	0	a	It's a cornerstone of the French New Wave, and one of the greatest movies about childhood, from anywhere, ever.
2623	4	a	Schwarzenegger has enough inherent charm and likeability that he's better off when he just lets the story pull him along, as he does here.
2624	8	a	If you can't say anything nice, don't say anything at all, right?
2625	4	a	... the resonance of the mythic imagery and potential of the premise creates a fascinating film in the margins of the pulp story in the foreground.
2626	3	a	a roller-coaster of special effects as Ray and his family escape from ever more hair-raising dangers in ever more improbable, but oddly fun ways.
2627	4	a	There are problems here, but they're of the good-natured variety -- the flaws of a smart film that aims high.
2628	4	a	What's most disappointing here is that Kevin James appears capable of far more rich and subtle comedy than he's ever likely to be part of in a Happy Madison production.
2629	3	a	An emotionally rewarding reunion tour for established fans and a taut, sharp-tongued, character-driven thriller for all, Veronica Mars makes a compelling case for its heroine's continued existence.
2630	4	a	It's shallow, predictable and completely overblown, but it's also good-natured and reasonably fun.
2631	5	a	It's not brilliant, it's rather predictable, but it's ok; it bowls along nicely and it does make you jump. What more can you ask of dinosaurs?
2632	6	a	For me, Seth MacFarlane is a bit like the Ron Paul of comedy, with three good ideas for every one REALLY bad one, three genuinely funny gags to one so bad it makes me groan until I start to see flashy things in my field of vision.
2633	5	a	Dull, faltering fantasy/action feature that might work better as a video game.
2634	4	a	Suggests the surreal, almost post-narrative horror movies of Dario Argento, Lucio Fulci and other directors who favor the emotional impact of bold, grotesque imagery over story logic.
2635	6	a	The movie is rigged for payoffs more linear than the Parthenon in its prime.
2636	1	a	A marvel of filmmaking wizardry and engrossing adventure storytelling, The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey marks another triumph by director Peter Jackson who once again takes J.R. Tolkien's words and brings them to life with skilful, passionate expertise.
2637	2	a	Obviously, this is emotionally rich ground and Garcia plows it perhaps a bit too heavily.
2638	6	a	Though it's good to see [Stiller] back in his stumbling, bumbling element, it's a bummer to see his element wasted in such stumbling, bumbling gags.
2639	4	a	For better and for worse, this is a movie where you can truly say that fans have gotten everything they've paid for.
2640	3	a	An affecting character study, anchored by scraped-bare and often heartbreaking performances by Laura Linney and Gabriel Byrne.
2641	1	a	Beneath the beautiful surface and indulgence of Sorrentino's The Great Beauty, there is an insightful, intriguing satire about what it means to create art that elevates itself beyond shallow eye candy.
2642	4	a	It's very derivative...and takes a long time to get going. But it does just about get there, helped by attractive lead performances from Amandla Stenberg and Harris Dickinson and a refreshingly 'colour-blind' take on adolescent love.
2643	2	a	Director Dean Parisot is willing to go more than ten seconds between gags. While this reduces the number of laughs, it substitutes quality for quantity.
2644	5	a	Somehow securing cinematic distribution when its script, plot and execution scream straight-to-DVD, Armoured is the worst kind of B-movie: a dull one.
2645	3	a	It is a romantic comedy, released for Valentine's weekend no less, that is willing to look at the darker underside of dating
2646	1	a	A cinematic phantasmagoria, this film is a movie lover's wet dream.
2647	3	a	For me, Ferrara and Keitel will always be the bad lieutenant, but Werner Herzog is probably the only director qualified to take this on, and his bizarre reboot has a fascination all of its own.
2648	5	a	Invictus hits all the right formula notes of both the biopic and the underdog sports movie, making it impossible to hate. He also hits those notes so insistently and with such a lack of grace that he makes it a difficult movie to like.
2649	3	a	Certainly the best first film ever by a musician crossing over to the acting world.
2650	3	a	The film remains one of Pixar's finest moments. It's unexpectedly dark in tone, and, with its underlying theme of mortality and abandonment, it's perceptively written and superbly animated.
2651	4	a	Kendrick rises above some predictable material here, but director Nathan Hope does at least infuse the film with some genuine frights and keeps things moving at a clippy pace
2652	7	a	The mark of a good actor is being good in a really bad movie. Josh Brolin is a really, really good actor, because most of the time he's on screen speaking you can almost forget what a loathsome, irredeemable, turd of a film Jonah Hex is.
2653	4	a	Mars Needs Moms dares to venture into some sad, tragic territory which, in a perverse way, made the film a bit more enjoyable and prevented it from being completely underwhelming
2654	4	a	Laughs occasionally ensue.
2655	9	a	"That right. Within moments of ""fade in,"" the president of the United States is ordering that children be caged. I swear to God. The dystopian future is now."
2656	0	a	It's almost impossible not to smile while watching it.
2657	2	a	An action-drama that's fascinating for its insights into Rio's social structures. But while it's compellingly intense, it's also morally muddled.
2658	6	a	Talk about setting the bar too low, especially in a movie that kids will be watching.
2659	9	a	A desperately unfunny mix of romantic and gross-out comedy.
2660	1	a	To call Carol a Christmas miracle feels like a gaudy understatement, but that's sort of exactly what it is. 
2661	4	a	Just like with the first film, the action sequences are stronger than the actual story.
2662	3	a	With a bit better plot and character familiarity, Fast Five is more fun than the original and now ranks - at least in this critic's opinion - as the best of the bunch.
2663	6	a	Something we've seen before.
2664	4	a	The characters never connect, and the movie never takes off. Rae may be the one sporting a padlock around her waist. But it's the movie that's shackled.
2665	1	a	This is one of those great documentaries which could be transposed almost without change into a heartbreaking Hollywood tearjerker.
2666	2	a	"A more accurate and representative title might have been ""Remaking Woodstock"" because that's clearly what Lee set out to do."
2667	3	a	A well made film that left me emotionally cold.
2668	0	a	How refreshing it is that Enchanted gently makes fun of Disney tradition while upholding it at the same time. There are no cheap or vulgar jokes, and sentiment never turns to treacle.
2669	3	a	A pleasing puzzle of feuding conjurers played by Christian Bale and Hugh Jackman.
2670	5	a	Maybe he's also Sam. Or an aspect of Sam. Or else Sam is an aspect of Henry. Maybe Henry is an aspect of Lila. Maybe what we think is reality is all an illusion. Maybe illusion is actually reality. Maybe we're all jacked into the Matrix.
2671	3	a	Mendes distills the Bond ethos in a single sequence: it's sex and death as irresistible surface and sheen.
2672	5	a	Overwrought, way too long, and rife with emotional implausibilities, the film comes very close to being an affront to the memory of the victims of these real-life catastrophes, because very little in it comes very close to being real.
2673	0	a	A story of desperation and revenge as darkly funny as it is tragically bleak, Three Billboards expertly undermines expectations, pushing characters far beyond their traditional archetypes.
2674	2	a	Smith, of course, is so cool he can afford to pretend to be uncool; but what really works for him here is the interplay with James, whose inner-wild-man dance moves alone are worth the price of admission.
2675	10	a	Too many canine-faced munchkins and Lovitz-Garr shenanigans do not a comedy make, folks.
2676	4	a	cheerful comedy, well-played by Parton
2677	0	a	A movie that's loving and wistful and often hysterically funny.
2678	0	a	This is definitely a for-the-femmes flick with its story of romance, elegant dialog, fine chemistry between stars Whitshaw and Cornish and outstanding production design, lensing and costume.
2679	6	a	A sometimes-amusing moron.
2680	5	a	How desperate is Columbus if his creepy spiders look, act, and sound just like the Eight Legged Freaks
2681	1	a	Inventiveness taken to new levels...simply a marvel.
2682	9	a	It's so ludicrous in so many different ways it achieves a kind of forlorn grandeur.
2683	3	a	It's still a 'check your brains at the door' action entry, but as a thrill ride it, sets the high bar for the summer's releases.
2684	5	a	It's all very complicated and makes one lose interest quickly.
2685	4	a	Frivolous entertainment which only works because of Hartnett.
2686	2	a	"It's funny, dramatic, even heroic: ""The Incredibles"" largely lives up to its name. But you'll still leave the film feeling that Pixar left something on the table."
2687	4	a	The movie has a relaxed pace, which is appropriate as characters learn that their everyday worries aren't as important as human connections.
2688	6	a	It's interesting in how very dated it has become, but all of that interest is extra-textual.
2689	6	a	The storytelling is mostly linear, with some confusing back-and-forth in the chronology, and it's a long slog. The Brown who emerges from this film has a monstrous ego to go with his monster talent.
2690	6	a	What's missing, especially in an era when we've invested so much hope for extraterrestrial life by sending real probes to the real Mars, is a sense of wonder.
2691	6	a	The film never really regains the opening scene's momentum.
2692	3	a	The torment is captured well enough in the faces of the actors, their characters locked inside an indifferent, inhospitable world.
2693	3	a	There are some mighty fine laughs in this clever Claymation cartoon from the creator of England's hilarious Wallace and Gromit movies.
2694	3	a	ABSCAM comes alive in this stereotype drenched, pratfall ridden but entertaining story of good people lost in the American promise.
2695	9	a	It squanders eminently watchable stars Quaid and Stone on a script where any sense of mystery and suspense are corrupted by contrivance.
2696	1	a	"Extra Man"" is a loving ode to the eccentrics of New York, and a wish that even in today's Disneyfied Manhattan, the city will always make room for the weirdos, too."
2697	9	a	Achieves a rare form of badness.
2698	1	a	If you're looking for a crime story that sizzles with action, sex and the visceral jolt of life on the edge, Miami Vice is the one.
2699	6	a	To say that Welcome to Mooseport plays like a lost episode of TV's Northern Exposure does not do justice to that show.
2700	1	a	A determinedly offbeat romance and rather knowing portrait of self-destructive behavior.
2701	6	a	Owen Wilson is perilously close to doing a Dupree on his own career, by wearing out his welcome.
2702	3	a	This is the first romantic comedy I've seen in a long time that, by the third act, doesn't forget about being funny.
2703	3	a	It's not just child's play for the holidays; it's a movie about how to be truly happy in a tough world
2704	4	a	Way closer to being a Real World movie than The Real Cancun was.
2705	4	a	Gothic frights and supernatural spookiness make this a stylish guilty pleasure.
2706	3	a	It's filled with bumps and scratches. But in the manner of a nicked old LP, its gnarly surface and warps-and-all sound evokes real life.
2707	4	a	I love the work that deNiro and Lawrence do here, but ultimately all they do is prove the old adage that you can cover up a lot of problems with the script by hiring good actors. 
2708	8	a	The new Phoenix lacks the very things that made the old one special.
2709	9	a	The film bulls-eyes so-bad-it's-sad from the get-go. The precision with which it just keeps hitting that unwanted target is spooky.
2710	2	a	Sequel isn't quite hog heaven, but it's meaty enough.
2711	4	a	The Roger Moore Bond days are drawing to close, as this weak entry shows.
2712	3	a	It's worth it just to see a ready-made Superman-sized superhero in action without all the baggage of decades of retellings and reworkings; even looking at familiar faces working through a familiar genre, it's nice to be surprised for once.
2713	5	a	So busy trying to look steely and hip that it forgets to engage us on any other level.
2714	7	a	Casa de los Babys is probably the biggest misstep of [Sayles's] long career
2715	5	a	Simply a tired, predictable retread of plot snippets and hollow characters from previous Hughes productions.
2716	2	a	Ultimately this is a movie built around Moore's performance, and she doesn't disappoint.
2717	1	a	The cinematic equivalent of a full-bore panic attack, sweaty palms, rapid heartbeat, and all.
2718	4	a	Proof that an old genre can still have life as long as filmmakers are willing to fill it with energy, humor and respect for the genre.
2719	3	a	Speaks powerfully to audiences with its potent blend of extraordinary performances and engaging soundtrack.
2720	4	a	If you are a connoisseur of the Steven Seagal flavor of direct-to-DVD action film, seeing all these guys up on screen actually is a lot of fun. It doesn't make it a good movie by any stretch of the imagination, but it's still a lot of fun.
2721	2	a	Has a burnished feminine sadness, and the director, Julian Jarrold, gives it a creamy-dark visual flow.
2722	3	a	"Teller is cornering a market on recklessness in the roles he chooses -- the energy from that demonic drum solo at the end of ""Whiplash"" seems to carry over into the ferocity with which Vinny pounds at life."
2723	3	a	Toplined by Johnny Depp, who's in great form, Rango is a thematically witty, visually striking animated Western, a movie that could be enjoyed by younger and mature viewers in different ways.
2724	4	a	The ending fizzles... war should end in a victory that you can feel superior about and celebrate. It's close, but this encounter didn't rock my world.
2725	3	a	A sweetly old-fashioned romance about a young man who falls in love over email... with another young man. Tender, funny, sometimes heartbreaking, enormously human and honest.
2726	6	a	"Identity Thief"" is mostly noteworthy for reminding us that McCarthy's talents can, indeed, carry a comedy. It's too bad that it had to be this one."
2727	4	a	Like its title character, Alfie is a touch too immature to ever fully win you over.
2728	0	a	An unforgettable coming-of-age comedy that's sweet, witty, and brings back the joys of being young and full of life. 
2729	2	a	"The World's End"" mines humor from the prospect of hapless, decidedly unsober fellows confronted with the potential end of life as we know it. When the movie is funny, it's very funny ..."
2730	3	a	A spirited irreverence about the power of death pervades. Think of this as a relief valve compared to most of Hitchcock's other films.
2731	3	a	"Charming"" and ""sweet"" are two words that can be applied to this movie, which is considerably gentler than the R-rating might imply."
2732	6	a	The film makes no real impression; it's amiable, occasionally funny and indistinguishable from dozens of other romantic comedies just like it.
2733	7	a	Distinct from its various narrative failings, this DC comic book adaptation is most notable for how skimpy and curiously under-sketched it feels.
2734	3	a	As the familiar cat-and-mouse plot unfolded, I let myself enjoy the unapologetic masculine thrills.
2735	3	a	A poignant tale of a person who just wants to be happy, to live in freedom, to be herself. 
2736	7	a	like a plus-size episode of Sliders.
2737	3	a	As brave as it is affecting.
2738	3	a	The movie's heart and story, both bleeding and mending, and its quartet of characters are hard to abandon -- and easy to care about.
2739	0	a	Employs a remarkable range of talent in a story of wonderful comic invention and surprising dramatic depth.
2740	1	a	Its real power comes from Hill's potent pulp storytelling and up-front style as well as the novelty of a female hero who takes charge and controls her own destiny. 
2741	5	a	The film fizzles rather than fizzes.
2742	6	a	There are some hearty laughs to be had, but they don't come frequently enough.
2743	4	a	It should be seen, not for the movie itself, but for the way it has been made.
2744	2	a	In expressing his own blend of masochism and piety, Mel Gibson may well have created a Jesus uniquely apt for our time: bloodied, tormented, alienated and alone.
2745	0	a	A surprising near-masterpiece, and the best Western to come across the range since Clint Eastwood's Unforgiven and Jim Jarmusch's Dead Man.
2746	5	a	Extremely disturbing and unnecessarily violent.
2747	2	a	Delivers pretty much exactly what its audience wants and expects: big, dumb, campy fun so deliriously, comically macho, it's remarkable that no one in the cast died of testosterone poisoning. 
2748	1	a	A fun, offbeat, and mildly subversive comedy ... with unexpected twists and ... a real sense of danger.
2749	4	a	Benefits from its confidence in the page-turning pull of its random, breathless plotting, which borrows as much from 'Nancy Drew' as from John Hughes.
2750	2	a	...people are allowed to change their minds
2751	3	a	A deeply humane look at the way the shards of a broken family unit can be reconfigured into something warm, positive and functional.
2752	4	a	Cry Freedom is a sincere and valuable movie, and despite my fundamental reservations about it, I think it probably should be seen.
2753	4	a	Animation veterans Fergal Reilly and Clay Kaytis ensure this Skittles-coloured universe is never less than zippy. But it's the cast that makes the movie.
2754	7	a	While the ingredients are there for this game to be a memorable one, I'm afraid this latest film about Turing fails its own test, feeling robotic and wooden.
2755	4	a	In a tour de force of unassuming verbal and physical comedy, Paul Rudd has given us the big screen's first answer to Arrested Development's Michael Bluth.
2756	4	a	It's possible to experience a few white knuckle moments without being in danger of catching frostbite.
2757	3	a	It is so focused on the depravity at its heart that watching it is like subjecting yourself to a nightmare that sucks the air slowly from your lungs.
2758	3	a	It is a romantic comedy in the best classic Hollywood style, albeit one with some sharp writing and genuinely human as well as funny moments.
2759	4	a	May also be yet another example of a book that was just fine as a book -- that didn't need to be made into a film.
2760	10	a	Offensive in almost every way, it's the Billy Lynn's Long Halftime Walk of Predator movies.
2761	5	a	Writer-director Jed Weintrob is so busy trying to make important statements about human relationships in the cyber age that he loses control of his whiny, unlikable characters.
2762	3	a	You wouldn't necessarily want to be Valentino, but this sprightly film may make you nostalgic for a life you've never lived.
2763	2	a	For all its last-act problems, the picture's stylishness, genuinely unsettling atmosphere and spectacular lead performances make it an enjoyably creepy thrill-ride.
2764	5	a	Mostly the same bad joke over and over.
2765	9	a	The latest movie featuring Chris Farley and David Spade really stinks. Oh...wait...
2766	3	a	The film is basically Ocean's Fourteen starring a multiculti version of the cast of Jersey Shore.
2767	4	a	Enchanted bubbles over with good cheer, due in large part to Adams for the wide-eyed optimism and innocence she brings to her irony-free performance.
2768	3	a	When the plot stops cold for a beauty-pageant performance of exquisite purity, you'll feel like you're watching the most American film of the year.
2769	0	a	"Nebraska"" is a wonderful comedy shot in black-and-white and told in shades of gray."
2770	6	a	There's fun to be had viewing this movie, I can't deny that. But this predator is nowhere near apex.
2771	1	a	Though dark in tone and the bulk of the humor is blacker than a raven's wing at midnight, Boyle's sense of humanity persistently creeps in around the edges.
2772	5	a	The film is entertaining in fits and starts, but it just never quite comes together as a whole.
2773	5	a	Fun but predictable sci-fi comedy
2774	1	a	Matchstick Men is really two movies brilliantly spliced into one, each enriching the other.
2775	3	a	Subtle and elegiac, Coppola's anti-Vietnam War meditation is one of the director's most misunderstood films.
2776	6	a	It would be cheering to report that it's a great movie, but you can't have everything.
2777	5	a	Armored is based on a first-time script which, thanks to a bit of industry hype, became the subject of a bidding war among the studios. Sony won the day. Guys, you were robbed.
2778	7	a	American Psycho has all the trappings of a thoughtful film except profundity -- it's a swimming pool without a deep end.
2779	3	a	Shocking, funny, and socio-politically astute
2780	4	a	A black-cast romantic comedy that derives its humor from character and plot development rather than from cliched notions of race-based uproariousness...
2781	5	a	A pair of mediocre leading men sabotage this otherwise charming chick flick.
2782	6	a	Jack Goes Boating reminded one woman I spoke to of Rocky; I can see it if I squint.
2783	4	a	This Dragon flies, but it never really breathes fire.
2784	5	a	Even with Wilson's considerable charms trying to give [Dupree] depth, you wouldn't ... want to spend two hours with him in a darkened movie theater.
2785	5	a	Poor plot aside, it boasts two stellar performances.
2786	3	a	Cotillard makes for a generic muse, and the grass-is-always-greener theme creaks, but Paris might still be Woody's new Manhattan.
2787	0	a	... a bit like Holden Caulfield, except not nearly so eloquent
2788	3	a	As in their previous comedies, Pegg and Frost play men who refuse to stop acting like boys. But these pint-swilling Peter Pans also know how to work the heart and the brain for belly laughs.
2789	1	a	Regardless of its PG rating, if you are a fan of Jerry Seinfeld's comedy style, then you will probably find a lot to like here. This is an incredibly witty film.
2790	5	a	The film poses ethical dilemmas, but leaves the viewer annoyed when characters continually make foolish decisions.
2791	3	a	Playing outspoken, emotionally damaged young widow Tiffany, Lawrence is a firecracker, a powder keg, a force of nature.
2792	3	a	"Pushes the envelope in the same goodhearted way the first ""American Pie"" did, relying on a pitch-perfect cast of characters to deliver some memorable one-liners."
2793	5	a	Younger's treatment of this inspirational tale is what might be termed a dogged but ultimately rather flatfooted entry in the boxing genre. 
2794	6	a	There's little room for neutral territory with this one. You're either going to love or hate Gladiator.
2795	9	a	When a kidnapping victim escapes from a demented serial killer's hideout, you may want to carefully check the area in which she's found for the aforementioned hideout
2796	1	a	Like a great magician, Nolan makes the pledge, takes the turn and delivers the prestige.
2797	4	a	A psychological thriller in a category by itself.
2798	2	a	Weir's artisan's sureness grants a bewitching calm -- his trademark ambience -- to this harrowing tale.
2799	4	a	Even with Stiller and De Niro, Meet the Parents is an encounter that can be postponed until it's available on video.
2800	4	a	There are fabulous performances from both Jamie Foxx and Robert Downey Jr, it's just that the power of the story of these two men gets lost in the mix.
2801	1	a	Farmiga effectively shows the fear, need and hope at war within Irene, how the false high of being clean for a week can fade when she realizes the second week isn't going to be any easier.
2802	5	a	Misfired attempt at GenX comedy.
2803	6	a	As a romantic comedy, America's Sweethearts is atrocious. As a skewering of Hollywood ego, it's actually quite funny.
2804	3	a	One of the best documentaries of the year.
2805	4	a	There are some sins of overt manipulation here, but in large part due to Matt Damon's ability to make his character's grief real, the movie ultimately succeeds.
2806	3	a	Heartfelt, charming and very, very funny. Plugging into the same fuzzy nostalgia as the Paddington movies, this is a film for kids big and small.
2807	4	a	Nothing that happens later in the movie lives up to the inexorable, thundering, power of the tsunami, which makes the under-imagined images of the afterlife thin and tepid.
2808	2	a	... the most fun to be had at a Woody Allen movie in a long time. 
2809	0	a	Lost in Translation is delicate, heartfelt, and mesmerizing.
2810	0	a	A wildly entertaining, beautiful and hypnotic puzzler from a towering talent, Inherent Vice proves to be so much more than just the best film of the year - though it is that too.
2811	1	a	Heavenly Creatures is dazzling; a perversely original psychodrama.
2812	0	a	Often imitated, never duplicated.
2813	7	a	When Ford finally pulls the trigger, it's a relief as the flick's final ten minutes spin into actually interesting terrain
2814	5	a	There isn't a character here who resembles a real person you might care about.
2815	3	a	One of the best Tracy-Hepburn movies
2816	3	a	Some good bits about the nature of heroism, but not enough to elevate Rango to the ranks of Pixar. Still, when viewed as a silly comedy-adventure, it's enjoyable.
2817	6	a	What should have sizzled fizzles.
2818	4	a	"Kevin Costner's and Octavia Spencer's confrontational scenes are ""Black or White's"" strong suits."
2819	6	a	Apart from Lawrence's goofing, Blue Streak isn't much of a movie and its formula of stunts, anti-authority humor and a chase-and-crash finale is predictable enough to be depressing.
2820	3	a	Chadwick Boseman is absolutely electric as the centrepiece of Tate Taylor's James Brown biopic.
2821	5	a	Following Hitchcock's 'bomb under the desk' dictum to the bitter end just doesn't work out to anyone's satisfaction here.
2822	6	a	What could have been a solid, noirish thriller is bogged down by excessive incidents.
2823	6	a	The special-effects-laden fight scenes are ho-hum, incoherent and badly lit. It's often hard to tell what some warlock or scorpion-like beast is doing and to whom.
2824	3	a	Coppola's mood-setting is pitch-perfect ... to be lost and alone in a strange place, full of strangers, feeling kind of sad and wistful.
2825	3	a	I call the movie a thriller, even though the outcome is known, because it plays like one.
2826	0	a	...a quintessential work of the American Western genre. Brad Pitt gives the best performance of his career...
2827	6	a	worthwhile journey--just didn't blow me away
2828	2	a	Should be seen and absorbed, if only to recall that Hollywood horror does, occasionally, get it more or less right.
2829	6	a	Doesn't leave a lasting impression, despite a story that almost demands discomfort from the viewer. It's never openly engaging, but there's a certain mischief to the piece that pleases.
2830	3	a	Fantastic Four is a popcorn movie that delivers a fluffy, buttery treat
2831	9	a	The final act of The House with a Clock in Its Walls stumbles between awkward, telegraphed jolts and busy, effects-heavy action, completely losing sight of the trauma and grief that was meant to give the film its emotional core.
2832	3	a	A juicy wad of bubblegum entertainment, visually antic and immersive without feeling assaultive, fast-paced without feeling rushed.
2833	4	a	remains frustratingly surface level in its aspirations, taking us through familiar Psycho-related trivia without ever making it truly come alive
2834	3	a	A misguided but visually entrancing film that works better as satire.
2835	4	a	...ultimately unable to wholeheartedly become the feel-good romantic comedy that Russell has clearly intended...
2836	5	a	Boseman is at times mesmerizing, living up to the gargantuan task of playing the American soul legend. If only the movie were as good as he is.
2837	7	a	ignore the propaganda this picture is peddling.
2838	4	a	The movie is sometimes charged with real tension and passion. And yet Close as Nobbs is an absence.
2839	3	a	A male fantasy of rescue from irrelevance...
2840	6	a	If the time-travel gimmick has to be employed twice in a row then it's probably best to banish these characters to a retirement sewer.
2841	1	a	An oddball odyssey so strange, filled with non-sequiturs so funny, and decorated by a romance so sweet, it was an inevitable star-maker.
2842	6	a	It's more dead teenagers and lunatic determinism in this grim third installment of the enjoyably preposterous Final Destination franchise.
2843	5	a	Awful... but under the night sky at an old-school drive-in - or with the appropriate spirit in tow - that awful can be a lot more fun than a good number of its betters. 
2844	3	a	A love story that's told with respect and restraint.
2845	5	a	The Passion is a beautiful film, but an empty one.
2846	6	a	You could condemn such a movie for being such a smirking, calculatedly cheesy gore-fest. But that would presume that the movie aspires to be anything else.
2847	3	a	A bit of a mess but it is such an energetic and ambitious mess that it winds up capturing the energy and feel of its subject better than a more staid approach to the material possibly could have achieved.
2848	8	a	Compared with Jackass, professional wrestling is scripted by Moliere.
2849	0	a	For six hours that seemed more like two, I was wrapped up in a human drama that was also a historical drama and a genuine wonder of filmmaking.
2850	1	a	An unassuming chase thriller by the youngish though not quite so innocent Alfred Hitchcock.
2851	3	a	This is a movie by and for the actors, especially for Kate Winslet, whose prodigious talents are well used throughout this bleak, troubling and powerful drama.
2852	3	a	Guy Pearce excels in a difficult role and Robert Pattinson is believable and entertaining as his partner on this oft-beaten track through a dystopia of our making.
2853	9	a	The most clever aspect of You, Me and Dupree is its rhyming title...after that, it's one long, steep decline into suffering.
2854	4	a	...one of the best films of its genre.
2855	5	a	The script is remorselessly smutty, the one-liners are below average and the giant mechanical spider climax endlessly drawn out, but the wildly inventive gizmos give entertainment value and draw a shield over the numerous flaws.
2856	3	a	One of the most voluptuously beautiful films ever imagined, Munchausen naturally assumes that surrealism is preferable, that through make-believe we find the way to true beliefs.
2857	4	a	Adequately funny and reasonably well-executed, and nothing more.
2858	3	a	A rebellious and creative Ohio teenager tries to forge his own passage from adolescence into manhood in the woods with two buddies.
2859	5	a	The House with a Clock in Its Walls achieves an eerie look, but is fitfully dull in the first two acts. Horror Director Eli Roth foregoes his usual macabre blood and guts for kid-friendly fare.
2860	3	a	Robert Altman's jaundiced eye absolutely twinkles in Cookie's Fortune.
2861	6	a	The Edge of Love is literate and often lovely to look at, but unless you're requesting an off-key bohemian rhapsody, do not go gentle into that good theater.
2862	6	a	The movie's satire is fairly gutless, the bulk of it could be contained in one five-minute Williams monologue and the majority of the running time is taken up with a poorly motivated love story and a ponderous thriller subplot.
2863	9	a	Jishnu Bhattacharjee's innovative cinematography tries to cover-up, but he can't rescue a film that fails to explain its lead's sudden change of character.
2864	1	a	Funny, pungent, and weirdly gripping.
2865	0	a	It just touched on so many different issues like love, the sanctity of marriage, forgiveness, rage, entrapment, loneliness and helplessness.
2866	2	a	[Miss Hepburn and Mr. Tracy] can tote phone books on their heads or balance feathers on their chins and be amusing -- which is about the size of what they do here.
2867	1	a	True to the Valentino prerogative, it's beautiful -- sad, too: a dream life moving into the unknown.
2868	4	a	Factory Girl is an effective evocation of a particular slice of recent history. The film benefits from Miller's turn as Edie, an everything-but-the-kitchen-sink performance that takes the poor girl from the heights and highs of fame to the depths and doom
2869	2	a	Often funny, enjoyable and surprisingly thoughtful.
2870	0	a	Very clever black comedy full of great characters and situations.
2871	1	a	Grownups, your summer smash has arrived.
2872	3	a	It is a keenly observed movie about loss of identity and finding love, in which Brooks serves up funny-ouch humor with slapstick heartbreak.
2873	3	a	Besides, where else can you see Jude Law vomit lightly into his hand and slurp it back up? Not in Sky Captain, lemme tell ya.
2874	6	a	A misshapen, generally misguided, unnervingly simplistic romantic comedy with a spiritual element that means to give viewers pause, but seems far more likely to give them giggling fits.
2875	5	a	Getaway is like Bonnie and Clyde on a bad rerun of Survivor with more spins and twists than a salamander on the canopy of the Amazon rain forest -- except they're in Hawaii. Overall, a better travel commercial than a summer thriller.
2876	4	a	Scream Blacula Scream is a tad more polished than its predecessor but also a tad less fun, with too much time spent on dull or annoying characters.
2877	2	a	The series has made it work with macabre humor and devilishly clever setups.
2878	0	a	"Lost in Translation"" is a movie about almost nothing at all except a tenuous connection between two lost souls."
2879	5	a	This smart movie never seemed smart.
2880	9	a	I couldn't pay anyone to see this movie. Literally.
2881	6	a	This movie is Tarantino on speed, and without focus and style. It is in-your-face and proud of it with no apologies.
2882	6	a	Facing the Giants falls victim to the tell-don't-show brand of filmmaking, in which every character always says exactly what he's feeling and every time a character's flaws are pointed out to him, they are immediately corrected.
2883	1	a	There's something deliciously off-kilter about folding a story about the abuse and genocide of indigenous South American cultures into what amounts to a mismatched buddy comedy.
2884	3	a	"High-spirited, emotional and funny, ""Sound City"" is, of all things, a mash note to a machine. Not just any machine, however, but one that helped change the face of rock 'n' roll."
2885	1	a	A movie overflowing with love and concern for young people, depicting them in all their infuriating, vulnerable complexity.
2886	4	a	Hitch is infinitely preferable to rooting for Jennifer Lopez to find love with her feather duster again or watching Meg Ryan pretend not to age.
2887	4	a	This Sade is hardly a perverse, dangerous libertine and agitator -- which would have made for better drama. He's just a sad aristocrat in tattered finery, and the film seems as deflated as he does.
2888	3	a	Scathing and hilarious.
2889	3	a	Fantastic elements are well-handled by the normally ice-cold realist Lang.
2890	3	a	A strongly constructed and effective drama.
2891	4	a	It quickly becomes a so-so horror thriller that takes us deep into the woods and some other dark places.
2892	2	a	Blue Streak, loaded with fast-paced, car-chase scenes, is no model of subtle or especially witty dialogue but Lawrence brings in the howls whenever he pulls off one of his many impersonations.
2893	1	a	Dave Grohl shares a lot of stories in Sound City, and what's most impressive is that for a first-time filmmaker he tells these tales remarkably well.
2894	1	a	Apatow's dialogue is so good, the undercurrent of his story so inherently sweet, and the performances so engaging, that you surrender immediately.
2895	4	a	It never quite brings everything together into a dramatic whole.
2896	2	a	The picture is itself a winner in most respects, flawed only by an overly rambunctious characterization by Nicolas Cage.
2897	3	a	Satire attracts a tough crowd and is always a challenge to pull off. This one duz, and makes the complexity look easy.
2898	1	a	In a year of terrific performances by leading men, Cumberbatch gets my vote for top honors.
2899	1	a	"If there is something wrong with ""Logan Lucky,"" I simply can't find it."
2900	3	a	In a summer full of cacophony and bluster, It Comes at Night sneaks in and grabs with sharp claws, if you open yourself to it.
2901	2	a	Made so well that all ages can appreciate it.
2902	4	a	"Although Roscoe Jenkins doesn't pretend to break new ground, it makes its ""honor your past"" tale fresh and funny."
2903	3	a	...enough doses of the real world to elevate it above your average romantic-comedy fantasty.
2904	3	a	The performances are solid throughout, and young Hirose's Suzu is an unassuming delight.
2905	0	a	It is about how Hitchcock used, feared and tried to control women.
2906	6	a	In small doses, the movie's outlandish, unapologetic gross-out humor works... Taken in all at once, though, How High can be daunting.
2907	3	a	"The Artist"" should appeal to anyone willing to take a chance."
2908	6	a	The grey area is whether it's Schmidt's fault or the zeitgeist's that the film doesn't resonate even ten seconds past the finish line
2909	4	a	Impressive, but it seems like an awful lot of effort to no real point
2910	3	a	Kilmer and Robert's tender, heartfelt performances give real depth to familiar coming-of-age pangs and pinings.
2911	9	a	"An abortion, and one we can blame on the success of the dimwitted ""Fast and Furious"" hits."
2912	3	a	"Chalamet, a world away from his fine work in ""Lady Bird,"" is a young actor to watch."
2913	8	a	It's as simplistic, reductive, and heavy-handed as Deep Cover was gloriously ambiguous.
2914	1	a	Imbued with a blissful nostalgia for things that can never be recaptured, Lost in Translation is already poised to be one of the best movies of the year.
2915	7	a	Perhaps Seth MacFarlane thought that this would be a Blazing Saddles for a new generation, yet A Million Ways to Die in the West belongs way, way on the other side of the western comedy spectrum. 
2916	0	a	"Selma,"" on top of all of its many other virtues, is an inspiring movie about politics being done right."
2917	0	a	Tarr's uncompromisingly tragic view of the human condition is well supported by a rigorous formal approach, resulting in an austere work of art.
2918	6	a	"to summit up, If you're not in the mood for compelling drama and just want to enjoy a bumpy ride - take yourself to the ""Vertical Limit."
2919	6	a	[T]he movie's inability to make up its mind on an approach sinks it.
2920	2	a	I embraced what Van Sant achieved with his earlier three films, I just can't feel quite that same enthusiasm for this one, even though it's an extremely well-made film.
2921	6	a	On paper, The Tourist sounds like a dream film -- two of the hottest actors alive, in a charmingly frothy romantic crime caper set in one of the most beautiful cities on earth. So why didn't it come alive on screen?
2922	3	a	Smart and remarkably well-plotted.
2923	1	a	The South isn't just in Craig Brewer's heart but underneath his fingernails as well.
2924	1	a	Chris Nolan has firmly established himself as an innovative, A-list director who knows how to tell a story.
2925	3	a	It adheres to a classic British sense of humour, traditional values and warm-hearted storytelling. And yet, simultaneously, it's alive with invention.
2926	6	a	Pure and simple trash masquerading as significance.
2927	5	a	Tone-deaf, sloppily written, and indifferently directed.
2928	4	a	Little kids will probably like most of this movie. The weakness is that larger kids and parents, deputized to escort the little ones, are likely to find a lot of it a little thin.
2929	5	a	Peter Jackson didn't particularly want to direct The Hobbit, and I didn't particularly want to be bored to tears, but there we both were, fulfilling what could only be described as some sort of cinematic murder-suicide pact.
2930	3	a	The absence of moralising and macho posturing gives authenticity and poignancy to the film.
2931	3	a	There is an urgent you-are-there magnetism, each fateful mistake and misstep foreshadowing the group's ultimate demise only adding to the slowly building excitement.
2932	4	a	The comic Force is with Fanboys, a hilarious and heartwarming film about the wondrous powers of movies that last a lifetime.
2933	3	a	Whether it's true or not, this portrait of desperate, determined people surviving blizzards and dust storms and crossing mountains and deserts is a gruff and uplifting celebration of how much people can take and how much they value freedom.
2934	3	a	Robotic cameras are our eyes in Ghosts, taking us into the ship and showing us spectacular sights.
2935	6	a	For diehard Smith fans, the film is likely to come across as an orgy of yuks. For the rest, it's just an orgy of yuck.
2936	3	a	The rare kind of movie that doesn't dumb it down for the kids and won't embarrass grownups who come to see it sans familia.
2937	4	a	Gently paced and delicately played, give this long enough and it becomes a compelling watch that eventually rewards any moral aspirations with a splendid Zatoichi-style scrap that manages to stay its welcome.
2938	3	a	This is as rousing and faithful an adaptation as was possible.
2939	3	a	Gripping documentary, see it with your teens.
2940	1	a	American Hustle is about life as a performance, the ways in which we perceive ourselves and wish to be perceived by others.
2941	0	a	An exceptionally good musical biopic with a sensational performancy by Busey
2942	3	a	Even if parts don't hold up in the daylight, the chill will stick to your bones.
2943	3	a	Fans of the more subversive Wallace and Gromit tales are almost bound to be somewhat disappointed by this safer, more mainstream effort.
2944	3	a	Memorable, sometimes gritty drama about music, friendship.
2945	5	a	City slickers learn once again that country folk are a pack of seething, resentful savages in this sluggish thriller directed by Mike Figgis, whose heart doesn't appear to have been in it.
2946	3	a	Amistad is the kind of movie that makes a tired topic seem fresh and entertaining again.
2947	3	a	Good, old fashioned, escapist entertainment.
2948	9	a	Pure garbage.
2949	4	a	Good, with flashes of very good, overlaid with a particularly thick wash of nostalgia that stubbornly refuses to go obnoxiously cloying. It's a nice film, that's what it is.
2950	3	a	A horror movie for gentlefolk: Its methodical terrors -- memory loss, disorientation -- seem all too likely, especially for mature moviegoers less worried about things that go bump in the night than the fall of night itself, so to speak.
2951	6	a	"...""The Break Up"" may go down with ""Fatal Attraction"" as the worst ""date"" movie of all time."
2952	2	a	Although far-fetched at times, On Line gives us likable enough characters and several laugh out loud moments. Director Jed Weintrob has a distinct visual flair.
2953	4	a	Can a comedy be too funny for its own good? 
2954	3	a	Heartwarming family tale for both kids and adults.
2955	6	a	Somewhere, not so long ago, a documentary was made about the true-life background of this fictional romance.
2956	6	a	A lean and mean exploitation thriller, The Glimmer Man might not be original or memorable, but the goods are delivered with reasonable flair and efficiency.
2957	2	a	"for anyone wondering where the well-made, expertly-acted comedy went to, Roscoe Jenkins is a ""welcome"" return for the cinematic form."
2958	6	a	Feels like we're watching Mr. Rogers run a country. Freeman's Mandela smiles politely and wants everyone to be his neighbor. While that may be real, Eastwood never makes it seem interesting
2959	3	a	Charlize Theron's anguish-in-the-raw is the stuff that Oscars are made of.
2960	2	a	Predictable, but humorous.
2961	6	a	The movie makes its point, and continues to hit you over the head with it.
2962	6	a	The writers not only tackle love lost and found but also some timely topics such as unemployment and the prospect of foreclosure due to underwater mortgages. But they barely skim them, and they come up light on laughs, too.
2963	3	a	A sweet, funny comedy about the perils of being a writer and making a movie. An underrated charmer.
2964	5	a	Fortunately, people will remember these men for their heroic feat, and not for it's tedious cinematic adaptation. [Full Review in Spanish]
2965	6	a	Not as good as Lilo and Stitch or Spirited Away, but worth actually going with the kids.
2966	3	a	Mesmerising.
2967	3	a	Selma could have a major effect beyond the theaters.
2968	3	a	Surprisingly sharp and insightful and often very funny, but with a strong strain of serious drama in the mix. 
2969	3	a	The twosome that sparks most agreeably is Vince Vaughn and Jon Favreau. ... The humor isn't always highbrow, but it works.
2970	5	a	Even [Anna Faris] must recognize that the series has turned into the cinematic equivalent of a flat bicycle tyre -- it starts off with lots of air in it, but can quickly go flat when punctured.
2971	1	a	A witty, thoroughly enjoyable take on what happens when two serious people come in contact with others who are hedonistic.
2972	4	a	While it's not a film to enjoy, it's one adventurous movie-goers may appreciate.
2973	7	a	The script for this comedy is so half-baked that we begin to wonder why it was made at all. Not only is it resolutely unfunny, but it never dips beneath a superficial examination of relationship cliches.
2974	1	a	An elegant serving of comic Seoul food from director Hong Sang-soo.
2975	1	a	"Get on Up"" is loud, proud, funky, soulful, sweaty, emphatic and sometimes a little hard to understand, just like its subject, James Brown."
2976	4	a	A little broken, but worth the viewing.
2977	0	a	McDonagh has, once again, entrusted some of the best actors working today with delivering his words. But while everyone in the film deserves their fair share of praise, it's Sam Rockwell and Frances McDormand who shine brightest.
2978	5	a	There is some excitement to be had. However, it looks like a computer game unwisely made into a movie without the money to do it justice.
2979	7	a	The movie makes it abundantly clear that Roscoe should have gone home again. Unfortunately, what's equally apparent is that you shouldn't go with him.
2980	9	a	A dreadful waste of top talent.
2981	6	a	here are times when RESIDENT EVIL looks unfinished or below its potential
2982	3	a	MacFarlane's ambition is to make us laugh, not make us wonder why we're conscious beings pondering our float through the void. He succeeds for the most part.
2983	6	a	Cholodenko has made a huge mistake in casting Bale and Beckinsale as her leads. While their blandness seems to be appropriate for the characters they're played, neither is very interesting.
2984	3	a	This is a very clandestine way to make a liberal message movie, but it works. You could almost say that it serves up Oscar bait in code.
2985	9	a	Larry Crowne is more than a missed opportunity. It's alarmingly, depressingly out of touch.
2986	5	a	Instead of simply adapting Tolkien's novel, Jackson has opted to use the story as a jumping off point for a convoluted prequel that threatens to do for Middle Earth what George Lucas's Star Wars prequels did for a galaxy far, far away.
2987	9	a	If Lee had actually directed his performers ... Welcome Home Roscoe Jenkins probably would have been a better movie. But frantic flailing isn't consistent forward motion.
2988	6	a	It all just takes so long.
2989	1	a	This is a ghost story where the ghost doesn't really do too much and a character's psychological torment mainly gets inflicted by themselves.
2990	3	a	In his third, most accomplished film, LaBute puts aside the inquiry of misogyny that dominated his previous work and immerses himself in a lighter romantic fable about the collision of fantasy and reality, with a terrific performance from Renee Zelwegger
2991	1	a	An original and memorable work.
2992	5	a	Despite a strong cast, the filmmakers squander a clever premise for a series of unoriginal, cheap jokes.
2993	5	a	Hackneyed and telegraphed, just about elevated to passable by three strong lead performances and notable support by Cherry Jones.
2994	0	a	David Fincher's epic doesn't wallow in nihilistic obsessions, but preached no comforting homily about life's rich pageant either. Life is feel-good in spurts - a series of oddly interconnected, occasionally elating moments that accumulate before death.
2995	3	a	Despite the usual pratfalls, a cute snow job.
2996	5	a	This tired, neutered action thriller won't cause you max pain, but you might wince every now and again.
2997	8	a	The ending, suffice it to say, is one you won't soon forget no matter how much you'll want to.
2998	1	a	There's much to be said for a movie that portrays as much imperfection as life itself and, clearly, Herzog and company have a ball in creating it for us.
2999	4	a	If you don't mind the fluctuation in focus, if the tripwire midsection can get your through the labored last act, Valkyrie will be a solid success.
3000	3	a	A spiritual movie about the eyes, science, reincarnation, and the great mysteries of life.
3001	6	a	Adults, other than the parents...will be hard pressed to succumb to the call of the wild.
3002	1	a	No one can breathe life into a crazed character like Nicolas Cage can.
3003	3	a	Both children and adults will delight in the way the destruction of the pigs' island amplifies the joys of the original game. The effect is an amusing reversal of cultural recognition as the role of the icons expands through reproduction ...
3004	5	a	Vanessa Redgrave and the spectacular locales of Tuscany are the main reasons to tolerate the tepid and predictable story...
3005	4	a	While rarely dull, Whiskey Tango Foxtrot is forever changing direction.
3006	0	a	Truffaut's brilliant debut, one of the seminal works of the New Wave, is a captivating autobiographical chronicle of a troubled youth. 
3007	2	a	A cut above the recent lot of slasher films...it does not feel as if it has to cater to audiences who want every plot point spoon fed to them.
3008	4	a	Herzfeld's marriage of dark humor with graphic violence isn't compatible, and his occasional moral statements about cheapened life stick out like sore thumbs.
3009	5	a	Paul Verhoeven made good movies...when he was in Holland.
3010	0	a	Cumberbatch is not that good-looking, folks. And, his farts do NOT smell like roses. But, with that rant out of my system now, I must say he impresses as Turing. The role seems custom-made. 
3011	0	a	Effectively feeds our senses with the chilling sights and sounds from within the camp to create a completely numbing experience.
3012	6	a	It seems as long as the presidential primary season.
3013	5	a	The script is so weak, so illogical, so bereft of actual humour that it takes the considerable charm of the cast merely to prop it up.
3014	3	a	Enjoyable comedy thriller. Short on believability, but long on entertainment
3015	2	a	While Invictus is certainly representative of the quality we're used to seeing from the four-time Oscar winner, it's not one of his stronger films.
3016	4	a	It Comes at Night is technically accomplished-in fact it looks exactly like a film that made the most of a small budget-and the acting is good within the limitations of the roles.
3017	3	a	Paranoid Park's triumph ... is its aesthetic design.
3018	5	a	Memoirs of a Geisha builds a beautiful garden, then runs an interstate through it to let more people in.
3019	10	a	The shark models have so little movement that at times they seem to be supporting themselves on boats, instead of attacking them. Up until the ludicrous final sequence of the movie, the scariest creature in the film is an eel.
3020	3	a	The film does occasionally lapse into silly slapstick and caricature, but most of the way this is a tough, funny and scary cautionary tale.
3021	4	a	With Eastwood stubbornly determined to make one of the quietest films you'll ever see and Matt Damon restrained like never before, the Hereafter could either leave you thinking...or seriously underwhelmed.
3022	3	a	A clever look at con artists and their games of deception.
3023	0	a	...absolutely wonderful.
3024	10	a	Two weren't enough???
3025	1	a	Capturing the changes a man goes through as he learns about life in the wilds, Never Cry Wolf is very informative, but it is Smith's performance that makes the film a resounding success.
3026	1	a	The dynamic between Craig and Mara in The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo is so sensational, it instantly propels the movie beyond glossy, high-toned pulp into something far more affecting.
3027	5	a	...mainly works as a celebration of very big guns -- one guy walks around with what appears to be a rototiller -- and the sort of holes they can put in living flesh.
3028	2	a	This movie has this same charisma and intelligent comedy as the Hughes films. [Full review in Spanish]
3029	3	a	A remarkable film in many respects, and Zhao works wonders with a non-professional cast.
3030	1	a	A bleakly funny parable that could be titled Between Enemy Lines.
3031	4	a	Running out of steam by this second sequel, but will still please fans
3032	3	a	"Criminal Activities"" is a sneaky, snaky little crime thriller with some pretty impressive plot twists."
3033	3	a	Enchanted manages the trick of recasting sugar spun Disney fairy tales of old into a winning, modern-day comedy. Walt Disney would be impressed.
3034	1	a	Morgan does a magnificent job of getting the viewer's feet wet, splashing them with just enough information to make them eager to discover additional information about these people and events.
3035	3	a	The visually arresting animation is more than enough to compensate when narrative confusion threatens to overwhelm.
3036	7	a	Rolls over and plays dead.
3037	2	a	This quietly intense espionage thriller can be hard to follow due to the sheer density of its info-heavy plotting. That it never becomes an impenetrable experience is all due to Hoffman's immovably centred performance.
3038	3	a	An effective portrait of a life in stasis -- of the power of inertia to arrest development in a dead-end existence.
3039	1	a	It's the proclamation for a crusade against anyone who protects those who prey not just upon the children, but spit all over the teachings that assured us the path to Heaven went right through the Church.
3040	3	a	A totally strange, beguiling, sadly humorous and humorously sad little film that's apt to linger in your memory far longer than many a more immediately impressive work.
3041	0	a	"Cumberbatch Heartbreaking, Brilliant in ""Game."
3042	6	a	It shows that Gwyneth knows the spangly high-powered joys of country music. Too bad that in Country Strong, she's too busy acting out the hysterical and mostly nonsensical sorrows.
3043	0	a	As with all good uses of enchantment, Nurse Betty deposits us, in the end, back where we started -- but different, changed, with new ways of looking.
3044	6	a	Immature, predictable, and annoying.
3045	3	a	Enjoyably quirky black comedy that's clearly destined to become a cult movie amongst the Gothic contingent.
3046	0	a	Powerful social commentary and brilliant filmmaking.
3047	4	a	Succeeds in reintroducing the Looney Tunes name, but fails to capture the imagination and sharpness that defined them originally.
3048	4	a	For all the larking and swiving and the odd orgiastic tableau, The Libertine is an extremely sombre, thoughtful work.
3049	5	a	Is it just me, or is this whole idea on the sick side? Imagine how uncomfortable this jolly little yarn would be for divorced parents and their children.
3050	6	a	Spielberg is the only one who can mess up a Spielberg film.
3051	3	a	Alpha Dog may be more crass exploitation than an earnest attempt at laying out the facts of a crime, but it's exciting and watchable for anyone willing to romp in the mud for two hours.
3052	5	a	Bright and cheerful, but under-plotted and overproduced. 
3053	4	a	Glories in over-the-top, testosterone-driven action and an ensemble whose names I only expected to hear when I died and went to B-movie heaven. If only The Expendables' script was as divine as its roll call.
3054	3	a	the film improves as it goes on, especially in the second half, where Spielberg generates a successful tension in juxtaposing action taking place simultaneously within the real world and the OASIS
3055	3	a	The Artist never feels like a parody or a good idea that becomes laborious in the execution. It's lovingly corny, great fun, good-looking and respectful.
3056	3	a	Sausage Party is an equal opportunity offender, but if you can stomach that you'll find a movie with a lot of heart and big ideas to ponder.
3057	6	a	A romance as pleasantly bland as the city that is its setting -- Orlando.
3058	3	a	An engrossing family drama about old age, nursing homes, dementia, death and siblings trying to forge a new bond with each other.
3059	3	a	A really satisfying suspenser, but also really, really fun.
3060	0	a	Nowadays, it doesn't really scare me anymore, but I love watching it for the way it moves.
3061	6	a	It can't sell the idea that Gaspard Ulliel's Hannibal is ever going to mature into Hopkins' complex monster, and without that, it's just a slick exercise in futility.
3062	9	a	sheer dreariness directed with fists of ham
3063	6	a	Alas, there is no treasure, buried or otherwise, but only fool's gold in the silly script.
3064	4	a	Ms. Vardalos' has loaded her charmingly fluffy script with cute idiosyncrasies in place of actual characters.
3065	4	a	Panic Room made sense, and Flightplan does not. None at all, really.
3066	1	a	It's a high-spirited lark that works thanks to Russell's dazzling direction, delicious period details and a parade of stellar performances.
3067	6	a	"It's no ""Under the Tuscan Sun,"" but it's a far better sit than ""When in Rome."
3068	4	a	Make E.T. a bad dude whose momma never loved him and we're talking real scorched-earth policy here ... These guys are dividers, not uniters.
3069	9	a	The film's attitude toward female characters is so relentlessly cruel and dismissive, that it's impossible to pay attention to all the supposedly sweet stuff that surrounds Lions' hard-hearted center.
3070	9	a	Alas for James, sadness is not a jerk license and his bid to seem dark and complicated merely comes across as tiresome self-pity.
3071	8	a	Actually the last movie that I had liked so much that I bothered to go to cinema for the second time. Never again I was so blown away by cinematic quality to buy tickets for repeated viewing.
3072	4	a	Delves into the political, psychological, and social tension in the Cuban Missile Crisis and the power struggle between the Kennedys and the Joint Chiefs of Staff. 
3073	1	a	Like a favorite and enthralling CD soundtrack that takes you places magical.
3074	4	a	A lot more watchable than its awful trailer indicates.
3075	5	a	disjointed and disappointing
3076	4	a	"MacFarland just can't go toe-to-toe with the likes of Liam Neeson or Charlize Theron. Parts of ""West"" look like those old Oscar intros where Billy Crystal would be spliced into actual movies."
3077	3	a	A gloriously real story that feels as timeless as the great teen comedies of John Hughes, and as painful as My So-Called Life. It's the kind of movie that only comes around once every decade or so, but it's well worth the wait.
3078	9	a	Once again, you will believe that a talking CGI stuffed animal can be a racist, hateful monster with no redeeming qualities ... but his greatest sin is that he's not funny.
3079	0	a	Frances McDormand is phenomenal in this surefire awards contender from Martin McDonagh-it's a renegade masterpiece that will get you good. 
3080	5	a	There's no question that it sounds good in concept. But in execution it amounts to little more than putting lipstick on a very old pig.
3081	5	a	It's about theft, all right...of your money, your time, and the devices of a dozen other trite Hollywood star projects.
3082	6	a	For all its technical prowess, it can't shake the feeling that we've seen this all before... and that it was probably better the first time.
3083	3	a	It's not only a sports movie with the usual big games and important shots, but also a coach movie, with inspiring locker room speeches and difficult moral decisions.
3084	4	a	With Life or Something Like it, director Stephen Herek is the envoy for the unreliable emotional demonstrations of Hollywood. But this film maintains a modicum of actual inspiration, nonetheless.
3085	3	a	A funny-serious movie with gorgeous cars and colours and an amazing feel for the artefacts of an instantly vanished era.
3086	1	a	Bing and Bob off on another road, in the fourth -- and many say funniest -- of their famous 'Road' series. If nothing else, it may be their wildest.
3087	8	a	One could not have imagined that this franchise would sink so low as to introduce dreadlocked Preda-dogs, but this film has two of them.
3088	4	a	...an old-fashioned and flat-out fun monster movie that benefits from Treat Williams' tremendously engaging lead performance.
3089	4	a	Veber has created a film which manages to be both humorous and thought-provoking.
3090	4	a	If you don't mind the inert drama at the core, Bright Star at least gives you plenty of eye candy.
3091	1	a	Easily overcomes its familiar beats, thanks to a real attention to character detail, a nonjudgmental approach to all the flaws plaguing the players, and a cast that works beautifully together.
3092	4	a	Gets by on the elements of fun and frivolity common to all the Aardman animations.
3093	1	a	...a horror experience that's mature, dark, and disturbing to the bone. [Full review in Spanish]
3094	6	a	Derivative of several molds and unable to really take command of any of them.
3095	6	a	Forced and formulaic sequel ... is a tedious disappointment.
3096	6	a	It starts out with a tsunami -- and ends up standing in a puddle.
3097	3	a	Anybody familiar with London will appreciate Mazer's anti-Curtis approach to the city, more Soho than South Bank, but regardless of region it's hard to resist I Give It a Year's spiky charms.
3098	4	a	In Auteil's less dramatic but equally incisive performance, he's a charismatic charmer likely to seduce and conquer.
3099	6	a	The film's curdled aftertaste is so frustrating that it may be hard to remember why Must Love Dogs ever seemed so endearing and entertaining in the first place.
3100	4	a	By emphasizing the breakdown of a marriage without ever establishing the hope and dreams that gave birth to it, Mendes has made leaden and incessantly depressing what was insightful and breathlessly dramatic on the page.
3101	6	a	Blandly staged and simply told.
3102	1	a	A remarkable, deeply moving melding of fact and fiction.
3103	2	a	Girls Trip is better plotted than the similarly themed, Scarlett Johansson-vehicle Rough Night from earlier this year. It has a looseness to its structure that helps the momentum move from one crazy set-piece to the next.
3104	6	a	"What he has delivered is adequate, but it doesn't have any flavor - and of all the things Fincher is, ""bland"" is not usually one of them."
3105	7	a	Perhaps it accurately conveys the more mundane side of the war on terror, but that doesn't make for an entertaining film.
3106	3	a	If Schrader has had to deal with an onslaught of compromised projects over the past two decades, First Reformed is not only the purest distillation of his intentions in quite some time, but also one of his most acutely reserved.
3107	3	a	Rules of Engagement may be a feel good movie that lacks the imaginative thrusts of David O. Russell's The Three Kings, but for what it is this is one of the better examples.
3108	7	a	The heroes, though eye-poppingly rendered, remain emotionally as one-dimensional as any computer-game avatar.
3109	5	a	Not a greatly different recipe from that of the first picture, but the results aren't as tasty this time around...Jason should not have been re-Bourne.
3110	4	a	Charming and silly.
3111	3	a	Seinfeld's quick wit and glib personality are strong enough to give the scattershot story an illusion of coherence.
3112	5	a	...in TRAINSPOTTING the filmmakers are so far over the line, that I could not like the picture no matter how hard I tried.
3113	3	a	The combination of terrific footage with a low, rumbling score of doom makes this a compelling horror show.
3114	0	a	An apocalyptic sweat chamber nervously situated between complacency and heartbreaking could-have-been hopefulness.
3115	1	a	There are no zombies in the streets, boogeymen in the basement or witches in the woods -- and yet it is one of the most terrifying films in years.
3116	1	a	You'll never look at your neighborhood supermarket the same way again.
3117	3	a	While Seth Rogen's no Steve Carell, he's perfect for Knocked Up: Both the star and the movie are flabby, immature and almost always funny.
3118	3	a	How will this play in the non-Pynchon community? Not at all, sez us. But for the converted or the plain curious, it's something to see, if not cherish. 
3119	3	a	The overall effect is not so unlike Mameha's description of geisha themselves: a moving work of art.
3120	2	a	"Director Seth Gordon's best film since his brilliant debut, ""The King Of Kong: A Fistful Of Quarters."
3121	1	a	Three on a Couch is a film that flies any number of directions.
3122	6	a	Confusing and, at times, positively frustrating, John Carter is a film that screams too much post-production tinkering. During the screening, I actually turned to Film Fix co-host Jeff Marker and asked him if we had missed a reel.
3123	9	a	It's as remorseless and disheartening as any of the others, more gory and less scary.
3124	2	a	For every moment of grotesque violence there are several beautifully directed, well written and fearlessly acted moments that counter. Killer Joe is a trashy and at times shocking Texan tale to be sure, but one that's worth watching. 
3125	5	a	I'm not saying an R rating would have necessarily made Little Man a better movie, but at least it would have made it a more honest one.
3126	4	a	It's high anxiety. Too bad the landing is so bumpy.
3127	4	a	The problem with Vantage Point, or at least one problem, is that it depends too much on coincidence. The film relies on things breaking a certain way for nearly every plot advancement.
3128	3	a	I like that it's willing to engage in a controversial statement even if it doesn't have all the ammunition it needs to back up its stance.
3129	6	a	a tepid update of the screwball comedy formula with vaguely satiric overtones
3130	3	a	A naturalistic thriller that gives itself over to the tremendous, hushed force of the late Philip Seymour Hoffman.
3131	2	a	Worth seeing for the expert archival selections, but a decidedly mixed bag for anyone familiar, or unfamiliar, with the times.
3132	3	a	compellingly strange twist on the mafia genre
3133	10	a	If a worse studio film comes out this year, we're in deep trouble, people. This film is so bad it will hurt your brain. And even if you leave your brain at home, your spinal column will still object...[a] godawful, lame-brained mess of a movie. 
3134	4	a	You, Me and Dupree, a houseguest-from-hell tale, is an amiable comedy, but patched together from the plots of so many other movies, recent and otherwise, as to create a distracting sense of deja vu throughout.
3135	7	a	Try as it might to hold our attention, it disappoints at every turn, ending in a whimper rather than a bang.
3136	4	a	An ambitious, too ambitious, effort by Curtis Hall that shows talent and a future behind the camera.
3137	5	a	Doom has some good jolts and action sequences, and never takes itself too seriously. However, watching the squad roaming around the dark corridors and sewer system of the research station starts to get repetitive.
3138	1	a	If Gibson's use of blood and violence makes his audience squirm in their seats and allows the audience to question his film - then he's done his job as a filmmaker...
3139	3	a	wo Weeks Notice is very much a movie that rides on its co-stars, but it rides nicely.
3140	3	a	Essentially postmodern and deconstructivist, what could have been a mishmash of animation and live action, fantasy and realism, CG effects and handdrawn segments, under Lima's inspired helm becomes a unified entertainment suitable for kids and adults.
3141	4	a	This one coasts by on Hanks' immense appeal and charm, but more focus and a touch more sharpness are needed to make it really come alive.
3142	10	a	Godawful, pointless, preachy sequel.
3143	1	a	A dazzling exploration of the soul of a reverend overwhelmed by his guilt over the death of his son in Iraq.
3144	1	a	[A] stunning film, sometimes remarkably moving - at times sublimely beautiful, often sickeningly brutal, but never banal, nor specifically blameful.
3145	5	a	"For all of the fun that ""Ready Player One"" thinks it is having, if you look behind the curtain of its stratagems you'll find a ho-hum young adult sci-fi movie. "
3146	6	a	A painfully squishy centre completely undoes this rom-com, although it's difficult to know what might have made it less goofy. 
3147	3	a	Adams is somehow more cartoonish than the animated version of Giselle at the beginning of the film.
3148	2	a	There were many moments where I was going from nail-biting to knee-slapping.
3149	3	a	Smartly written, perfectly delivered dialogue, accompanied by a sunny, hopeful ending.
3150	6	a	If you have a soft spot for man's best friend, it's a pretty good throwaway movie.
3151	2	a	Slight, silly, sweet and, yes, quirky, Paper Heart doesn't really have a whole lot to say, but it says it in a unique and inventive way.
3152	0	a	"It's difficult to sift through the top of the Pixar movies and pick a ""favorite"", let alone a ""best"", but this is one that has a real claim to both. "
3153	2	a	The weight of Sofia Coppola's circuitous script is carried on the shoulders of the career-defining performances given by Bill Murray and Scarlett Johansson.
3154	3	a	[Amy Adams is] every Disney princess in one ebullient package.
3155	3	a	The best of the sequels. Explores the aftermath of Rocky's success.
3156	2	a	Menashe may be a film of understated storytelling and plot, but its pleasures lie primarily in the wonderfully observational approach that Weinstein takes to his protagonist.
3157	2	a	Tenma wisely powers the boy's heart with positive energy, something that spreads to the movie as well.
3158	1	a	That the film manages to be touching without being maudlin, and to be smart without being mean-spirited, is perhaps what really seals the deal.
3159	5	a	If you want to punish your kids, send them to bed without dinner. If you want to disturb, frighten and depress them while making sure they fail biology, take them to the animated feature Barnyard.
3160	3	a	That's part of the power conveyed by the sparse storytelling - it keeps bringing connections and realisations to the surface. Little is said, but much becomes apparent.
3161	10	a	The only people who deserve to see Jonah Hex are Hitler and the CEO of British Petroleum.
3162	6	a	Bitterly cynical, redundantly evoking regret and acceptance.
3163	3	a	The performances are sincere and Mr. Damon actually seems to be having a ball, giving one of the best and most mature performances of his career.
3164	7	a	"It's too bad few people will actually experience ""Long Halftime Walk"" in its native format. Stripped of gimmicks, and the movie is substantially dulled, exposing a feeble story at the heart of all the technical wizardry. "
3165	5	a	This romantic/comedy asks the question how much souvlaki can you take before indigestion sets in.
3166	1	a	After it's finished making you cry, The Light Between Oceans provides a rich story that demands discussion.
3167	1	a	Another film telling the story of Jesus? Yeah, but much more than that.
3168	4	a	For those about to rock, we salute you. A fond acknowledgement of a special time when a studio produced several albums that signaled key moments in music history.
3169	3	a	Stylish and sly, an engaging exercise that gives us less than meets the eye.
3170	0	a	A hopeful look at how humanity can be brought together by something as simple, and as complicated, as sports, 'Invictus' is one of the finest movies of the year.
3171	2	a	The Way Back is an epic adventure with enough humour to keep it from feeling dour but enough realism to make it really feel like everything is at stake.
3172	4	a	Implausible yet wholly unforgettable
3173	2	a	I think it's courageous -- it's something we're not used to seeing from this category of movies these days. A stark honesty is presented here.
3174	3	a	First Reformed begins to get really interesting when Schrader turns the tables on his hero-and us, and possibly himself.
3175	4	a	An airy, nostalgic celebration of roller disco.
3176	3	a	This cinematic dramatization is measured in tone, and Ed Helms is particularly good.
3177	6	a	With its kind of enjoyable, high volume techno-organ funeral music and its little bits of humor, I've got to admit it. It could have been worse.
3178	3	a	It's certainly smarter than the last few Bonds that have zipped in and out of the viewer's mind. The impact of this espionage adventure lasts after it has ended.
3179	5	a	Man of the Year has some nice ideas and a handful of excellent scenes, but it struggles to find the right tone and is hamstrung by a ridiculous plot point.
3180	3	a	Not only is Invictus a well-acted, well-directed story of a remarkable man, but it also illustrates how sports can be a salve to a wounded community.
3181	3	a	"The operative word on this one isn't really ""seventeen"" but ""edge."
3182	2	a	Whether you consider it a smart thriller or a paint-by-numbers spy caper, The Bourne Identity is a dynamic interpretation of Robert Ludlum's bestselling novel.
3183	7	a	A clumsily executed, forgettable mess that's too dark for kids, too dull for teens and too dumb for adults
3184	4	a	The birds are cute, but an unambitious storytelling sans twists and turns, makes this bird-watching unexciting if not tedious. The screenplay lacks depth and so does the conflict between characters.
3185	4	a	Meticulous Civil War story runs a little long.
3186	7	a	...suspension of disbelief is strained to its limits by portentous dialogue which, in overuse, dilutes its potency.
3187	2	a	It's extremely difficult to portray a legendary historical figure in a way that does justice to both that figure's momentousness and his humanity, but Oyelowo has found a way to do it.
3188	2	a	It's too long, and the ending is curious, but the overall combo of serious themes and ridiculous situations is a joy to witness.
3189	2	a	While Snakes on a Plane isn't nearly as tight and twisted as it could have been, it'll no doubt tickle its intended audience endlessly.
3190	2	a	She creates an affecting counterpoint to the hyper-charged insanity back at the Wonderland condo.
3191	5	a	In the end, Felt's real story is more exciting - or at least potentially so - than the version that plays out on the screen.
3192	2	a	I love this stuff; it's remarkably silly, yet the actors play it so straight you'd think it was Hamlet.
3193	3	a	An original breath of fresh air. It's an unexpected delight.
3194	0	a	Bottom line, The Incredibles has some great funny moments, but it also tells a decent story - and that's the catch when making any kind of movie.
3195	3	a	Enchanting.
3196	7	a	There are virtually no surprises in the suspense thriller Cold Creek Manor, except that such a predictable script would attract such a solid cast and a director, Mike Figgis, who isn't known for his mainstream tastes.
3197	0	a	Look at it from an entertainment standpoint. What you'll find is that it's a very entertaining, sometimes very funny and always extremely playful film.
3198	4	a	Barrels along at the start before becoming mired in sentimentality.
3199	5	a	May satisfy die hard Bond fans, but won't work for anyone else. Among the franchise's weakest efforts.
3200	1	a	American Psycho is not a picture you'd want to miss.
3201	2	a	Bee Movie will make you think twice before swatting one of the yellow and black guys next time you're being buzzed.
3202	6	a	Crossover could've used a little more sports action in place of some overwrought melodrama.
3203	3	a	I haven't laughed harder at anything this year, but I would have a hard time recommending this gender-bending gut-buster to anyone who doesn't have a high threshold for crude sexual humor and stereotypes.
3204	4	a	The more we get to know about Hancock and how he acquired his name and mysterious powers, the less entertaining it becomes.
3205	9	a	Middle-school antihero Greg Heffley may depict himself as a comic illustration in Jeff Kinney's bestselling kids' books, but director Thor Freudenthal turns him into an outright caricature.
3206	8	a	Little Man is easily the creepiest movie I've seen in my life.
3207	0	a	I am not exaggerating when I say this is one of the best flicks to come out in years. It is perfect in every aspect of filmmaking, i.e. acting, directing, pacing, editing, make-up, set design, special effects.
3208	5	a	It might have fared better as a TV mini-series, where novelistic plot strands can be unpacked at length. McGregor is simply wrong for his role: He's too young, too modern, too smart.
3209	5	a	Oddly paced and emotionally flat.
3210	6	a	The film is dark and bleak with little real sense of wonder--the thing that should be Spielberg's forte.
3211	5	a	What should have been a challenging, inspirational, laugh-out-loud romantic comedy about a mother trying to make the best of the see-saw challenge between work and home isn't very good at all.
3212	3	a	Completely fun. Dujardin defies time periods. Bejo is all sparkly effervescence.
3213	2	a	It's all pretty predictable yet despite the occasional lapses into cuteness, it has a lot more going for it than the standard teen movie.
3214	3	a	A suspenseful thriller that showcases stunning visuals, great acting and a story that will keep you entertained from start to finish.
3215	4	a	[McDormand] makes both the character and her Laurel Canyon sanctuary feel genuinely lived.
3216	0	a	Exceptional, mature film dazzles, offers haunting insights.
3217	3	a	So earnest that it borders on hagiography, Clint Eastwood's Invictus remains a powerful slice of history that will leave you amazed at the decency of which we are capable.
3218	3	a	Thanks to Sharif's performance, this French-language import is made quite watchable.
3219	4	a	Noted killjoy Sam Mendes might seem like a counterintuitive addition to the series, but it turns out he's aces with action staging and set-pieces soaked in local flavor.
3220	1	a	After watching it, I wasn't too sure myself if my choices would be any different than those M makes. He has no clue as to the life he's led, only feelings that tell him he wasn't the type of man he necessarily wanted to be.
3221	9	a	Don't expect much brainpower in The Skulls.
3222	4	a	Over-ambitious but still utterly beautiful
3223	6	a	As a nightmarish vision of hell on earth, Silent Hill is a triumph of production and art design. As a coherent story, it's little more than a string of video game scenarios.
3224	4	a	In summer multiplex fare, Owen Wilson does better than Cable Guy, but not much.
3225	9	a	Crossover expects moviegoers to ignore the inept script and acting and root for its characters anyway.
3226	4	a	"Hitchcock"" is fun to watch, but unlike ""Psycho,"" it scarcely draws blood. "
3227	0	a	This very well might be the best film ever made.
3228	4	a	Like Billy, this portrait is flawed yet noble and sensitive.
3229	3	a	Those looking for a more in-depth, probing account of Mandela's complicated life might wish to look elsewhere. Invictus is an absorbing, jubilant tale about the healing power of sport.
3230	3	a	It's hard for find fault with any film that addresses a changing teenage world with such compassion and decency. An unexpected delight in more ways than one.
3231	4	a	Wolf tale is all about romance, innuendo-filled jokes.
3232	3	a	Smith's filthy dialogue is guaranteed to offend, while inspiring surreptitious giggles.
3233	2	a	Nolan delivers a movie in which the complexity of plot sometimes exceeds the complexity of the ideas. Still, he manages to create some captivating cinematic magic along the way.
3234	5	a	It's a cynical attempt to plunder your wallet with broad buffoonery you can see for free on TV.
3235	3	a	The third, most technically accomplished panel in a youth trilogy that began with Elephant and continued with Last Days, finds Van Sant, American cinema's most dedicated chronicler of disaffected youths, in top form.
3236	3	a	An inventive, black comedy.
3237	9	a	Andy Tennant may be the best marketing guru in Hollywood. It's too bad he's directing Hitch
3238	1	a	A sex comedy with a large heart and a generous spirit, Judd Apatow's Knocked Up is a thrilling piece of work - a character-driven story rooted in adult reality that's the funniest film since, uh, what? Maybe ... ever.
3239	7	a	Because Black Snake Moan asks its characters to confront demons involving sin and sex, it stomps into an area that lives between exploitative movie trash and Southern Gothic literature. It's bold without being especially believable.
3240	3	a	Thanks to a dynamic, emotionally astute script from Berger and Aptaker, that coupled with Berlanti's unobtrusive direction helps make this movie an agreeable revelation I likely couldn't have resisted even if I had wanted to.
3241	1	a	The heist is fun, but the detailed inside look at the workings of a speedway really makes Logan Lucky special.
3242	3	a	Fans, of course, will devour this film, but there's plenty to chew on for the uninitiated as well.
3243	7	a	A lackluster teenage true-crime tale.
3244	5	a	Directed by Rob Bowman in a palette of dark, muddy colors, Reign of Fire is often incomprehensible and hardly ever entertaining -- even unintentionally.
3245	3	a	It's like being on a conveyor belt headed to a darkened doom.
3246	3	a	So skillfully delivered is this sturm und drang... that the film's shortcomings are all but buried beneath the sheer awesome spectacle.
3247	3	a	[The film] may lose the kids after the melancholy first half, but wraps things up with a wonderfully satisfying tale filled with warmth and friendship.
3248	1	a	The film's taut, insightful arc is a reminder of the lost power of restraint.
3249	1	a	Haynes directs with a subtle precision, the script by Phyllis Nagy is a well-crafted gem, and Cate Blanchett and Rooney Mara make for one of the most intriguing and memorable movie couples of the year.
3250	4	a	Del Toro's artistry is definitely something to celebrate, but there's one thing about Crimson Peak that's unforgivable - it's just not scary.
3251	1	a	"Live Flesh"" is brimming with the acclaimed Spanish director's high-heeled flourishes."
3252	9	a	Obviously, it's rubbish.
3253	4	a	About halfway through the movie, it changes direction, becoming less a biographical drama about Petey than a maudlin buddy movie about his relationship with Dewey.
3254	3	a	...Hoffman and Linney ably step into their complex, sporadically unlikable characters.
3255	2	a	Even though we could reasonably wonder if there had to be yet another one of these blasted suburban satires, at least Revolutionary Road is a pretty good entry in the field.
3256	5	a	It's like we returned to Disneyland to find it looking as magical as ever, but with most of the rides closed. 
3257	4	a	Whatever its virtues, this is entirely too much melodrama to cram into a feature film. Characters are lost, too much happens off camera, and the whole compacted thing feels like Reader's Digest history.
3258	1	a	Powerful and upsetting.
3259	4	a	Uneven, and likely only to satisfy the Faithful. Others will find it sporadically amusing, but not worth the full price of admission.
3260	2	a	The Predator still isn't able to quite recapture whatever magic in a bottle the original film created, but it is able to make for an entertaining enough sequel.
3261	3	a	This very well-acted, often amusing and dirty-minded hard-R film still stands out in a sea of market-driven blandness.
3262	5	a	For all the goodwill that a new Clint Eastwood picture carries, there's no getting around the fact that this one just doesn't work.
3263	6	a	Cranston and his dye-job are a dozen years too old for this part, and they cast the whole movie accordingly. 
3264	8	a	I'd rather have my head stuck in a vise than be forced to sit through another viewing.
3265	4	a	Genuinely warm-spirited, with three lovable central performances from Gadon, Powley and Reynor.
3266	0	a	The happy ending had me on my feet cheering throughout the final credits. I can't wait to see it again.
3267	1	a	An arresting, emotionally-charged paean to the insulating power of imagination.
3268	5	a	Despite all the accepted props, from the lonely Southern plantation set in a miasmic bog to the squeaking bats and creaking coffins, this thriller is a pretty pallid offering.
3269	4	a	If you can turn off your Vulcan circuits and ignore illogical loopholes, Disclosure generally delivers the goods.
3270	6	a	The movie's overall cast of gloom - no one here has cracked a smile in years - contributes to a leaden aura.
3271	3	a	Has action, heart, but superhero is an alcoholic.
3272	4	a	[Dustin Hoffman and Barbra Streisand] seem to have been waiting their whole careers to do unrestrained comedy, and they step into their roles with unparalleled enthusiasm.
3273	3	a	Pattinson ditches the fangs but keeps the brooding, in a thoughtful essay on a man fighting for meaning within hollow surrounds. Riveting, poetic and thoroughly Cronenberg.
3274	5	a	Imagine a parallel universe where Harry Potter got pumped up on steroids and you'll have an idea of what to expect from The Last Witch Hunter.
3275	3	a	It's hard to imagine a scenario where James White can't be pointed to as among the best of this year's American debuts. 
3276	1	a	One of the best movies to hit Sundance this year, with an awards-worthy performance by Cynthia Nixon.
3277	3	a	A well-paced, colourfully shot, and keenly edited sequel to challenge the original.
3278	6	a	Set during the Grenada War, Clint Eastwood's war movie is a formulaic, old-fashioned actioner wearing its ideology on its sleeves.
3279	5	a	Like a big box of Valentine's chocolates that turn out to be a mite stale when you bite into them.
3280	0	a	"Rocky II"" represents far more than just a good-looking fight. It's all about trusting in yourself and overcoming fear in striving for greatness."
3281	6	a	While many have praised Pike's portrayal of the famed journalist, this will be a dissent. Sometimes, showy and intense are confused with great. 
3282	6	a	Click to read review
3283	6	a	You simply don't get a sense that Lanie's learned anything, other than that being too ambitious is a really bad thing.
3284	3	a	Does little to alter the formula of the original, but the two films set a nice example of successful use of the concept of theme and variation.
3285	6	a	An apprehensive cross between an elegiac tone poem of loss, an ever-twisting murder mystery, and a character study revolving around the regret of lost innocence, Mystic River tries to be all of these things and ends up falling short on all counts.
3286	3	a	Writes a new chapter in the heist genre while showcasing great new talent.
3287	9	a	It looks like a lame made-for-TV movie, features a no-name cast and revolves around a hackneyed idea.
3288	3	a	Call Me By Your Name is a film made with great care. [Full Review in Spanish] 
3289	0	a	An emotionally literate film about a grieving family trying to jump-start their lives again by running a small zoo for animals.
3290	5	a	An uneasy mix of post-modern, self-referential archness and spaghetti Western bravado that's not likely to please anybody.
3291	9	a	Falls entirely short of its potential
3292	3	a	Perceptive, funny, unusually edgy voyage into the comic travails of schoolyard politics and childhood friendship.
3293	1	a	Serenity should not be missed. If you plan on missing it you best get a foot ready, 'cuz you're going to be kicking yourself when you find out what you've been missing.
3294	2	a	A prettily shot piece about the contracts that bind people in a community.
3295	4	a	What pushes the film over the top is the terrific turn by Adams, who really seems like a Disney heroine come to life.
3296	5	a	Hereafter doesn't feel like a Clint Eastwood film; it's more like a very special edition of John Edward's psychic TV show.
3297	4	a	As a film, The Miracle Season is more mundane than miracle, but it will probably make you smile, and there's nothing wrong with that.
3298	6	a	Despite its considerable unwholesome appeal, the movie gives us the feeling it has been chained up as well and that chain won't let it go any farther than a single outrageous idea.
3299	9	a	You're more likely to laugh Gary Fleder's woebegone excuse for a thriller off the screen than to find it remotely suspenseful, exciting, or --most of all--plausible.
3300	9	a	Dark, moody, extremely twisted and hard to enjoy on any level.
3301	4	a	Beautifully-realized visuals nearly make up for the well-worn story in this Disney adaptation of the Edgar Rice Burroughs character.
3302	3	a	Nicolas Cage goes off the deep end even more than usual in the crazily entertaining, Werner Herzog-helmed Bad Lieutenant: Port Of Call New Orleans.
3303	3	a	Enjoyable, smartly directed comedy thriller with a clever script and engaging performances from its ensemble cast.
3304	4	a	An odd fish, this, although there's no denying the conviction the ruby-lipped temptress Liv Tyler brings to washing a car.
3305	8	a	Because he's an Oscar winner with a rep now for headlining turkeys, watching Cuba Gooding Jr. in trash like Daddy Day Camp almost hurts.
3306	4	a	Portrait of leader with crowd in the background. Martin L. King's speeches are again relevant. [Full Review in Spanish]
3307	5	a	The Jurassic movies have by now palpably entered the plane of baldly profit-hunting, unpretentious entertainment...
3308	9	a	There are enough laughs scattered throughout A Million Ways to Die in the West that while you're watching it, the movie seems like a passable comedy. By the time you get home, though, you can barely remember the jokes. 
3309	3	a	The leads' chemistry is almost, well, spooky, Dan Aykroyd's nerdy enthusiasm rubbing deliciously against a persona-perfecting turn from Bill Murray - and there's even the odd surprise.
3310	4	a	Not one of Eastwood's best, but at times the story is quite moving. And, you can't help but cherish the performance by Morgan Freeman as Nelson Mandela. Nicely done, Morgan. Paul Chambers, CNN.
3311	4	a	Like Atlantis, it's one of those Disney adventure cartoons that takes too long getting to anything really exciting -- and once there becomes too frenetic to effectively wow.
3312	2	a	To me, this is a messy, overplotted, disappointing movie, mostly rescued by a cast of very talented actors.
3313	4	a	Crowe, to his credit, is more concerned with insights about family than romance - and some of these are heart-on-sleeve touching if you've got a sweet tooth for the stickier stuff.
3314	1	a	War of the Worlds is easily the most bone-chillingly scary movie Spielberg has made, but it also taps into an unsettling kind of fear that never goes for the cheap thrill. The dread Spielberg conjures is horribly personal.
3315	5	a	A romantic comedy so vague and sadly undernourished that it makes one of Nora Ephron's low-cal strawberry sodas seem as tempting as a Philip Barry feast.
3316	3	a	What results is equally tragic and beautiful, highlighting the terrible consequences of societal rejection and stigma.
3317	5	a	When the twists and turns are finally settled and the corn is harvested, moviegoers may feel more disappointed than thrilled.
3318	4	a	Fast and fairly engaging ... but in the end it feels a bit pointless.
3319	6	a	Lightweight entertainment for kids with a thankfully low level of obnoxiousness.
3320	1	a	...giving a much-needed shot in the arm to a genre that's become so pompous and full of itself that it wasn't any fun anymore.
3321	6	a	Wright knows how to keep the energy spinning, but he also doesn't know when to stop.
3322	1	a	Eastwood makes moving pictures that seldom collapse under the burden of sentiment. He has a muscular understanding of how kernels of wisdom needn't become caramel corn.
3323	3	a	"Menashe"" is a slice of an America that you've rarely seen before on screen, a world that largely remains from the mainstream, but to which Weinstein shows us a bird's eye view of here. "
3324	7	a	This film was born without an ending. Instead, it just sort of stops going, in an extremely disappointing and dull fashion.
3325	6	a	The movie provides more questions than answers.
3326	7	a	You'd be hard-pressed to come up with a movie that ticks more of the boxes for a perfect storm of So Bad It's Perfect.
3327	3	a	For me, the movie's best moments revel in the actor's rabid wit and acerbic facial acrobatics, none more so insanely funny and devastating as his battle of wills with an obnoxious commercial director.
3328	3	a	"It Comes at Night is a total success, building dread gradually and avoiding an overreliance on the kind of jump scares lesser films mine to absurdity. It makes ""It Comes at Night"" less fun, but more resonant."
3329	8	a	A comedy without any identifiable humor. Retreat is dreadful, but to consider just how many gifted performers are here treading water makes the heart sick. Ralphie, how dare you.
3330	0	a	Jamie Foxx does a magnificent job in his most challenging outing since Ray.
3331	5	a	One of those well-intentioned misfires that so frustrate both audiences and critics -- brimming with thematic potential, yet consistently unable to establish and maintain an effective tone.
3332	0	a	great fun
3333	6	a	It's unapologetic hackwork aimed at guys who never forgave Mom for throwing out their Hot Wheels set.
3334	3	a	An intelligent and sophisticated biopic with a tour-de-force performance from Pike.
3335	4	a	ascerbic but missing something
3336	4	a	The film's title is defined as the big finish to a magic trick, but the prestige of The Prestige just lies there like an abracadaver.
3337	6	a	"The Dressmaker"" is only sew-sew."
3338	3	a	It reunites again Titanic doomed shipmates Leonardo DiCaprio, Kate Winslet and Kathy Bates, but this time as doomed suburbanites.
3339	5	a	Instead of gently skewering the conventions of contemporary animation, it simply follows them to a T
3340	4	a	Skyfall may not be another Casino Royale, but it ranks higher than almost anything else the franchise has had to offer for over a decade. 
3341	2	a	Becoming Jane may fudge the facts, but it finds the more compelling emotional truth.
3342	4	a	This movie is more like a B-grade comic book adaptation than the A-list production it should have been.
3343	3	a	There's no small pleasure in seeing a well-worn tale told with class and style.
3344	5	a	Don't bother... 
3345	2	a	A solid-but-imperfect thriller.
3346	3	a	Eliminate the dialogue, and this would still be a captivating film.
3347	4	a	It's entertaining while it lasts but dissipates from memory the moment it's over.
3348	8	a	What's the point of making a parody that's dumber than the stuff it parodies?
3349	5	a	If there was an Oscar for the Silliest Movie Category, then The Skulls might be in with a good chance of winning.
3350	9	a	I wouldn't call it normal laziness, but I would call it an over-ambitious laziness.
3351	1	a	Miami Vice isn't perfect, but it is perfectly mesmerizing.
3352	3	a	As intelligent as it is disturbing, sustained by a brilliant cast. [Full Review in Spanish]
3353	6	a	Ho-hum, except that it's all set up for a sequel, and I wouldn't bet against it. Vin Diesel is a hard man to kill.
3354	6	a	There are no real surprises and the twists that Altman throws us seem cooked up at the last minute and wind up uninteresting.
3355	3	a	With Logan Lucky, Soderbergh, one of our most inventive and unpredictable directors, just wants to have fun and bring the audience in on it. That's going to be all right with a lot of us.
3356	2	a	Whiskey Tango Foxtrot is powered by a more restrained Tina Fey, who ditches overly gag-filled comedy for one of her finest performances yet.
3357	2	a	It is one dark and downbeat mofo of a movie.
3358	4	a	The cars are a rockin' and even the friggin' movie screen felt like it was shaking as the cars flew by.
3359	0	a	No film aficionado should miss 'Nebraska.'
3360	3	a	It's so unique in its style, delivery, and execution that it's undoubtedly the most fascinating film to come along so far this year.
3361	1	a	What Haynes gets so perfectly right with this film really is the very specific sense of time and place.
3362	8	a	For movies like Vantage Point, life is too short.
3363	0	a	One of those rare films where you remember the names of the characters because you remember them -- as people, as types, as benchmarks.
3364	3	a	It's an in-your-face and exhausting portrayal of life gone bad, played out by a cast of actors all on the top of their game.
3365	3	a	Lee distills the flavor of this transforming event and hints at how it transformed some who were there. His movie is a contact high.
3366	4	a	never takes full advantage of its subject's scrappiness, too often falling back on training montages, against-all-odds rhetoric, and other movie rules that fail to surprise or invigorate.
3367	9	a	Calls to mind two of the worst westerns of the past thirty years...The problem isn't that the movie is moody and morose; it's that it's flat and tedious.
3368	4	a	National Security stays clear of those touchy poignant moments that have ruined so many buddy flicks.
3369	4	a	Performances are fiery and committed, successfully communicating the brain-bending decoding mission and its many areas of paranoia, deception, and dark confession. 
3370	0	a	I was utterly mesmerised, captivated and transported.
3371	6	a	Notwithsdanding the blood, gore, and CG effects, this is an old-fashioned historical saga, a throwabck to the sand-and-sandals epics of Quo Vadis and Ben-Hur.
3372	9	a	For it to have any appeal for persons who do not share the movie's beliefs would indeed be miraculous -- it's appallingly bad as anything other than a sermon.
3373	0	a	A true classic. Lancaster at top form, Curtis is great as his toady. A cynical masterpiece.
3374	3	a	Amid all this dazzling artifice, the film's most authentic source of power comes from its star.
3375	2	a	Writer/director Rodrigo Garcia is the son of famed Colombian novelist Gabriel Garcia Marquez, so maybe the filmmaker comes by all the magic and coincidence in his stories naturally.
3376	3	a	Land of the Dead works, and at times it works amazingly well -- but it's no classic, and I seriously doubt it will ever be considered as such.
3377	4	a	The film presents some fairly adult themes in an understandable way, and it's also less cheesy and sentimental than a lot of animated fare. But it still packs in some exciting action sequences and impressive comic relief.
3378	3	a	Gorgeous photography, schmaltzy story
3379	2	a	...because of all the mindless action, it's OK as an entertainment even though it's much darker and devoid of the bon mots that highlighted most Bond films.
3380	2	a	Lee and screenwriter Jean-Christophe Castelli are faithful to Fountain's novel.
3381	1	a	"Mildred is easily the most robust character McDormand has been given since ""Fargo,"" and she delivers both the maternal ferocity and the undimmed grief that the role and this intensely satisfying movie require."
3382	5	a	From Hollywood's school of pop psychology comes Don't Say a Word, a Freud for Dummy's journey into mind-cracking.
3383	2	a	An engaging action thriller painted against some of Europe's most beautiful locales.
3384	3	a	Oscars will not be forthcoming, but the Wayanses have hit on a formula -- gross-out humor, goofy sight gags, a flashy concept -- that works.
3385	0	a	Jay and Silent Bob, aside from being a sterling valentine to fans, serves as a wickedly perceptive satire of the movie business and the audience at large.
3386	5	a	[W]hy do the male cows have udders?.. This isn't supposed to be the animated version of TransAmerica. 
3387	2	a	Hurt is the virtuoso, rising above the Lawrence Kasdan histrionics and some loose acting.
3388	5	a	his is by no means a terrible film, but from a filmmaker as exceptional as Ang Lee it's a rare disappointment.
3389	3	a	Another over the top classic from Paul Verhoeven.
3390	9	a	Makes you long for the parentless state of the Martians the movie depicts, who kidnap a mother and inadvertently whisk up her little son during a mom-harvesting trip to Earth.
3391	3	a	Affecting adult drama has mature themes, content.
3392	0	a	"First Reformed"" is a miracle in its own regard, the rare type of film that leaves us with questions left to answer and for many, a desire to dig into it deeper through a second viewing."
3393	4	a	Invictus succeeds in making one sympathize with and root for Mandela; it does not succeed as a thrilling film-going experience, as it well could have.
3394	3	a	Worth the investment for veteran Costner's vintage performance and for the way in which the timely script dares to tackle some tough social questions in refreshingly-realistic, if perhaps politically-incorrect fashion.
3395	0	a	This film is so good it is devastating. A lot of people believe their parents didn't understand them. What if they didn't understand themselves?
3396	4	a	These outlandish extremes of tone do, unquestionably, mean that the film is a bizarre experience. But it is not, overall, an unsatisfying one.
3397	3	a	An intelligent and expertly-judged microcosm of the inanity of war.
3398	6	a	Wow, the only way this film could be more ludicrous is if they actually cast Ludacris in it. Oh wait...
3399	0	a	Giordana's redemptive vision provides a sense of discovery and a well of hope in the most devastating of troubles, and beautiful surprises in love, friendship and family.
3400	10	a	"Nothing makes a lot of sense in ""The House With a Clock in Its Walls,"" except perhaps when Black's character warns: ""This is no place for a kid."
3401	4	a	"It's hard to clinically define this as a ""good"" movie, but its merits as a fine and enjoyable one are certainly arguable."
3402	4	a	Though not exactly a gripping experience for adults, parents have reason to be grateful for a movie that has been so carefully tailored to preschool to first-grade sensibilities.
3403	3	a	Texas fable has heart and humor as uncles Michael Caine and Robert Duvall give Haley Joel Osment much-needed guidance.
3404	3	a	Who knew mathematics and numerology could be so engrossing?
3405	3	a	Dreamy and impressionistic, full of debauchery, drugs, disco, and dazzling couture, Saint Laurent is a biopic that picks its moments, leaving backstory behind.
3406	5	a	It shoots. And it shoots and shoots and shoots, but it never scores.
3407	5	a	So bad it's almost good.
3408	6	a	While directors Shari Springer Berman and Robert Pulcini are busy tipping their caps to their favorite literary figures, they seem to forget their obligation to good movie-making.

3415	0	a	The most well-loved of all Christmas movies.
3416	1	a	Somewhere between tension and release lies the heart of laughter, and Neil LaBute knows just where that spot is.
3417	6	a	Doesn't work very well because it thinks it's smarter than it is.
3418	2	a	It all hangs from a pitch-perfect performance by McGregor, who does as much to breathe life into his old friends as anyone. He believes that the silly old bear is right there, and so will you.

3423	5	a	Too strange for its own good, Careful is less interesting as a film than it is as a Canadian cinematic anomaly.
3424	6	a	Almost any moviegoer should be able to find something to enjoy, but it's hard to imagine anyone liking this mishmash from beginning to end.
3425	4	a	The film starts unraveling fast as fable and reality collide in messy ways. But for a brief moment the kings have their day in the sun.
3426	0	a	With their best film to date, the Pixar team has taken the animated feature into realms of narrative and visual design never before seen.
3427	9	a	It marks Eastwood's worst film I've seen at the cinemas and will hopefully be buried before his next project arrives.
3428	4	a	Powerful, painful for mature audiences only.
3429	4	a	Ewan McGregor has been judged unworthy of adapting Philip Roth in the US. But his directorial debut is finely crafted, and powered by visceral emotion embodied in one of his best performances.
3430	4	a	Singer keeps the conspiracy racing to its fated conclusion.
3431	3	a	One of the most trenchant, bitter and horrific looks at the 'atomic' and Cold War era.
3432	2	a	Under the direction of Jake Kasdan, Orange County crackles with sweeping camera movements and a zippy storytelling pace.
3433	5	a	It's a self-conscious attempt at a Hollywood caper with the mix of comedy, romance and conspiracy watered down to the point where you can see straight through it.
3434	5	a	...one of those supposedly daring erotic dramas that could actually work as a video touting abstinence. The sex is that soulless, that dingy, that diseased.
3435	1	a	Bright Star satisfies a hunger we may not have known we had, a hunger for an exquisitely done, emotional love story that marries heartbreaking passion to formidable filmmaking restraint...
3436	3	a	Dylan Thomas's life is represented here, but John Maybury's hollow romantic drama is more interested in his women than in his literary art.
3437	4	a	What works best are the moments of space horror. [Full Review in Spanish] 
3438	2	a	Absurdity reminiscent of Camus is married to a modernist cynicism that is most disquieting
3439	4	a	MacFarlane is one of the few male comic creative talents to have honed a style that stands against the Judd Apatow school of realism, but the movie just doesn't quite work.
3440	4	a	Flightplan is not a smart movie, but it can be a reasonably fun and entertaining one.
3441	0	a	A movie of impeccable surfaces and subterranean anxieties...
3442	3	a	Next Friday has everything you loved about last Friday.
3443	4	a	Plays out like a slow-motion sex farce.
3444	5	a	I lost interest somewhere in the middle of this film.
3445	3	a	It's a twisty, kinetic and satisfying thriller with a didn't-see-that-coming climax.
3446	4	a	"Eastwood's direction seems unsure and tentative, and the inclusion of a pop song -- the overbearing ""Colorblind"" -- is an obvious attempt to sell a few soundtrack discs."
3447	1	a	With a dazzling performance, Catherine Zeta-Jones dominates the picture with absolute assurance and a bewitching smile.
3448	9	a	Crammed with moppet mayhem, mawkish sentiment and bruising slapstick, it's a flat-footed retread only Right to Lifers could love.
3449	6	a	It would have, however, been nice if Generations would have gone beyond the scope of the television series to deliver something a bit more substantial.
3450	5	a	It runs out of steam at about the midway point and falls victim to clumsy, overcooked plotting. It's fun for a while, until it becomes more trick than treat.
3451	0	a	For all the dark and tragic moments that occur consistently throughout Three Billboards, Martin McDonagh never loses the light of optimism. His characters grow and learn on this odd journey of violence and grief.
3452	3	a	It's not perfect, but it's not like any other movie in theaters now.
3453	4	a	A delightful surprise that'll raise as many questions as it does bust guts.A very funny, blatantly satirical and insolently honest look into the life of the former it boy 
3454	4	a	Mary is depicted as a woman in open rebellion with tradition, beseeched on all sides by the treachery of jealous, sexist counsel. 
3455	6	a	...the film really only works in fits and starts...
3456	5	a	You will either find The Dressmaker a hoot or a perplexing bore, like a shaggy dog story that is not nearly as entertaining as the teller seems to think.
3457	4	a	Looking like a cross between Dublin-born Wilfrid Brambell's Steptoe, Robin Williams and Jamie Bell, it's an extraordinary performance, requiring little dialogue for us to see the pain deep in his/her soul.
3458	2	a	shockingly believable
3459	2	a	A decent formula motor racing film.
3460	5	a	Normally dependable comic actors are wasted in roles.
3461	3	a	A straightforward drama, this film works well enough for what it is but it could've been much better.
3462	5	a	Curiously smug and overly self-aware, [it's] exceedingly busy, but lacking in the heart and humor that were hallmarks of its predecessor.
3463	1	a	A very thoughtful and bewildering drama about a man who was meant to do great things in a world that was not ready to accept his eccentricities.
3464	4	a	Valkyrie isn't a great war movie, but within its own limited ambitions, it is enjoyable and never dull.
3465	3	a	Kagemusha, much like the similarly overblown but handsomely mounted Lawrence of Arabia, is an epic with a cipher in its point position.
3466	9	a	Obsessed with how clever it thinks it is that it completely sinks the romantic comedy pirate ship it sets forth to be
3467	5	a	a shallow, convoluted love story with some cheap laughs wrapped around an infomercial
3468	0	a	Pegg gives arguably his best performance in the three films, and his chemistry with Frost is unbeatable.
3469	5	a	Wobbly, uneven and dodgy, the best thing about this film is Zac Efron . And that's a sentence I never thought I'd write.
3470	3	a	Add director Werner Herzog to the mix, a guy who knows a thing or a hundred about obsessive protagonists, and we're in for quite the ride -- wild and weird and blackly comic.
3471	3	a	The movie depends for its success on the likability of Jamie Foxx, Morris Chestnut and Gabrielle Union, and because they're funny and pleasant, we enjoy the ride even though the destination is preordained.
3472	4	a	...Spacey delivers one of his most memorable performances...
3473	6	a	The heart of On Broadway is in the right place. But when the story behind a film is more interesting than what's on the screen, that's a problem.
3474	9	a	A major disappointment from first-class director Philip Kaufman.
3475	1	a	What more could you ask for in a sequel?
3476	1	a	The Savages is the perfect comic offering for a season when family Pandora's boxes come swinging open like so many must-return gifts.
3477	0	a	Despite a glacial exterior, this fine film holds us in its relentless grip.
3478	4	a	For the time being, the Harry Potter thrill ride is whizzing along very satisfactorily indeed.
3479	5	a	Vantage Point might sound intriguing on paper but it's all gimmick and not a lot of substance.
3480	5	a	Astro Boy is no awards contender.
3481	7	a	Vivid characters rendered impotent by a disorienting tone and a jerky, start-and-stop narrative that dilutes the film's putative emotional punch.
3482	3	a	A film of artistic ambition and devotion.
3483	3	a	The best thing about the movie is Kilmer's charming, manipulative and utterly despicable interpretation of the legendarily endowed John Holmes.
3484	6	a	Though not quite as anxious or callous as Stigmata, The Ring has been similarly put together with attention deficit disorder.
3485	0	a	The most searing film I've seen this year.
3486	2	a	Wryly funny.
3487	3	a	... a gripping piece of combat theater.
3488	6	a	David Duchovny and Demi Moore are well accessorized as display-model husband and wife. But this cautionary tale might be easier to swallow if all that stuff didn't look like it came from a Sky Mall catalog.
3489	9	a	Visually, it adores the women it introduces. Emotionally and intellectually, it mocks them.
3490	7	a	For better or worse this is no longer J.R.R. Tolkien's Hobbit it has become Peter Jackson's Hobbit. Lots of talking, walking and singing. Hard to take the villains seriously when they all sound like high-pitched singing versions of Elmer Fudd. 
3491	6	a	It's like an Artemus Gordon contrivance that won't quite work.
3492	5	a	The script, by Richard Jefferies, brings absolutely nothing new to the thriller table.
3493	5	a	A rattling collection of warmed-over ideas filmed on a paltry budget...doesn't do anything that Dracula and Prince of Darkness didn't already do better.
3494	4	a	Turteltaub wisely plays his strength by giving us extended close-ups of Bullock, who is at once canny and vulnerable, rising above this workmanlike comedy.
3495	4	a	I didn't like Three Billboards, but I respect McDonagh for taking his lewd, vulgar screwballs in directions without a compass and leaving viewers wondering where in the world the film will go next.
3496	5	a	The film is allergic to insight: It's as numbed-out as its hero addict.
3497	4	a	One of those cruel-yet-very-funny crowd pleasers.
3498	1	a	a showcase opportunity for national treasure Bruce Dern.
3499	2	a	Spy Kids is a hoot, offering fun for adults and children alike.
3500	0	a	Yet another of the brilliant Terry Gilliam's wonderful, witty flights of fancy.
3501	1	a	This is the true reboot of the franchise, the film in which, three movies into his tenure, Daniel Craig becomes the best James Bond there ever was.
3502	4	a	it is a thrill to see a horror movie concerned with more than how many cool ways they can gross us out
3503	0	a	This bittersweet Swedish film captures childhood as good as any ever made.
3504	3	a	Such a lyrical, moving independent film is a rare thing to find; Songcatcher is gorgeously made, perfectly cast and thoroughly engaging.
3505	3	a	A well-made entry in the fashionable caper-movie genre, which has gathered steam lately with Ocean's Eleven and others.
3506	3	a	A disorganized but occasionally brilliant movie about two college students and the world they, and we, inhabit.
3507	3	a	If Johnny Depp's barmy stumble through the yo-ho-hum Pirates sequel was playtime rehash, then his loathsome portrayal of the pestilent aristocrat Earl of Rochester shows an actor still daring to push the margins of his persona.
3508	5	a	Like Clint Eastwood in his spaghetti Westerns, Pearce does all his acting with his eyes. And it's riveting. But Michod's script gives him little to depict beyond sadness and angry brooding.
3509	4	a	Barry Levinson is a case study in narrative schizophrenia, with no idea what he wants his film to be.
3510	5	a	Whole swathes of the film make zero sense, scenes feel completely disconnected and whilst it's certainly not as bad as you expect, it's nowhere near as good as you'd hope.
3511	4	a	Goddard does a good job of bringing the characters to life....a treat for the fans
3512	4	a	Ronan is the monarch of the lens in this feisty, feminist royal biopic, which favours queenly clashes over battlefield action.
3513	3	a	It rambles over hill and dale and mountain and field and forest and marsh and through cavern and catacomb and grotto and pothole...but will please the Tolkien faithful.
3514	6	a	Seemingly at every juncture, the finality so necessary to up the stakes of this story is quickly snatched away in order to tease a sequel or two, leaving you wondering what the point of this supernatural exercise was in the first place.
3515	2	a	The piece finds a balance between the tearjerkers caught in the crossfire and the reckless bidders who don't seem to feel troubled for the life of excess at the expense of others.
3516	1	a	If David O. Russell's earlier movies sometimes felt like an attempt to create layered, Kid A-style concept albums, American Hustle feels more like him onstage at the Silverdome, banging out the loudest open chord he can and hip thrusting at the audience.
3517	4	a	A clumsily made but disarming enough movie about the joys of getting away with everything.
3518	7	a	Whereas you only needed a single finger to play the game, not one brain cell is required to process this busy, fizzy, empty-calorie calamity.
3519	4	a	Beer is a source of silicon, a mineral which helps strengthening bones. Offering proof of this is Jackass: the Movie.
3520	3	a	A clever, complex, and comic caper that takes its share of unexpected twists and turns.
3521	2	a	The action in this movie is the key to what makes it fun. Who cares about the plot, character, story or even physics at this point. If it looks cool on screen, it works.
3522	9	a	Shudderingly awful. You'll need a shower.
3523	4	a	A forgettable comedy that shoul've been better written. [Full review in Spanish]
3524	9	a	It might have worked if everyone involved had maybe cared a little more and/or tied everything together, but instead, we get dangling ball sacks, pointless Holocaust jokes and the declaration that throwing bloody tampons is both funny and empowering.
3525	0	a	McDonagh takes things in directions that defy expectation and gives a refreshing amount of credit to his audience to join in on the ride.
3526	4	a	"Despite the post-doctoral double-talk in ""I Origins,"" the movie's faith remains in the mysteries of the cosmos, and it all starts to feel a little wet."
3527	4	a	"As its generic name of the family that Americans strive to keep up with, ""The Joneses"" is an insightful, if not especially scathing, satire from debut director/co-writer Derrick Borte about consumerist manipulation."
3528	4	a	Teen sex, drugs, drinking pop up in satire on materialism.
3529	3	a	As the movie reaches its delirious climax with the American Dreamz finale that brings all the disparate characters together, it's purely delightful. You might hate yourself for laughing at a some of the jokes, but you will laugh.
3530	6	a	...sadly the film never achieves any rapport with the audience.
3531	4	a	The sequel to Steve Harvey's hit takes us to Las Vegas, with hilarious, yet predictable and overdone scenarios.
3532	3	a	As engaging and complete a portrait as we are ever likely to get.
3533	5	a	all gloss and pizzazz but mostly pizz and no azz.
3534	3	a	Despite being too bloody for its own good, Land is a different breed of walking-dead movie -- one with soul.
3535	4	a	McDormand plays the exact opposite of her role in Almost Famous, and darned if she isn't just as terrific.
3536	4	a	High school... Vanessa Hudgens... kids making music. We know what you're thinking, but you're wrong.
3537	8	a	It's hard to imagine ever laughing again after being steamrolled by this juggernaut of lameness.
