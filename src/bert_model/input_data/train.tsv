0	1	a	Exactly the kind of slam-bang adventure that's certain to please audiences of all ages.
1	2	a	Needless to say, this freewheeling parade of bizarreness is not everyone's cup of shrim. Chances are good that the people whose cup of shrim it is already know who they are.
2	3	a	Almodovar adopts a playfully wicked attitude, similar to the one director James Whale used on Bride of Frankenstein... Almodovar is clearly relishing peeling back layer after layer of this peculiar onion.
3	3	a	I have nothing against the film for what it is. I'm just not wild about what it is.
4	4	a	Both the film and the book retain the echoing emptiness of a self-published work, a feeling that this is a one-dimensional vanity project produced without the benefit of an editor or censor or any corrective balance.
5	1	a	The characters are so good that you'll forget about the con game.
6	0	a	Berg makes a compelling case that this is THE scandal of an American generation.
7	5	a	It is a tedious marathon of smoke and mirrors. In terms of the basic requirements of three-reel drama the film lacks substance, credibility, a decent script and characters you might actually care for.
8	2	a	Most proms don't involve choreographed dances, losers winning prom queen or cameos by famous bands. Bart Got A Room is a much needed believable look at the big night.
9	2	a	High energy levels and some genuinely hilarious set pieces make this kids' alien-invasion romp a lot more fun than expected. It's not, erm, rocket science, but it's a thoroughly entertaining ride from start to finish.
10	0	a	It stars the somewhat homely Toni Collette as Muriel, whose whole purpose in life is to get married. How she does that and what happens after that are a couple of the many delightful surprises in this film.
11	1	a	Lee captures the despair, self-delusion, occasional terror and frequent humor of a praised and popular novel, aided by the potent acting his direction virtually guarantees.
12	6	a	Thematically, this WWII drama is a typical John Wayne fare--the Duke imparts lessons of manhood and honor--but technically, it's an atypical Preminger movie, slow-paced and shapeless. 
13	8	a	Silver Linings Playbook may well be my favourite movie of the year. Go see it. Like, right now.
14	6	a	The narrative is infused with chilling facts, and the filmmakers know how to build their case, but a drama demands more.
15	3	a	Eastwood's hands-off directing normally leaves much to desire. But with Mystic River's powerful house cast and emotional gut-wretching story, one respects the lack of showiness and triteness.
16	4	a	Is it possible to satirize something that, in and of itself, often crosses the line into self-parody?
17	2	a	Hilarious.
18	2	a	Seems the committee of five who wrote the script couldn't make lightning strike twice even though they cleverly flip the gender so girls can fight for their right to party.
19	1	a	Fantastical tale of the reptile that conquered the Wild West.
20	6	a	The ''funny'' moments are whiffed, the dialogue is ''scene-y,'' and each reaction shot is held a second or ten too long, leaving the actors hanging.
21	3	a	No Country for Old Men is a thoroughly compelling exercise in the cinema of suspense that proves the power of the old-school thriller remains undiminished.
22	1	a	The year's foremost animation showstopper.
23	0	a	Yimou's explosive imagination threatens to burst the seams of the movie screen...sublime, luscious filmmaking.
24	3	a	Land of the Dead is a horror flick, but not a screamy one -- the booming soundtrack pumps up the drama, and the gore induces squirms, but zombies more titillate than anything.
25	5	a	The picture is all over the map. Nothing coheres.
26	5	a	Mark Felt is a kind of hagiography, and it leans toward whitewashing its subject's legacy.
27	0	a	It's a terrific movie with a great, star-making performance by Nick Robinson.
28	4	a	It's hard not to stifle a tear at the emotional climax, and cinematographer Monika Lenczewska does a particularly handsome job evoking the milieu.
29	5	a	By the time The Green Hornet collapses into a mess of hackneyed car chases and flying glass and bullets, it feels less like the promised irreverent take on the superhero genre, and more like the latest iteration of the Rush Hour movies. 
30	4	a	Cranston is excellent: we pick up on the barely perceptible flicker of fear in his eyes as he brazenly weaves his story. And Kruger impresses in a crucial supporting role.
31	9	a	I'm sure that playing the game for an hour is much more fun than this movie. [Full review in Spanish]
32	4	a	American Dreamz has plenty of laughs. You'll leave the theater feeling not outraged but actually rather cheerful.
33	5	a	Ultimately unsatisfying, not as laugh-out-loud funny as it promises to be in the opening.
34	4	a	Surprisingly inventive...
35	0	a	Eastwood tells the story simply, barely moving the camera. The only special effect in this film is genius.
36	3	a	Love, Simon is an earnest coming-of-age story, gentle and generous, with a captivating performance from Nick Robinson as the titular Simon.
37	4	a	Teller is hot stuff now, but he isn't Robert De Niro, not yet.
38	5	a	The fear in the middle section that everything may get very, very, very stupid - which it will, and how - is more terrifying than any of the lame kills.
39	0	a	A movie with the sweet soul of Toy Story and the boisterous spirit of Spy Kids.
40	3	a	This is a respectful and complex work of fiction around the concepts of the biblical character and his life.
41	9	a	This isn't a real horror movie-this is the kind of horror movie that the characters in a real horror movie watch in order to comment on the lameness of the genre before their authentic terrors begin.
42	1	a	Hrebejk furthers his country's reputation for cinematic absurdity as the only sane artistic reaction to political insanity.
43	1	a	The Bond movie every James Bond fan, new or old, will want to see.
44	6	a	Great acting by Keener, Downey, and Foxx but far too long and too many ECUs. More Keener would have helped. She's something special.
45	3	a	The film, despite never venturing into uncharted territory, is funny, warm, and endearing, and features a protagonist who grows on the audience.
46	5	a	A giant black hole in the center of the comedy universe sucking in the best ideas and situations from other entities into an inescapable ride to nothingness.
47	4	a	How much you'll enjoy Billion Dollar Movie probably comes down to your tolerance for extreme gross out humor.
48	4	a	The rich soundtrack is one of the highlights of this solid, unfamiliar story in which most of the actors do all their own singing.
49	10	a	It's sheer, unadulterated pain.
50	3	a	The main strength of this film is not its message, but rather its rich characterizations.
51	2	a	Earns its place as one piece of a pop-culture puzzle, a genuine reflection of a period that still echoes throughout the culture.
52	2	a	As frustrating as it is, Tyler Perry's The Single Moms Club is an insightful, fascinating and often entertaining picture.
53	3	a	Fight Club is not just a movie, but a wake up call to a disenfranchised generation sick of being told by advertising what to drive, wear, buy, smoke, drink and eat in order to be cool.
54	5	a	Feels like an amalgamation of other animated films' styles and storylines, assembled by a marketing department bent on hitting a demographic sweet spot rather than artists following their muse.
55	3	a	Works as guilty pleasure; there are plenty of great laughs which sustain the film despite its faults.
56	9	a	This is nothing but an attempt to cash in on the success of Gettysburg.
57	5	a	Max Payne? Maximum Payne in the butt more like.
58	2	a	This raunchy teen comedy more than earns its R-rating ... but it does so with a lot of heart.
59	3	a	Woo outwits, outgadgets, outstunts and outdirects the original with one hand tied behind his back.
60	4	a	Sometimes it's more jock than jocular. Occasionally, the camera lens lingers on Owen Wilson's crooked schnoz or Reese Witherspoon's prudish grimaces a bit too long. But it's is never too cute, except in omitting the question mark from its title.
61	3	a	Crank: High Voltage promises something outrageous and then over-delivers, permanently deflowering and deforming the mind of anyone lucky enough to be in the audience.
62	5	a	Clumsy and clunky, totally lacking in passion and cohesion, this dull mediocrity is an insult to Philippa Gregory's historical concept of the two rival sisters.
63	3	a	Essentially a red-state Ocean's Eleven - a fizzy, twisty Southern-fried heist flick that's more enjoyable the less you try to dissect it.
64	2	a	The Break-Up is a refreshingly different romantic comedy, one that doesn't so much rely on gimmicks as on digging around for genuine feelings.
65	7	a	If you are looking for a laugh this weekend, you might want to look elsewhere.
66	3	a	Overrated yet nonetheless well done.
67	4	a	Decent sequel. Kinda cartoonish, but lots of good fights. Better than Rocky IV.
68	5	a	Glaudini expects character tics to substitute for plot development.
69	5	a	As a thriller, The Tourist makes a good travelogue.
70	6	a	This is most certainly not as good as it gets.
71	0	a	More action-filled and tense than The Bourne Identity.
72	6	a	There is nothing particularly wonderful about Timeline, but, other than Walker's acting, nothing particularly terrible about it, either.
73	3	a	Death does not become him
74	5	a	a blow-to-the-crotch, boobie-shot kind of comedy
75	1	a	With the help of his cast, Sayles fashions Babys into a passionately interesting social discourse. He slips in touches of irony, and beautiful moments of raw sentiment.
76	7	a	This guy knows how to tell stories for audiences who can hold their own hands, thank you.
77	4	a	Mercifully, the audacious Lee keeps his goofy stylistic technique a bit more in check than in some of his other films, but a little goes a long way and still tends to undermine the storytelling ability of his work.
78	3	a	Quirks of accents aside, Invictus is an uplifting film. Its African-inspired soundtrack is spot on, too. So, go ahead -- it'll make your day.
79	4	a	Book-based romantic drama about a married woman's affair. 
80	6	a	Though it spotlights a great performance, this isn't a great musical biography, largely due to the splintered nature of the storytelling.
81	4	a	...In the end you just really feel sorry for Mark Hamill, I mean really can't he get better parts than in unfunny comedies?
82	0	a	A coming-of-age story exploring one's first experience with true love and sexual uncertainty, including the hypnotic pleasures of both physical and intellectual affection balanced against bittersweet heartbreak
83	2	a	Entertaining and enjoyable.
84	4	a	A strong cast and some interesting relationships make this a worthwhile entry, although the denouement is lamentably laughable.
85	5	a	"Not helping matters is the DTV quality of the filmmaking, with ""The Cloverfield Paradox"" offering a wildly inconsistent tone and poor casting."
86	0	a	"[VIDEO] More than just a brilliant documentary, ""Project Nim"" is a unique cinematic experience. "
87	4	a	[H]ow else are you going to tap into that lucrative market consisting of folks who read the books but are too lazy to read subtitles?
88	5	a	Well and truly geared to a female audience who are likely to savour the fanciful plot and neatly wrapped feel-good denouement.
89	5	a	Yet another tale of disaffected, overprivileged teens.
90	9	a	Even in the dubious genre of movies based on video games, Resident Evil is an abomination.
91	4	a	On what planet does Diane Lane, she of the double-dip-sundae bod, whipped-cream face, and cinnamon hair, go dateless? Only on planet Hollywood, where she is routinely cast as an underappreciated wife or overlooked single.
92	6	a	The good news is that Jolie and Depp accessorize nicely together. He rarely gets to spar with women in his weight class, and his slovenly approach to stardom might be the antidote for Jolie's solemnity.
93	5	a	It's less a movie than a salute to a troubled moment in our history, a movie so steeped in nobility that you half expect it to swoon with reverence for itself.
94	1	a	An edge-of-your-seater that will have folks thinking twice before taking a road trip across America.
95	3	a	For me, this is sublime poetry. Pitt's performance grows in majesty as things progress, while Affleck is absolutely mesmerizing as the fame-hungry Ford.
96	3	a	The odd-couple road movie is well-trod territory, so it's a welcome surprise to see it handled as intelligently, deftly and movingly as it is in Stephen Frears' Philomena.
97	2	a	American Hustle is an ambitious satire, made by an accomplished filmmaker and loaded with terrific acting talent; but despite appreciating it for what it tried to achieve instead, it's hard not to feel slightly conned.
98	4	a	Light, breezy, and actually funny.
99	0	a	Spielberg has not only touched the nerve of the American psyche, he has ripped it out, stomped on it and beat it with a club for a full two hours. This is the doomsday hour
100	5	a	While there are laughs to be had, on a whole Veber's new film is an unfunny and offensive disaster, wasting a truckload of rich comedic talent in the process.
101	5	a	History is on the side of the protesters, who were right to shout about government corruption and the Vietnam War, so a contemporary film needs to more than just take their side.
102	3	a	It could have been handled better, perhaps, but there is enough about it that works to make it worth watching.
103	3	a	It's eye candy that detonates.
104	0	a	The power of Ava DuVernay's astonishing film comes from its understanding of the limits of King's work as much as its celebration of his achievements.
105	5	a	Silly talking dog movie with some violence, serious themes. 
106	1	a	The jokes are surprisingly on-target and fresh, with few misfires.
107	4	a	Mr. Kazan keeps the courtship bouncing between the emotional and the ludicrous.
108	3	a	The most striking thing about the film is the use of color. First-time director Neal Slavin has the kind of eye for color one would expect from an award-winning photographer.
109	3	a	[Friedkin] has retained his touch ... all these years later. And in Matthew McConaughey, he has the perfect vehicle for madness.
110	5	a	"Does The Imitation Game fudge the edges of its hero's biography? Guilty. But there's artistic truth to the maxim uttered at the end of John Ford's The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance: ""When the legend becomes fact, print the legend."
111	3	a	A beautifully nuanced script, Bening at her best, and superb against-type performances by Watts and Jackson, make this a must-see film for, and about, women -- especially mothers.
112	3	a	Director Nick Cassavetes should be commended for the unflinching manner in which he tells the story -- it packs a punch, although it lingers too long to be truly unsettling.
113	2	a	The story is well written and incredibly smart, but probably a bit too spiritual for western audiences.
114	1	a	With his sharp instincts and exhausted wisdom, the character of Gunther offers us a bittersweet reminder of Hoffman's gifts in what is his last completed film.
115	4	a	Fascinating if one-sided examination of the power of religious cults and the methods they employ to attract new members.
116	6	a	It's the first Woody Allen film in which impotence has become the situation rather than the problem. This is a movie about a guy who has given up.
117	6	a	My theory is that Jared is Aquaman, and he's probing the ocean with his mental powers, looking for intelligent life. Which is why he never finds the screenwriter down there.
118	3	a	Still Alice works and, at times, with assured, depressing clarity.
119	8	a	Our culture is headed down the toilet with the ferocity of a frozen burrito after an all-night tequila bender - and I know this because I've seen 'jackass: the movie.'
120	5	a	It took a century of innovation in the field of cinematic special effects, but finally the head of Marlon Wayans could be successfully grafted onto the body of a baby.
121	6	a	You could watch Crossover, or you could check out the Salvation Army gift shop to see what inspirational bumper stickers they're peddling.
122	4	a	A big step down from Goldfinger, but still moderately entertaining.
123	3	a	It's the texture and the feel of the film, rather than the actual plot itself, that makes it so effective
124	6	a	The film fails at creating characters with credible emotional textures, a task easily, and vividly, demonstrated by Pixar time and time again.
125	3	a	A fascinating tall tale until the incredible Tilda Swinton appears, vulnerable, full of regrets and compelling us to start thinking, but from then on, this is a tour de force.
126	5	a	Everything about this film smacks of laziness.
127	3	a	The young cast is more sure of themselves shooting hoops than showing emotion, but Jackson holds the screen so well that he gives them extra focus and presence. 
128	3	a	This film stands ably on its own, offering up generous piles of large scale fantasy underscored by genuine emotional heft and boundary-pushing visuals.
129	3	a	MacFarlane is after something beyond absurdity. He gets to the crux of the matter, that life in the West was cheap, at least as portrayed in the movies, and he tells us, often hilariously, that this is nothing we should celebrate.
130	4	a	Two of the most fascinating people in the world in a movie that is not their best but still entertaining
131	3	a	Abbott's feral depiction of such fierce loyalty is something close to brilliant.
132	4	a	Maybe two and a half hours is pushing things juuuuuust a touch.
133	3	a	This Internet-promoted lark about a Hawaii-to-L.A. flight besieged by a frenzied tangle of snakes is hilariously funny, full of fang-popping scares, and guaranteed to increase travel by train.
134	2	a	Engagingly unsettling with a lot of thrilling psychological elements
135	3	a	Comes at Night will not be perfect, but you can't deny the great talent of this director who with just two films in his filmography, promises to be a force to be taken into account. [Full review in Spanish]
136	3	a	The film is very good at capturing the camaraderie of the soldiers -- and the sometimes desperate way in which they rely on one another.
137	0	a	The intelligent and clever script has enough humor to break the tension periodically.
138	3	a	A story of particularly streamlined, eloquent despair.
139	3	a	Performances are realistic and unpretentious, and the backbone of this observant movie by a director-writer with a promising future.
140	4	a	Jack Black and Cate Blanchett are fantastic...dare I say, I'd like to see Eli Roth do some more stuff like this.
141	1	a	Apatow simply knows funny when he sees it, and he gives his actors' ample opportunity to plumb all possible comic depths.
142	3	a	A must-see artifact and lots of fun.
143	2	a	The fear is not so much of physical danger, but of just the impenetrability of the mystery.
144	3	a	With Killer Joe, a black comedy thriller adapted from a play by Tracy Letts, Friedkin seems to have recaptured some of that youthful energy.
145	4	a	Luke Wilson's terrific performance renders an uneasy hybrid of crime drama, comedy and ecommerce far more compelling than it otherwise would be.
146	9	a	This is a wedding date that would have benefited from a different designer, a more knowing caterer, and -- most of all -- a whole new guest list.
147	1	a	A holiday drama that depicts the miracle of forgiveness in the midst of a storm of familial conflict and misunderstandings.
148	1	a	Murnau's horror masterwork features a treasure-trove of silent film techniques, unearthly locations and a truly horrid vampire played by Max Schreck.
149	1	a	This is a case of a director finding a way to convey things visually so that the story is enhanced.
150	6	a	Roscoe Jenkins labors too hard to wring too-few chuckles.
151	5	a	I suspect it's supposed to be a heart-warming drama. It left my heart lukewarm, and there's precious little drama.
152	3	a	A lurid, lightweight throw-together of cheap psycho-thrills which tries to dress itself up as something more substantial.
153	1	a	This may be the most accessible of Kaurismaki's films.
154	4	a	A blatant attempt to cash in on the success of March of the Penguins, this wildlife documentary is stunningly photographed, but the attempts at anthropomorphism are frequently irritating.
155	9	a	A tiresome, humourless, lifeless, overlong dirge in which the lofty pretention to say something deep about the quest for self and the female condition all gets blown away by an insipid, off-the-shelf romantic-movie ending.
156	1	a	"Luckily, the genre has not submerged completely and, with the help of films like ""The Incredibles"", hope for a solid future is within the audience's grasp."
157	3	a	Maureen O'Hara, born in Ireland, was never more ravishing than here on her home ground.
158	1	a	An intoxicating cocktail of splendid visuals, spectacular action, state-of-the-art computer-generated imagery and some old-fashioned swashbuckling worthy of Hollywood's Golden Age.
159	4	a	While it doesn't necessarily break much new ground, its makers are also smart enough to not try to do more than they have the means to convincingly accomplish.
160	9	a	Daddy D-Day for Cuba's career.
161	3	a	Whatever pickle he gets himself in, we can't help but root for Menashe.
162	4	a	Once you've got over the off-putting aspects, Kim's personal journey becomes quite engaging, though you may wish the film was a bit meatier politically.
163	4	a	A pleasant diversion.
164	3	a	John Curran creates room for his characters to think and feel and an environment that encourages us to do the same.
165	0	a	While some may find its strange, stream-of-consciousness approach to be grating, others will be enthralled with each and every gorgeously composed frame.
166	3	a	Plenty of action is here in this exciting remake of the earlier classic.
167	6	a	It's the film's earnest delivery and good intentions that give it whatever value it has.
168	3	a	Based on Andre Aciman's novel, this gorgeous-looking and beautifully atmospheric film has echoes of all sorts of good things, including Guadagnino's A Bigger Splash and I Am Love. 
169	6	a	It all comes down to chemistry, and Depp and Jolie don't have it. At least not in these roles.
170	4	a	'Bandslam' is far from exceptional, but is saved by decent character development, a cluster of engaging performances and several amusing deadpan moments.
171	5	a	Every bit the disposable piece of piffle you think it's going to be, Dickie Roberts: Former Child Star is nonetheless mildly enjoyable.
172	2	a	I like the characters and the story but find that the film just doesn't go the distance in some areas.
173	9	a	There are stupid stoner comedies and then there are stupid stoner comedies that ain't funny, and the latest effluvium from Adam Sandler's Happy Madison production company is mostly a bummer.
174	4	a	Eastwood hits all the right notes in exactly the right order, but it's his least personal film for a while.
175	5	a	Compared to those prodigious in-your-face fakes, alley oops and slam dunks, the movie's trite, trash-talking dialogue and drippy do-the-right-thing message fall as flat as an airball.
176	1	a	The characters are off-kilter and even weird, but watching them one senses their strange behavior occurs because of who they are, not because they're putting on a performance.
177	9	a	McDonagh works way too hard to inject nearly every scene with his patented solution of acid wit and dark-roast comedy... It's jarringly effective until it starts to feel like shtick, at which point it works only as a numbing agent. 
178	5	a	You know you're in trouble when even the film's title remains a mystery.
179	5	a	The longer the conclusion drags, the more attractive the exit sign looks.
180	0	a	With a low budget but a lot of imagination and talent, director Trevorrow and writer Connolly create a deceptively simple comedy that's one of the most entertaining films of the year. 
181	5	a	A pretentious regurgitation of worn-out sci-fi cliches by a novice filmmaker who had yet to find his way.
182	3	a	Even though the outcome is no secret, you're still invested in Vinny every step and jab of the way. 
183	3	a	With excellent performances, plays on morality and sexual behavior, Brewer composes another surefire classic.
184	3	a	We can see the wheels turning, and we might resent it sometimes, but this is still a nice little picture, made by bright and friendly souls with a lot of good cheer.
185	4	a	It's exuberant, exhilarating, poetic and -- intentionally and not -- rather silly.
186	4	a	"I Origins"" ... earns its creepy stripes in a memorable way, making us feel uneasy about what the characters are doing."
187	3	a	it was the best of times, it was the worst of times.
188	6	a	A floundering action comedy with an interesting premise that self-destructs in its second half.
189	4	a	There is a sense of enchantment to this title, and an exuberance that emanates off the narrative, as the celebratory mood of the characters extends to the viewer.
190	9	a	Barbequed Doggie Zombies. If your heart just skipped a beat and you find yourself atingle with anticipation, then I wish you good luck and Godspeed and there's no need for you to read further
191	4	a	Dumb and silly and fun, just not as dumb and silly and fun as I'd hoped it would be.
192	3	a	A big, Harry family adventure full of laughs.
193	0	a	Engrossing thriller over the loss of faith.
194	6	a	Where the movie really stumbles is with co-writer/director Philip Kaufman's attempts to make it a conventional mystery-thriller. Kaufman simply doesn't have the slightest notion of how to make a conventional film of any kind.
195	4	a	While Fanboys has moments of success, it is mostly a middling road picture that doesn't do a lot more than any average, forgettable entry into the tired genre.
196	4	a	Watching Sally Field is one of the pleasures of going to the movies. 'Doris' doesn't always give her the material she deserves. But even when the film fails her, Field never fails to shine. 
197	3	a	Diminishing returns set in after the first series of beating, but the film is a stunner, a must-see whatever your beliefs.
198	1	a	This great American fable is buoyed by its unwavering faith in the wealth of the human spirit.
199	0	a	A film that crosses generations and cultural barriers: watching it, it's hard not to feel like a kid again.
200	2	a	The samba and bossa nova beats arent just score; they comprise the very environment of the film, as fundamental a force as the wind or the sun
201	0	a	Directed beautifully, Hoffman seems to have the whole film under lock and key, but pads around cagily, watchfully, as if prowling the perimeter to stop an imminent burglary.
202	3	a	Yimou's latest performance art is truly less concerned with the politics of a country than it is with the politics of the human heart.
203	0	a	Hurt and Davis at their peaks in a touching, well-crafted drama
204	3	a	Visually, as with all Peter Weir's films, this is really outstanding and really quite memorable. 
205	3	a	Smokin'.
206	3	a	As far as light, brainless summer entertainment goes, it makes the grade.
207	3	a	Complex, compassionate and endlessly illuminating...
208	3	a	Selma's showcasing of individual moments over the educational arc helps to make this saga feel immediate, not preordained but unfolding as a series of actions, planned and unplanned. 
209	4	a	A classic in the coolest sense of the word
210	5	a	Western action-comedy set in bordello; lots of gunfire.
211	3	a	Three Kryptonian villains and Superman kicking the snot out of each other and tearing up the town? Who can't love this?
212	9	a	A perfect storm of wooden acting, hackneyed direction, inane scripting and laughably cartoonish special effects produces a shapeless mess more wearyingly stupid than arch-villian Dr. Doom is evil.
213	3	a	Kaurismaki's movies can tickle you with the briefest of statements, the smallest of gestures.
214	3	a	Jenkins scripts and directs a warm, heartfelt character study with tons of great little moments
215	4	a	A mixed bag of mixed moods.
216	6	a	Movies based on video games are shallow, obvious and one-dimensional.
217	6	a	A pervasive sense of bleakness soon swallows the movie whole.
218	3	a	Precise and moody, and a terrific look at how misplaced priorities and ingrained racism and xenophobia thwart intelligence machines that can operate with such frightening efficiency.
219	6	a	...the movie turns into a game of spot the cameo more than anything else.
220	2	a	Then again, few people can wear a clerical uniform to great distinction the way Hawke does here, conveying his eventual downfall into ethical submission with utter tranquility.
221	0	a	A full-bodied, melancholy-tinged ode to the resiliency of mankind.
222	6	a	Although there are some fun sequences and genuine wonder to behold, the film is a pandering, noisy, visual mess with a thin plot and even thinner characters.
223	4	a	The film doesn't really go deep enough -- and niggling details subvert its veracity.
224	6	a	the climatic interweaving of the narrative strands feels profoundly anticlimatic, delivering a modicum of emotional payoff but little else
225	3	a	The lack of climax and the ambiguous resolution cut closer to the bone than most summer fare, but the screenplay, by two writers making their feature debut, stays formulaic enough to never really draw blood.
226	4	a	As date movies goe, this misanthropic misfire is briefly amusing but instantly forgettable.
227	9	a	While the actors in Daddy Day Camp may be different, the tired and predictable storyline full of jokes involving urinating, flatulence, burping, vomiting and crotch shots remains the same.
228	6	a	Nothing but the coach's gutsy move and the fact that it really happened distinguishes this movie from a litany of past basketball dramas.
229	4	a	Ang Lee's technical artistry is indisputable, but his experiment with visual hyperclarity comes off as artificial when we most need it to be natural, organic and whisper-close.
230	4	a	Chappaquiddick is at its best when it is underpinned by a somber orchestral score, focusing closely on the personal anguish of its protagonist.
231	0	a	...the kind of film that Menahem Golan and Yoram Globus would have released under the Cannon label. 
232	3	a	An acting masterclass delivered by some of Hollywood's best. 
233	1	a	Few studio-supported films match its B-movie nirvana of stupid-goodness. It's exactly what its title suggests and more ? the proof in the primal levels ranging from basic exploited fears to the crowd?s roaring reactions and howls of humor or horror.
234	4	a	Subversive enough for older brother, sweet enough for kid sis, this cine-panto's a safe if not spectacular choice for a Chrimbo family outing. The cartoon chipmunk almost steals it, but Adams' dippy dazzle is the movie's heart, soul and lungs.
235	4	a	Thick with powerful, understated, deeply empathetic performances -- and it needs them. It's hard to feel sorry for a bunch of welfare cases who sit around drinking and barely even trying to find new jobs.
236	9	a	Feigns compassion for the mentally challenged, but treats Radio as a pet, a toy, a prop.
237	2	a	Here's the biggest problem most folks will have with Bee Movie: It's not Ratatouille.
238	3	a	It's funny, non-stop inventive and heroically heretical.
239	3	a	That there's nothing definitive to wrap your arms around is frustrating. And intriguing.
240	4	a	Friedkin's direction is rough and ready, but Letts's tangy writing is the star here.
241	0	a	Rarely has a slice-of-life film been so delicious to consume.
242	5	a	Larry isn't an evil movie, but it is a symptom of the problems inherent in gross-out humor.
243	1	a	a loud, full-throttled, bombastic heist flick with no apologies for its obsessions with speed, violence, intensity,
244	6	a	A comedy that's actually funny.
245	5	a	The Predator feels like a haphazardly assembled and overflowing buffet plate, and how much you enjoy it will depend on your ability to deal with its whiplash-wild inconsistency in tone and missed opportunities.
246	3	a	"YOu know, the ""Final Destination"" movies contain characters who are self-obsessed, cheap, profane and mean-spirited. Maybe that's why it's so much fun to watch them get taken out, one by one."
247	1	a	The film manages to cross all barriers; it should be accessible to both children and adults, Brits and Yanks, rats and chickens.
248	4	a	Uncertain but uplifting.
249	5	a	Snipes at his coolest still can't save this xenophobic piece of studio flotsam.
250	3	a	Quietly shedding all the fussy baggage of 'heritage drama', Campion gives us a moving account of Keats' great love and tragic death. A film of pictorial beauty and authenticity, graced with a fine cast.
251	4	a	The special effects are noteworthy and then of course, there are Vin Diesel's heroics.
252	1	a	Uproarious. While keeping your funny bone occupied, quietly reaches for your heart bone. Yes, it's coarse, okay, vulgar, and crude. Alas, the title doesn't promise you tact.
253	3	a	Zhang Yimou's follow-up to Hero oddly feels more like a warm up.
254	4	a	Chan looks as if he's having fun and it rubs off.
255	5	a	The complexity of Felt's motives are left untouched in the interests of having a fiercely principled hero at the film's centre.
256	4	a	Despite hewing fairly closely to the facts, has trouble seeming truthful. Practically everyone behaves like an allegorical symbol rather than a person, a problem the script anticipates and acknowledges but only feebly attempts to solve. [Blu-ray]
257	6	a	Gibson ultimately seems to be preaching to the choir, rejecting standard storytelling conventions such as introducing his characters, assuming his audience already knows everything he's about to tell us.
258	0	a	Its depiction of the primal emotions that constitute our lives is positively enthralling. 
259	4	a	The only sad thing about this film is that it has to break taboos in the first place in this increasingly conservative society... [Full Review in Spanish]
260	3	a	With a shaky, distracting narrative, the film has a number of flaws, but Boseman's ferocious, fearless take on one of the most influential musicians of all time is the best cinematic equivalent to a one-man show you'll see all year.
261	4	a	This is a welcome female-centric variation on a familiar theme, not the first to deal with a teenage girl's de-virginization project, but certainly a minority report in a field crowded with boys trying to Get Some ...
262	5	a	It's one thing to have your heart in the right place and another to lunge at the audience until they're effectively devouring your chest.
263	4	a	Can't get to France this summer? Catch a cinematic ride from Cannes to the Seine in Paris Can Wait.
264	9	a	To say that this vapid vehicle is downright doltish and uneventful is just as obvious as telling a country skunk that he has severe body odor.
265	4	a	Given the lack of Lee screen time, 'Taste' is actually a pretty damn good Hammer film, with a strong story, the usual stock of excellent actors, great costumes, etc.
266	5	a	The third time around is not the charm, but we can only hope this will be the FINAL final destination.
267	9	a	The bar for urban-flavoured dance movies has already been set pretty low, but Battle Of The Year effortlessly leans back and limbos on below it.
268	3	a	It's all attitude, and little substance. Still, its attitude is catchy at times, filled with humor and sparks of energy.
269	3	a	Faster-paced and more chock-full of adventure than the original.
270	8	a	Yes, it's true: in this astonishingly distasteful bit of dreck, there is at the bottom a sappy little romance.
271	0	a	Channeling spaghetti westerns, Cervantes, Castaneda, and a dash of CHINATOWN as refracted through the visual sensibilities of Dali, it is a fiendishly clever concretion of high- and low-brow in a story that is both vision quest and farce
272	3	a	With great performances, a grown-up script and amazing music, Cadillac Records may not change your life, but there's an excellent chance it'll change your record collection, and for the better.
273	0	a	This is a great, great film.
274	4	a	a perfect example of how mood, atmosphere, music, and direction can overcome plot weaknesses
275	3	a	Tim Burton's freshest work, and perhaps the purest embodiment of his funky world view. Count the number of people whose careers were made here; that's no fluke.
276	0	a	I can't imagine a more faithful version than this taut, superbly told, ferociously filmed adventure.
277	6	a	Wobbles like a punch-drunk fighter.
278	5	a	For a film that has pulled a reasonably overqualified cast with solid dramatic chops, it is regretfully short on any characters that stick out in any way whatsoever.
279	0	a	The special effects enchant all -- no matter what your age.
280	6	a	True crime procedurals can have a certain fascination, but not when they're jumbled glimpses of what might or might not have happened involving a lot of empty people whose main claim to fame is that they're dead.
281	4	a	...above-average teen thriller.
282	6	a	Not everyone is crushed by fame, but almost everyone is flattened by it.
283	4	a	Several story and comedy beats are derivative, but scenes of thoughtful insight are frequent enough for The To Do List to offer more than just brainless laughs.
284	5	a	The film suffers from attempting too much, not revelling in the horror tendencies, nor thriving in the more magical, while the romance running through the picture is a challenge to adhere to.
285	3	a	Whether there's anything substantial under the sheen and CGI of Alex Proyas' glistening future vision is debatable, but this enjoyable, engrossing picture is at least intelligently artificial.
286	4	a	See it...then travel back in time and see it again.
287	3	a	A great film, and Stallone's breakout performance. It's about time he had one.
288	5	a	The brain power you expend making sense of it is better spent elsewhere.
289	4	a	As subversive as the The To Do List is ... it's still ultimately familiar and insubstantial fare.
290	3	a	Fairly standard sports-movie fare but well-acted, suitably gritty, lightly comic in the right places and sweet without being saccharine.
291	3	a	Early Man is mostly the same for Aardman Animations: a little eccentric, a little erratic, equally hilarious and gross visually, and consistently amusing.
292	3	a	He [Philip Seymour Hoffman] is cast as a German intelligence operative and there are times when the precision of the accent combines with his husky baritone to bring his dialogue close to poetry.
293	0	a	Although Translation is only [Coppola's] second feature, she already shows signs of being a sensei, as the Japanese call a master.
294	6	a	Proves more irksome than moving.
295	3	a	Manages to gain classic comic book feature status through a combination of great stunts and a great human angle.
296	6	a	A smart and witty romantic farce that mixes sweet and sexy with surprising aplomb.
297	4	a	Seven years after Almost Famous, Patrick Fugit still sports that winning, dorky haircut, bangs flopping over his eyes. He is impossible not to like.
298	4	a	The joke, of course, is that it's really Owen Wilson who's in control. He can't play the dazed rogue forever, but for now he's the happy master of that domain.
299	9	a	What's the worst foreign journey you've ever experienced? Mine is this movie.
300	4	a	I found myself so disappointed by the formulaic elements, which all but take over the narrative, that my enthusiasm became more and more diminished the longer the movie played.
301	2	a	Poses a number of intriguing questions about the nature of maternity, only to obscure them with a gloss that is equal parts sentiment and subtle but specious politics.
302	4	a	Hotel for Dogs is light entertainment with plenty of dog action for adults an kids alike.
303	4	a	Enjoyable but light on substance...
304	9	a	Repugnant
305	5	a	Jonah Hex is cut-and-paste filmmaking at its crudest.
306	4	a	In a free-for-all like this, where the laws of gravity and dictates of narrative logic are left to eat dust, it doesn't matter when anything takes place or why.
307	5	a	[An] overlong, overproduced spectacle.
308	3	a	...succeeds as theater, as entertainment, but it doesn't really attempt what Terrace tried, in his admittedly morally clumsy way. What is the light in those feral eyes and what does it mean? Can we ever hope to know?
309	9	a	A devastatingly misguided piece of work, significantly lacking in the sort of depth that it so surely believed itself to posses.
310	5	a	It's a cult-film venture, with its own built-in geek fan base.
311	0	a	Simple and nicely convoluted at the same time.
312	3	a	Thanks to Field's ability to give data entry clerk Doris Miller a consistent sense of dignity, it's easy to cheer for a character who'd be an eccentric or even annoying supporting character in other films.
313	3	a	Field proves more than capable of delivering Showalter-level goofiness while giving the film its heart.
314	3	a	The problem comes when we realize it's a Tommy Lee Jones film and the title is more than just a random coincidence. It's a really good film that was almost great.
315	4	a	Fantastic Four is essentially campy fun; this is the sort of movie Schumacher's Batman and Robin was trying to be.
316	4	a	Moondi and his actors let Alex and Justin sketch their own stories, which are written in their faces and in the bad choices they habitually make.
317	2	a	McGuigan's role is essentially to serve the script and the performers, and we can be grateful the project wasn't handed to a director more bent on imposing an authorial stamp.
318	2	a	Cheaply made stuff, patently stupid and, most of the time, a pure pleasure to watch.
319	5	a	Chris Brown gets punched in the face, so it's not a total wash.
320	2	a	James Cameron's latest memorial to the spirit that exists mournfully and sadly in utter silence as the effects of time and salinity slowly and inexorably take their toll.
321	3	a	Even when the streamers, confetti, and brass bands aren't there, you can see and hear them.
322	3	a	Although hardly 'Blazing Saddles,' the movie is pretty funny when it depicts the Old West as a place of such 'general depressing awfulness' it can sink a person into 'a disgusting, awful, dirty cesspool of despair.'
323	1	a	If you come from a family that eats, meddles, argues, laughs, kibbitzes and fights together, then go see this delightful comedy.
324	0	a	It's resplendent, it's ravishing.
325	3	a	While there are moments throughout that feel like dramatic contrivances, the best sequences and touches of A Private War could make many viewers forget that they aren't watching a documentary.
326	3	a	The whole film is cracked, but in a stylish, downtown way.
327	3	a	As might be expected in a film that stars two such heavyweights, Talk to Me is a master class in acting. Ejiofor and Cheadle are both terrific, investing their characters with more than just personality, but also with heart and soul.
328	1	a	What could have been a trifling little caper movie becomes, in the hands of Russell and his superb cast, a rich, character-driven film of humor, drama and surprising warmth.
329	3	a	While undeniably flawed, Hitchcock remains a breezy, entertaining show-biz tale. 
330	3	a	If you believe Buffy the Vampire Slayer's Anya, there's something very malevolent about bunnies.
331	0	a	The dialogue of Preston Sturges shoots and shoots, never seems to miss, and convinces you of its genius in around about a minute.
332	0	a	Whaddya expect to happen in a scary, spine-tingler with such a big hint in the title?
333	8	a	I liked 'Anvil' so much that I've been curious to see what [director Sacha Gervasi] could do with a great script. And now, the wait continues. 
334	6	a	It's nothing like life, and not likable enough to get away with it.
335	4	a	The film is raunchy, but not vulgar, and until an unnecessarily preachy climactic moment, very funny.
336	3	a	If nothing else, it's a welcomed alternative to the more straightforward and serious film that Spielberg is likely to deliver.
337	0	a	If you don't cry at this Capra classic, you probably don't have tear ducts....
338	3	a	... thanks to Sally Field's sweet mix of drama and comedy, Hello, My Name is Doris is more than Pretty Woman on hormone replacement therapy, it strikes a universal note by exploring fear.
339	4	a	A satire that pokes fun of the ruses that corporations are willing to undertake in order to get more people purchasing their products.
340	6	a	Couples Retreat is ridiculous and whorish, but the minds behind it are too sharp to simply leave it at that.
341	3	a	Whereas the success of sequels is generally dependent upon how many of the original stars and key filmmaking personnel such as writer and director, this excellent monster movie would stand on its own.
342	2	a	Three Billboards is a momentous achievement, presenting us with a remarkable female character and topical plot about the conspiracy of silence that pervades our culture.
343	4	a	Annette Bening's talent is overwhelming... [Full Review in Spanish] 
344	3	a	Like its celebrated predecessor, All the President's Men, Mark Felt... is essential viewing.
345	3	a	Disney's Treasure Planet adds a unique spin to a classic story which has delighted readers for generations.
346	9	a	Video games are more involving than this mess.
347	4	a	A tragicomedy, between illness and parody, far from the overwhelming effect that Ang Lee is seeking. [Full review in Spanish]
348	3	a	Younger takes care to keep things rooted in the real and he's aided by Teller and Eckhart, who give it their all in a movie that ultimately celebrates the simple power of living for the thing you love most.
349	7	a	So many body parts from other engineered romantic comedies have been crudely harvested and stitched together in the making of this weird robotic lark that Maid of Honor of Frankenstein might be more useful a nickname.
350	6	a	The Angry Birds Movie plays best to children who are easily entertained, but even they deserve better than this.
351	4	a	Utilizes an alternating formula of motivational speeches and current hip-hop tracks meant to sell Coach Carter soundtracks.
352	6	a	If you're looking for gunning gangsta action on a hot summer night, Waist Deep is an effective-enough story of urban outlaws in love and on the run. It's sweet, sweaty stuff, for a while at least.
353	5	a	Tender, tactile intimacy soon slumps into a set-up more well-visited than Pooh's honey jar.
354	5	a	Wonderland is completely hollow and devoid of purpose... uncompelling, unorganized and unexciting.
355	3	a	A film with an ingenious gimmick, the tone of a cynic, and, somehow, through it all, a conscience.
356	3	a	...strikes a nice balance between starry-eyed romanticism and cynical detachment.
357	3	a	"I like ""Jackass"" and I make no apologies for it."
358	3	a	The pervasive feeling of dread, rather than cheap scares, is what carries the film when it occasionally slips into familiar contrivances
359	3	a	It's an effective, if unfathomable, entry in the Fincher canon.
360	5	a	A muddled mystery.
361	5	a	[A] failure, although with some very interesting moments.
362	3	a	A beautiful movie at times, tapping into a pure experience that's gracefully handled by the production, allowing the work to be educational, dramatically satisfying, and, of course, utterly heartbreaking.
363	5	a	Meanders in a slow, tiresome way.
364	2	a	Amistad is a solidly made film. It's just no...well, you know [Schindler's List].
365	3	a	One of the sexiest and most joyful road movies in some time.
366	6	a	Despite its glimmers of self-awareness, Paper Towns works neither as a teen romance nor as a subversion of the same.
367	1	a	There are moments of nasty violence that make us turn our heads away, and there's a scene where a character reads a letter that is some of the most beautiful writing you'll hear in a movie this year.
368	6	a	The parts are better than the sum
369	3	a	Break-Up could be viewed as the ultimate romantic comedy; the rare picture that makes one thank heaven for all the good relationships they've managed to luck into.
370	6	a	If ever there was a movie that could cause even the most restless sleeper to fall into a deep slumber, this is it.
371	4	a	You're likely to leave Invictus with a few nagging questions
372	4	a	Rides on Cranston's abilities to so ably and sensitively portray the average American man torn between his double life. The story itself often seems outlandish, and if it weren't based on a true one, would feel unrealistic and overly contrived. 
373	4	a	You have to respect any movie that name-checks the Velvet Underground and assumes its tweenage viewers will get the reference -- or ask their parents later.
374	9	a	"A disgracefully vapid and horrendously ugly work that makes the likes of ""Doogal"" or ""Happily N'Ever After"" look like ""Pinocchio"" and ""WALL-E"" by comparison."
375	4	a	Yes, it made me want an Eeyore of my own and is perfectly palatable, but it's not the charming kids' adventure some may expect.
376	3	a	The Rover is a hugely stressful tone poem in which on-screen characters are constantly being shot and killed by off-screen characters... [It] at least makes for a better Cormac McCarthy movie than The Counselor did.
377	4	a	By the punishing heft of the big fight, there is the clear hint that the series will soon plunge into an unpalatable patriotic fervour. For now, though, with its leathery texture of working class Philly-life it felt enough like reality. 
378	4	a	It has enough ingredients for a reasonably entertaining fantasy adventure--except, that is, for an interesting lead character with an emotionally compelling hook. 
379	1	a	A wonderfully twisted cinematic expedition into territory rarely traveled.
380	6	a	The film's ultimate failure is that it permanently taints our enjoyment of Hopkins' interpretation, borne of the unwanted knowledge that Lecter is just another victim of a bad childhood.
381	0	a	It turns out that comb-overs, cleavage, cocaine and kookiness are an unbeatable combo.
382	4	a	featherweight farce, performed agreeably
383	0	a	Keep your eye on Sam Rockwell as Harrelson's nastiest deputy. You'll think you've seen him do this before, but trust me: he's a goddamn revelation.
384	5	a	Tish's original plan to stay in her hotel room and watch TV alone with a glass of wine isn't the worst idea I've heard.
385	3	a	Farfetched plotting nearly capsizes this globe-trotting thriller but director Doug Liman certainly keeps the international intrigue and testosterone flowing at an entertaining clip.
386	5	a	Wooden is a polite word to describe the acting that goes on in Slugs.
387	2	a	Scenes take twice as long as they should, but we do learn how 'triangulated' people make romantic choices.
388	0	a	Veber's career-best outing.
389	2	a	Written and directed by Pavan Moondi, this is, unfortunately, an unfocused mess of a story, albeit one with two tremendous leads, beautiful cinematography, and some genuinely laugh out loud moments. And if you're a fan of Tim Heidecker, he kills it.
390	3	a	"The Rider"" could be, if I did not know better, an honest documentary about the life of a rodeo rider."
391	0	a	A great and troubling masterpiece, a film of such simultaneous depth and crudeness that it has elicited some of the most conflicting responses of his or any other filmmaker's career.
392	5	a	How does she do it? Simple. She doesn't. And neither does this movie.
393	3	a	So much here is rich and touching, not to mention the string of superb performances, that the film still merits a recommendation.
394	9	a	A comic franchise that has stayed loosely in tune with reality now goes screeching off into nonsense, with no good jokes to show for it.
395	4	a	The film is interesting, sexy and at times silly.
396	1	a	A nearly perfect combination of superb acting, brilliantly sweet screenwriting and a director at the top of his game.
397	2	a	Having successfully pulled off three Danny Ocean cons, director Steven Soderbergh is looking for a new bank vault to plunder. Logan Lucky turns out to be a playfully subversive variation on the theme.
398	2	a	This is a premise suited for sitcoms and a cast primed for improvisation, yet the movie never slips into either feel, keeping it bluntly real about sex and sticking to a briskly written script. 
399	0	a	A consummate work in Eastwood's filmography.
400	9	a	Murder and mayhem of this sort quickly becomes monotonous.
401	3	a	What the new Alfie turns out be all about is Jude Law, perfectly cast in the role played by Caine.
402	4	a	Despite its flaws, FIRST MEN IN THE MOON remains a charming entertainment that stirs our Sense of Wonder with its fantastic imagery...
403	6	a	...the overstuffed narrative contributes heavily to the movie's eventual downfall...
404	5	a	Unsuccessfully mixes melodrama with action/adventure and satire.
405	2	a	This story is more original than Avatar, but lacks Avatar's elegance.
406	4	a	One way Gia Coppola deals with privileges is by recognizing and revealing their limits.
407	6	a	One of those obnoxious wisecracking buddy cop movies about dimwit cops that fails to be funny.
408	5	a	Should never have come back.
409	4	a	An Unexpected Journey may as well be The Phantom Menace and God help us all if the next two movies aren't better than this one.
410	6	a	These people are so passive and joyless that we're not concerned about whether watching the tape will kill them: they all seem dead already.
411	5	a	Shockingly, talented performers such as Eckhart and the usually reliable character actor Nighy singed on the dotted line for this fetid fishbowl of a frightfest that seems as inconsequential as a pair of Frankenstein's high-water pants.
412	1	a	The Great Beauty will become one of those movies that will be discussed over and over again in future college courses.
413	4	a	A entertaining story full of jokes and funny moments. [Full review in Spanish]
414	4	a	Life, though funny and sometimes charming, doesn't give Lanie a believable context in which to stop and smell the roses.
415	3	a	A bizarrely still, tortured caper, the feature offers exceptional performances and a coarse script, yet attention always manages to return to its visual impression, calling up the decade in the strangest ways. 
416	1	a	Theron's transformation into serial killer Aileen Wuornos is so remarkably convincing, you almost forget you're watching an actress playing a part in a movie.
417	9	a	The Lazarus Effect merely coasts by on a very thin script that is really just a placeholder to get to what is obviously its larger purpose: to frighten the audience so much that we forget that we're watching a bad movie.
418	9	a	The ideas that Jason X conveys are almost too familiar to even deserve a writing credit...
419	5	a	One wonders whether American Dreamz is attempting to satirize pop culture or merely recreating it.
420	5	a	A bawdy Restoration romp that doesn't. Romp.
421	5	a	While it may score some points as an extended in-joke, the mix of juvenile comedy and insider asides is arcane, snobby and just not very funny.
422	2	a	This isn't a history lesson. It's pure entertainment, an excuse for good actors to romp through a twisting, well-told tale.
423	3	a	Serenity flies with sass and spirit, qualities that have been in palpably short supply in that Star Wars series since, well, Star Wars.
424	0	a	[Cage is] hilarious, scary, contorted, mournful, mean and weirdly, monstrously lovable -- the perfect actor to work with one of the world's most stubborn, bold, idiosyncratic filmmakers.
425	2	a	The music is, of course, great. But the real strength of Cadillac Records is found in the stories behind it.
426	4	a	Botched sensitivity aside, The Expendables delivers epic action.
427	4	a	The good feeling of reuniting with old friends is too powerful here.
428	5	a	With a narrative as flat and barren as the red martian landscape, John Carter is a big-budget sci-fi spectacle that fails to excite or entertain.
429	6	a	I laughed harder watching Norbit.
430	3	a	Whether it represents filmmaking at its most opportunistic or most empathic will be up to each viewer to decide, but there's no denying its potency as a harrowing thrill ride.
431	3	a	The affection in Burton's telling of this tale is infectious, and makes one wish more talented contemporary filmmakers were as relentlessly individual.
432	5	a	Zero gravity.
433	3	a	Land is pure entertainment and superbly well done.
434	1	a	"Like most biopics, ""Get On Up"" is flawed, but once Boseman takes the stage, his re-creation ... makes you forget the little that is wrong with the film and just concentrate on enjoying the spectacle."
435	0	a	Sizzling dialogue, incendiary performances.
436	5	a	Political comedy morphs into attempted thriller in this confused, fitfully entertaining film.
437	3	a	A smart, smooth technological thriller.
438	3	a	While this film is a brilliant, dispassionate rival to the also-brilliant Swedish original, the films that could really use the Fincher treatment are the two sequels.
439	3	a	Their chemistry together is superb. The moving, well-judged, wonderfully acted film has humour, compassion, tenderness, kindness and sadness that is even more moving because it all basically happened. 
440	0	a	Right away this film grabs attention with documentary-style close- ups and upends teen movie cliches.
441	0	a	The moving film may be arduous to watch, but brilliantly acting and painstaking accuracy make it a must-see.
442	3	a	Bright Days Ahead is a fitting title for a story about one woman's transition at a turning point of her life where time is no longer her enemy, but her anchor.
443	4	a	Lacks dramatic punch and depth.
444	5	a	Levinson has written and directed in many genres. But rarely has he made a film as indecisive and diffident as Man of the Year.
445	2	a	A novel and surprisingly wry helping of big-screen comic-book life.
446	3	a	Campion manages to understand and present the essence of a passionate relationship, without becoming corny or old fashioned. [Full review in Spanish]
447	3	a	Cultural clashes all over the place in this sweet and gently comedy.
448	4	a	The Light Between Oceans sucks you in with the beauty of its landscapes, the elegance of its period detail, and the chemistry between two blindingly attractive stars who might actually be in love.
449	5	a	For a film about love, Bright Star is curiously cold, more pretty than emotional. True stars have heat.
450	5	a	Red Planet lacks the one thing even a C-grade sci-fi writer could provide: a good yarn.
451	3	a	What's most surprising is how endearing it all is - it's just so dang likeable, for any age group, grown-ups included, and exudes appeal from the get go. Feelgood is the word and one of the best teen movies Hollywood's made in years.
452	5	a	We wanted characters that don't require a narrator to explain who they are. We wanted lofty pontification about bushido
453	6	a	... started off incredibly strong and petered out to a predictable and dull ending. Not great, not awful, it's certainly a disappointment.
454	3	a	Pretty good sequel, among several that followed, this time directed by Stallone.
455	6	a	[T]he basic skeleton of the story is at obvious odds with itself and not all of the charismatic actors in the world will keep the outcome from feeling like it lasts forever.
456	3	a	The plot is clever and a bit unconventional. Bradley Cooper, Jennifer Lawrence and Robert De Niro all turn in wonderful performances in this very funny, very warm comedy.
457	1	a	[Kaurismaki's] a humanist bearing witness to the human parade. To be part of that parade is to be touched by his perspective, and to have your world altered -- magically, fleetingly, memorably.
458	1	a	Instead of being a slow, dull historical drama, it is actually an exciting action drama.
459	3	a	When the film features a steel cage brawl between Li and a gaggle of Ultimate Fighting Champions, an ATV chase with DMX, and a kick-ass girlfight between Kelly Hu and Gabrielle Union, enduring the dreck is a relatively small price to pay.
460	8	a	Its unholy mixture of peppy sadism and pious, self-righteous sentiment comes straight from Hughes' crabbed cinematic heart.
461	6	a	Outside of demonstrating Wuornos' ignorance and apparent mental illness, I'm not sure what Jenkins' point is or what Theron is trying to convey about the film's protagonist.
462	2	a	A terminal illness movie that doesn't beat you over the head with overwrought sentimentality
463	4	a	Lately, Hollywood has gotten so obsessed with doing big things badly, it seems to have forgotten how to do small things well.
464	5	a	But that feeling quickly disappears thanks to the movie's awfulness, and by the time it was over the only excitement I still felt was the supreme joy of finally being able to leave the theatre and head back home.
465	3	a	Bright Star shines brightly indeed, not only on the strength of a couple of powerhouse performances, but also as a look back at a time when poets were rock stars, with all the skinny British attitude that implies.
466	3	a	Waist Deep is what used to be called a B movie, back in the days when there were double features... It's a hard little melodrama, done well.
467	3	a	If you're watching for perfectly matched action you're not into the mystery and you probably aren't going to be very sympathetic to the effort involved.
468	4	a	It's just hard to tell exactly what the point is after a while, at least beyond getting the kids in attendance to cheer and laugh with recognition.
469	5	a	Rather than touching and meaningful, it just comes off as dour and pedantic.
470	7	a	Only a frolicking duet set to Bobby Brown breaks the monotony.
471	8	a	It's a fanboy 'what if?' brought to life on the big screen.
472	4	a	It's a bit too muddy, dismal-looking and smoky to beguile us, too fixated on filth and too dreary-looking to really shock us.
473	9	a	Stale reheat of the creepy kid genre. No point investigating. Case closed.
474	1	a	Landau's Lugosi is an alternately amusing and heartbreaking character who is given one last taste of life while in orbit around Wood's infectious mania
475	3	a	It's a love story, yes, but one whose sweetness is cut by honest performances, a sharply drawn supporting cast and a fairly serious, yet never self-pitying, tone.
476	3	a	A faithful adaptation of the Thomas Pynchon novel that feels as if a labyrinthine Raymond Chandler thriller has been thrown into a cocktail shaker with Alice In Wonderland.
477	3	a	There's something reassuring about how little Sick Boy, Begbie, Spud and Renton have learned about life in the past two decades.
478	2	a	"While Jackson hasn't delivered a hit on par with his ""Lord of the Rings"" movies, ""The Hobbit"" proves he can still do justice to the tricky blend of fantasy and action that made the earlier entries such enjoyable works of popular entertainment."
479	6	a	...if you're jonesing for some violence, this'll have to do.
480	4	a	It's far from perfect, but it's not a bad stab at tricky material.
481	9	a	Talented actors McGregor, Watts and Gosling are wasted in a pretentious thriller that's located in a space between reality and illusion, life and death, in other words limbo.
482	7	a	A soggy adventure best suited to DVD-rental desperation.
483	3	a	Infectiously dotty.
484	7	a	fails as an espionage thriller, but also as a romance
485	0	a	[A] gloriously romantic, sumptuous movie ...
486	6	a	Explains Austen's art simply and neatly: too simply, in fact, to do justice to such a brilliant observer of social manners and hypocrisies and weaver of complex, romantic moral tales.
487	1	a	What is perhaps most amazing is that a film this terrifying, violent and relentlessly nihilistic should also be this enthralling.
488	5	a	A bleached-out dreariness and lethargic pace drains this challenging film of much of its impact.
489	1	a	There's nothing ambiguous about the strength of Hawke's work or the fact that this is a complete artistic comeback for a writer and director who has always refused easy answers.
490	5	a	Watching this picture is akin to two hours of being beaten over the head with a rubber chicken peppered with razor blades, and by the time it was over my head hurt so bad it would have taken a whole bottle of aspirin to make it go away.
491	4	a	Marsh is too content framing the entire film around the narrative spun by its subjects, rather than stamping his own authorship on the film, and as a result it lacks the power and depth of his previous work.
492	3	a	This is a journey designed to leave you saturated with rawboned terror and despair. It wants us to consider our values in this world and contemplate what might follow. In that harsh mission, it is powerfully effective.
493	3	a	A great film from an American master.
494	6	a	The sequels got progressively sillier, but the body counts are still fun to tally.
495	3	a	'Lots of exciting action sequences, a charismatic hero, a few chuckles here and there and some top-drawer special effects work. The only thing it lacks is Isaac Asimov.
496	3	a	Cahill's second feature film is another smart, inventive and engaging offering.
497	3	a	A landmark motion picture.
498	5	a	If they were going to show how he got to be the brilliant, charming, exquisitely cultured, uh, vicious cannibal psychopath -- couldn't they have come up with something more interesting?
499	4	a	To the film's credit, no one finds the age gap that scandalous, but that doesn't mean it doesn't matter. These are people at very different places in life.
500	5	a	This journey is one bumpy ride.
501	5	a	when you have a serial killer story, by avoiding this subject matter completely, you tend to soften the film
502	5	a	fails to satisfy on any emotional or intellectual level.
503	10	a	[Director] Cianfrance has one chance to lighten the load, to unleash a little visual magic to boost the narrative contrivance, and all he can summon are handheld shots of crashing foam.
504	1	a	The magnificent, passionate music alone makes it worth watching. The layered story and complex, deeply wounded characters make it worth revisiting again and again.
505	9	a	Stuff that goes on in this movie is illegal nowadays.
506	2	a	This appealing romantic comedy catapulted the ever-likeable sandra Bullock into major stardom
507	7	a	a Tyler Perry movie without the Tyler Perry
508	6	a	Jonah Hex would hate this movie. He would make fun of this movie.
509	3	a	Magnificent performances and soul-shaking music make up for some narrative stumbles and dubious fictions in this film about the legendary Chicago record label.
510	4	a	Robinson is an immensely engaging lead, and Simon's tricky predicament, while rendered rather simplistically at times, rings true.
511	5	a	Akin to a thrift shop novelty that is way past its prime.
512	3	a	Enhancing the film with special effects and a clearer presentation, Lucas has turned something that was relatively unwatchable into something that can endure as a sci-fi classic.
513	2	a	The lack of screenwriting imagination is offset by the inherent charm of the picture, resulting in a pleasing arrangement of CG-animated action set-pieces and slapstick comedy to push Bolt beyond the repetitive family film norm.
514	5	a	It has the gumption to open a huge ethical can of worms without the first idea what to do with them.
515	4	a	Hathaway and McAvoy are appealing, but bland. The scenes that hark back to Pride and Prejudice are not so much evocative as hackneyed. It is all very pleasant, but it is also a bit of a bore.
516	5	a	The Angry Birds Movie is a lot of things, but none of them true to the app's appeal.
517	9	a	Although Freeman was born to play Mandela, this is not the Mandela he deserves.
518	3	a	Rollicking, soap-like tale of women's love lives.
519	5	a	If Bartkowiak can't make a good film, he should at least let his inner Ed Wood out to play more often.
520	3	a	Shlocky and ridiculous it may be, but this horror-thriller really is gleefully gruesome and undeniably entertaining: smart work from German director Christian Alvert.
521	5	a	These guys just aren't interesting. Their jobs just aren't interesting. And the film just isn't interesting.
522	4	a	A sweetly good-natured fable, with winning voice performances by Disney veteran Jim Cummings in the dual roles of Pooh and Tigger, and especially by Brad Garrett as the perpetually gloomy Eeyore.
523	3	a	The cinema-awareness of CQ is such that it looks as if it was made by and for someone who has seen every movie imaginable but hasn't lived yet.
524	2	a	It may not win over diehard Disney haters, and it doesn't qualify as great filmmaking, but I bet kids will be enjoying this one for decades to come.
525	9	a	You'd think the idea of a satire that combined politics and pop culture would be rife with possibility, but Weitz is more timid in the box than Jon Heder in The Benchwarmers.
526	5	a	Considering how great it looks, it's a shame the odd choices Almodovar makes in telling the story turn it into one of his first big misses in a long time.
527	4	a	Eastwood, returning to race as a theme, has made a timely film about a nation of many races rallying around a leader who understands symbolism.
528	4	a	Though tonally uneven, Hornet nonetheless works as breezy, irreverent entertainment that makes a virtue of its unlikely elements.
529	6	a	The problem with the film, mostly, is that it's overstuffed with historical incidents that don't really cohere into a convincing story beyond the usual rise-fall-rebirth stuff.
530	0	a	A film for those that rarely go to the movies 'because they don't make movies like they used to.' Well, apparently they do...
531	4	a	Chances are nothing like this happened at all, but imagining that it did turns out to be quite a lot of fun.
532	3	a	An intelligent, extraordinary period drama, transported by the transcendent power of song.
533	7	a	Manages to mix philosophy, history, hysteria and a love triangle and still be something of a bore.
534	4	a	Highly recommendable, especially for fans of Firefly.
535	7	a	There's nothing going on beneath the artful surface, and the kid's dilemma generates yawns instead of heat.
536	3	a	You will believe a chicken has teeth.
537	3	a	Director Marc Forster makes the film much more cinematic than anticipated which results in an artistic interpretation of our childhood memories.
538	4	a	One of those well-made movies that can't find the elusive element that turns a lukewarm thriller into a scorcher.
539	3	a	Hereafter is quintessential Eastwood, marked by the classic style, level of intimacy and general flair for storytelling that has defined the best of his career.
540	4	a	It's more than a little frustrating to be so stimulated visually while being spoon-fed incongruous spiritual mumbo jumbo and force-fed incompatible summer action conventions.
541	6	a	Are these righteous breasts, or breasts of righteousness? Can they really be both at once? 
542	2	a	Nothing more than a zombie movie, but it's a first-class zombie movie, good, ghoulish fun, staged with skill and a nicely twisted sense of humor.
543	6	a	In the end, I think this film would've worked better with B-list actors and a director who fully embraced the melodrama. As it is, The Light Between Oceans feels like a film between genres.
544	3	a	A strange but mostly satisfying hybrid of WWII actioner and anti-war satire... [Blu-ray]
545	3	a	If you can get past the psychological density of the source material and the tabloid noise around the star , this mesmerizing mind-bender ought to prove that Robert Pattinson really can act and Director David Cronenberg never runs from a challenge.
546	6	a	The film's ugliness is less in its 'artful' death rituals, by now deeply generic, than in asking us to feel for Lecter because of his horrid, warping youth.
547	4	a	While not quite Crowe at his absolute best, it carries his humanistic imprint and benefits from a strong acting ensemble that keep emotions in check.
548	5	a	This one, in every sense, is fake.
549	2	a	Contrived, but beautifully cast and very entertaining.
550	4	a	For most of Not Easily Broken, I wondered why the movie wasn't worse. Then I remembered it was directed by the veteran Bill Duke, who applies ample TLC.
551	6	a	I firmly believe that a good video game movie is going to show up soon. I also believe that Resident Evil is not it.
552	7	a	It's one bland scene after another, played at medium pace with middling creativity, punctuated with a near-desperate attempt at a laugh
553	5	a	Trash with a whiplash.
554	6	a	The silly fun and the rudimentary personal reflection come off as equally superficial, and end up equally forgettable.
555	3	a	Agora, Alejandro Amenabar's absorbing historical drama, proves that, in an era of movies made for iPhones with artistic ambitions to match, there are still filmmakers willing to swing for the fences.
556	3	a	Retaining the swashbuckling spirit of Stevenson's novel but adding megabytes of computer-age cool, Treasure Planet is the one holiday thrill ride the whole family can enjoy.
557	3	a	[Hello, My Name is Doris] helps us to appreciate the kind of beauty that doesn't fade away. 
558	3	a	A children's movie with enough gumption, fire and wit to warm the cockles of an adult heart.
559	5	a	Exhibits no trace of the random, goofy humor found in Leiner's first two directorial efforts.
560	4	a	The end result is less than the sum of its parts, a smoke 'n' mirrors melodrama that peters out just when it should be revving into high gear.
561	6	a	While this remake does have a certain charm, it's also fundamentally, fatally flawed.
562	4	a	Incredibly well made and heroically performed. It also really delivers when it comes to creating a strange alien world.
563	3	a	James Franco's collection of autobiographical short stories is adapted into a remarkably evocative film by Gia Coppola, granddaughter of Francis. 
564	3	a	The Bourne Identity does not have much in the way of plot or characters, but it is a better-than-average guns, gadgets, and chases in interesting locations movie.
565	3	a	A family-friendly rallying cry against conformity, far more daring than the tastelessness that passes for daring in Team America, but undercut by excessive length. 
566	3	a	A little dated and a little immature when compared to later Miyazaki works, but that's not such a bad thing, really.
567	1	a	This is a B-movie, albeit a largish budget B-movie, but with an undeniable B-movie spirit.
568	5	a	The biggest problem I had with this film was the set-up and premise. It works on paper, but most of the movie is spent with the characters being simply awful.
569	3	a	The controversy surrounding it continues to be much ado about nothing. It's a terrific follow-up to the incomparable original... no matter whose name is on the credits.
570	5	a	Family comedies about Martians don't need to be plausible exactly, but they need to be smart and entertaining. This one is ho-hum, so-so and so what?
571	0	a	Certainly among the top five of all Bonds, and still socko.
572	5	a	Zain Al Rafeea's naturalness, however uncanny, only makes the film's maneuverings seem all the more obvious.
573	3	a	Only the faint-hearted or KFC kitchen staff should give it a miss. 
574	4	a	Despite the craft and committed performances, Bleed For This feels very conventional and never delivers a knockout blow.
575	3	a	Just as Hicks did for the keyboard, Gorris makes the chessboard sexy, mostly by focusing not on it but on the people sitting at it.
576	7	a	A pooped, poorly executed buddy-cop comedy with more cliches than expletives.
577	3	a	Though its morality may be controversial, the film, an impressive debut from Boaz Yakin, deserves credit for introducing a new type of protagonist, a ghetto teenager willing to do everything and anything to escape his lot.
578	0	a	A powerful examination of one of the key moments of the Civil Rights movement and the man who sacrificed made it possible.
579	3	a	A zany comedy that makes FBI agents look like keystone cops.
580	0	a	[Martin McDonagh] brings that same keen eye and razor-fine writing to his American cousins in Ebbing, Missouri. He treats them with a similar cruel but deep affection.
581	0	a	A valentine to the glories of silent cinema, a triumph of artistic teleportation, pure effervescence that gives crowdpleasing a good name.
582	4	a	It does have a predictable trajectory -- how could it not? -- but it's certainly not movie-of-the-week fare.
583	3	a	An elegant, existentially enigmatic meditation on opulence and decadence.
584	2	a	The 'LOTR' films have become so iconic and undeniably definitive, that it's often anticlimactic in 'The Hobbit' to hear grand characters saying new sentences in new settings. 
585	5	a	How can studios pour millions of dollars and masses of talent into that a project that inspires such apathy?
586	4	a	The film's expected rehash of recent pop-culture totems is accompanied by a novel attention to millennial-centric debates about entitlement and identity politics.
587	3	a	"Jonathan Swift said: ""Satire is a sort of glass, wherein beholders do generally discover everybody's face but their own."" Trey Parker are Matt Stone are fiendish satirists."
588	1	a	Unfolds like a novel full of characters we can't help but care about.
589	6	a	A mealy conglomeration of high-school-sports movies, teacher-who-motivates-students movies, and inner-city-kids-have-a-tough-life movies.
590	5	a	It's rude and raunchy, and it has a message -- sort of. You have to wade through an awful lot of obscenity to get to it, though.
591	0	a	Verhoeven keeps the whole thing chugging along neatly with a huge dollop of ultra-violence and gore. Schwarzenegger is at his best ever.
592	2	a	...stirring action, good performances, and a plethora of visual delights.
593	4	a	On the whole, this is another disappointing animated effort and it resides considerably lower on the totem pole than this year's current non-live action champion, Ratatouille.
594	3	a	A vibrant refashioning of gothic romance and blood-soaked horror that injects fresh energy into old-fashioned tropes.
595	5	a	The political intrigue subplot feels tacked on and dull, the film is entirely too long for a simple revenge melodrama...and the structure mercilessly follows its predictable pattern...
596	8	a	"Enduring ""The Tourist"" is like going for a ride in a sinking gondola."
597	7	a	You might have been able to get away with stuff like this in the pre-Pixar age. Not anymore.
598	3	a	It's up to us to decide Kennedy's guilt. But, also, to sympathize with his shame.
599	2	a	Maybe someday there will be a better commercial comedy about a girl taking charge of her sexual education, but for now, this is the only one we've got, and it's a filthy-fun charmer.
600	4	a	Hoffman's direction is a mixture of skill and showiness. He's attentive to all the actors, but he can't resist cute camera angles and Fellini-esque touches that don't quite fit this story.
601	3	a	Deeply pleasing in a connect-the-literary-dots manner.
602	0	a	A treasure trove of outstanding performances, brilliant writing and heartfelt direction.
603	3	a	Eastwood's latest is serenely, even masterfully eccentric -- the sort of movie that begins with a tsunami and ends with a kiss.
604	4	a	We're more in like with Huckabees, than in love.
605	6	a	The movie shoots itself in the foot with a gimmicky ending.
606	2	a	Great action and witty sight gags raise the toon bar.
607	6	a	Flight of the Phoenix is not only reductive but irrelevant too.
608	3	a	Well-paced, nicely shot, and smart enough to give each member of the ensemble a few moments to shine.
609	6	a	A serviceable adventure outing.
610	1	a	It's a slow burn at times, but in the end, it's as satisfying as a good cup of, well, you know what.
611	6	a	The movie's problem is that it's a cartoon, offering no emotional involvement with its characters and no dramatic imperative.
612	3	a	American Dreamz is a political satire that's eerily emblematic of the moment we're living in: smart, spring-loaded with pop culture references, and far too good-natured to do any lasting damage.
613	0	a	The notion of art as a 'religious experience' is sometimes bandied about too freely. Tarkovsky is one of a handful of filmmakers for whom this ideal was no cheap metaphor.
614	5	a	The heart-tugging, done with enough torque to uproot tree stumps, even pulls in the movie's two best actors, [Ed] Harris and the semi-retired Debra Winger.
615	0	a	The cinematic equivalent of a Homeric epic...an ambitious, mesmerizing evocation of the mystique of celebrity and the strange mixture of admiration and envy it generates.
616	6	a	Lovely to look at, perhaps, but in the end there's not much to it behind the surface glamour.
617	2	a	Awe-inspiring, travelogue-like trek through hostile, challenging landscapes, it's a spectacular slog.
618	5	a	Many scenes trigger memories of Monty Python and the Holy Grail, prompting laughter where there should be suspense and angst.
619	2	a	The pleasure of watching the movie is derived from the nuanced performances of both Sharif and newcomer Boulanger.
620	1	a	"Jurassic Park"" remains an absolute thrill from a Spielberg in top form: Funny, scary, fast-moving and full of just-right details."
621	4	a	No great passion is being conjured up on screen, just an exhausted sense of relief that things might not be as bad as all that. Which is what you might say for the film as a whole after all its troubles.
622	4	a	Melanie Griffith looks hot in that dark wig; too bad she ditches it so quickly.
623	4	a	Stylish but shallow melodrama, based on McMillan's best-seller.
624	2	a	Jarmusch's original film, which deconstructs the mobster genre as seen through the eyes of a Samurai, is by turn eccentric, mysterious, and mythical, defying viewers expectations
625	3	a	These are lovely characters, it's a witty script, there's lots of laughs.
626	3	a	Friends With Kids is the story of two best friends who discuss having a child together even though they are not a couple.
627	4	a	Overall, a little bit slower and unspectacular than contemporary family films, but a little more memorable.
628	1	a	Ethan Hawke hauntingly embodies Reverend Toller, a middle-aged pastor at a church whose glory days are long past.
629	6	a	The movie is still one tacky sight.
630	2	a	It's good enough that I might just start taking an interest in the books after all.
631	3	a	...A movie that has consistently entertained audiences on the festival circuit since its premiere at Tribeca in April.
632	2	a	"The thing is silly as hell and having Kim Jong Il sound like Eric Cartman from ""South Park"" is a stroke of genius. This is a very funny film and should be seen forthwith."
633	3	a	This movie is just too much fun not to like.
634	6	a	It's up to Rockwell and Lohman to play slices of white bread in this ham sandwich of a movie.
635	4	a	The adaptation of this coming-of-age tale is stylishly brought to the screen, even if it feels a bit light on substance.
636	3	a	Chappaquiddick is a powerful cautionary tale, and a reminder that people will forgive and forget anything if the surrounding news cycle is loud enough.
637	5	a	"Like Taylor Swift's pop hit ""Love Story,"" Garry Winick's Letters to Juliet references Shakespeare to prop up its cornball fairy-tale romanticism."
638	3	a	This sharply original horror film not only approaches its premise from an unexpected angle, but it creates characters who add a psychological depth that makes the film far more involving than expected.
639	5	a	Undemanding tykes will gets their giggles flowing with the Rube Goldberg-style contraptions invented for the dogs.
640	5	a	I was never bored, and the period detail is lovingly observed; but there is a sense of an opportunity missed.
641	6	a	It is just bland and easily forgettable.
642	1	a	Some may find it sour and even repulsive, with its pathological anarchy of flavours. Some will find it delicious, in a deliriously exotic manner. Count me in the second camp.
643	9	a	So bad that it's borderline fascinating.
644	5	a	Reign of Fire never comes close to recovering from its demented premise, but it does sustain an enjoyable level of ridiculousness.
645	3	a	American Violet is a fine film. Dee Roberts is not an abstract symbol of injustice. To watch a mother be wrenched away from her children is heartrending.
646	1	a	We are uncomfortably reminded throughout the film that all living creatures have worth. Including man-made hybrids. Correction: especially man-made hybrids.
647	4	a	I still don't understand how J.K. Rowling could have made such obscene gobs of cash off of such a simple and overwrought premise ... I'll stick with LORD OF THE RINGS
648	6	a	It's also likely that Roth just hasn't been able to dial down his usual routine far enough for a family audience. Given the charm of the film's first act, that really seems too bad.
649	4	a	It's a story that loses momentum, the narrative lurching unsteadily towards the denouement in a story that perfectly illustrates that looks aren't everything.
650	3	a	"Delightful, dense and sweetly disarming, ""Ralph Breaks the Internet"" works, as the best Disney animated films do, on several levels, meaning parents can enjoy it as much as the kids. "
651	3	a	Through all this, there remains that calm center of nasty, brilliant social insight.
652	2	a	What I expected to be a big fat mess of a movie turned out to be pretty dang fun -- quadruply so if you happen to be a Star Wars fanatic.
653	6	a	The movie is never a chore to watch, but its characters feel like microbes under glass: tiny, remote and insignificant.
654	3	a	...a savvy, shrewd commentary on the listless self-absorption of modern computer cocooners.
655	3	a	Xavier, the movie's center, is unfortunately one of the less interesting people in L'Auberge Espagnole, but the lovable chaos that swirls about him makes up for that.
656	4	a	Like a lot of Hollywood filler, Welcome Home Roscoe Jenkins' mandate seems to be to entertain and satisfy as many people as possible by sticking to a tested and proven formula, the result of which is it does neither particularly well.
657	5	a	At least it's relatively short.
658	5	a	Even comic geniuses are allowed an off-day -- or off-movie, as the case may be -- and Mel Brooks strikes out with this sizable flop.
659	4	a	Like Romero's Day of the Dead, it's the weakest of the three films. Unlike Romero's film, it doesn't have quite as much going for it, despite some fairly decent gore.
660	3	a	The way Matt's fate plays out is consistently engaging, at once clever and insightful.
661	3	a	A crowd-pleasing blue-collar comedy, half funny and half sad.
662	3	a	A model of politically engaged cinema, offering a clear-eyed view of a social problem without pretending to have any easy solutions.
663	4	a	A film teetering on the edge of importance.
664	1	a	I, Robot is the best kind of adventure movie, one that engages your heart, your sense of humor and your ache for a good yarn.
665	9	a	Panders to its audience instead of challenging the sensitive juggling act that working mothers face every day. This picture is not insight, it's a display of insipid wish fulfillment. 
666	6	a	Characters as out of touch and desperate as Albert Nobbs awaken an instinctive doubt and distrust in an audience.
667	3	a	This film is dark as night but great fun, taking teen issues by the scruff of the neck and holding them up as the rather unpleasant exhibits they are.
668	3	a	This is one of the more creative, unusually entertaining things I've seen in a while.
669	3	a	A fine movie but not the masterpiece you've heard.
670	8	a	There's room left open, of course, for the eagerly-awaited conclusion to the Parent Focker trilogy. Here's hoping that when that blessed day arrives, I'll be good and dead.
671	3	a	This movie is dangerous.
672	1	a	Reminds us why murder mysteries and investigative procedurals -- useful parables about the certainty of death that have pretty much migrated to television -- can be especially compelling in a darkened theater.
673	6	a	I did say almost. As comedies and sequels go, this one still isn't any good. The writing by screenwriter Sam Harper is astonishingly limp, going to places even a bad NBC sitcom would be afraid to tread.
674	6	a	After the premise settles in the dust just as it should, the movie crumbles into one big mess where the characters spurt out some incredibly dumb dialogue and act like they are in some sort of Spice Girls music video.
675	4	a	The film's heart is found not with the two leads but in a gut-wrenching monologue by Michael Stuhlburg as Elio's father.
676	3	a	...has more personality than anyone should rightly expect from a two-hour-plus, CGI-heavy, sci-fi fantasy epic.
677	2	a	From the high-concept title to the family-friendly story line, it's basically a Tim Allen movie, only made with taste and feeling.
678	5	a	Great work by Dern, but I don't understand the director's need to denigrate Midwestern and/or lower-class people, and depict them as a tribe of slack-jawed morons.
679	4	a	The film knows the aesthetic of enlightenment, the filmmakers demonstrate adoration for their subject, but whether or not the film grasps the principle further is very arguable.
680	2	a	A flirty and autobiographical road movie by the Coppola matriarch. [Full review in Spanish]
681	1	a	Rarely has a film so funny, chilling and revealing as American Psycho graced the silver screen.
682	3	a	Although he is working in an older acting style that favors large gestures and emphatic facial expressions, Dujardin still evokes the entire wealth of the emotional spectrum
683	0	a	A magnificent film, vital and alive, with the most profound sense of immediacy I think I've ever felt in a historical story.
684	5	a	A fantastic bore.
685	9	a	Much time is spent waiting for a methane-filled toilet to explode, an incident that only begins to approximate the visceral experience of watching this movie.
686	1	a	great flick from spielberg
687	1	a	A fascinatingly complex film with intoxicating cross-currents of cynicism, tragedy, and absurdity.
688	1	a	So unique and memorable that it sits alongside classic first features like Sexy Beast, Reservoir Dogs and Shallow Grave
689	5	a	The inherent limitations of using a video game as the source material movie are once again made all too clear in this schlocky horror/action hybrid.
690	5	a	Director Peyton Reed really does seem to be trying to probe for something more worthy, to find some insight into modern-day relationships, but it simply isn't there.
691	0	a	Yes, it's virtually silent, it's black-and-white, and you might not know the leads. But if you don't take a chance on this film, we can't be friends any more.
692	4	a	There's something Jerry Springeresque about Gladiator.
693	3	a	It's a cycle of deranged depravity all done in the name of God, Gods and Goddesses, everyone certain in their beliefs and just as certain in their right to show no mercy to those who do not believe the same.
694	2	a	Just when you think this surreal world can't surprise you any longer, it comes up with something else that may make you gasp or wince but will most likely make you laugh. 
695	7	a	Terribly lame humour don't help.
696	4	a	Pretension is kept at bay by the fact that whenever someone is holding court, the others in the scene barely seem to be listening.
697	3	a	Macabre and astonishing.
698	6	a	This fictionalized story is a thin disguise for David Bowie's bio, and it is a rip-off of the Citizen Kane way of telling a fictionalized biography.
699	2	a	Whiskey Tango Foxtrot still shows Fey's hilarious side, but it's a satirical take on life as a war correspondent and requires Fey to move through gears from serious to funny and absurd.
700	6	a	While still not a grand work of art, Meet the Spartans improves upon the formula established in the earlier parodies of Friedberg and Seltzer.
701	6	a	As an ode to fading small towns, and to the state its director once called home, it feels downright disingenuous.
702	4	a	Despite the clashing comedic styles, a game cast ... finds a few nuggets of truth and warmth, and several full-tilt belly laughs.
703	4	a	It certainly looks stunning, and there's even a try at injecting some human drama and strong emotion into the action stew.
704	4	a	Only a grown man who has retained his boyish charm could look believable on this surreal quest to reconnect with his childhood soft toys. Ewan McGregor carries it off admirably...
705	5	a	Rather than his usual intensity, economy of style and a no-nonsense depiction of strong characters, Eastwood's film is akin to a lumbering rugby player pounding the same ground over and over again.
706	3	a	If you don't already know where it ends up then I assure you that you have no idea where it's going to end up.
707	3	a	Part of the appeal of this comedy is that Melvin's transformation never gets sappy.
708	0	a	Triumphantly fierce, funny, moving and innovative.
709	3	a	Funny, but not a light comedy for youngsters.
710	4	a	There is still plenty to enjoy in the antics of these multigenerational goofballs. The premise is already running out of steam, though, so it's probably time to move on.
711	1	a	A very absorbing film.
712	1	a	Brody's performance as Jack is about as good as that which won him the Oscar for The Pianist.
713	2	a	"While it is a little over-simplified in the end - which, to be fair, might have been necessary to get it made - ""Black or White"" is a thoughtful addition to the current dialogue on race relations."
714	3	a	Christopher Robin suffers from occasionally languid pacing, but it's a truly worthy summer entry for families.
715	1	a	American Hustle is an extremely entertaining ride through the human condition, with characters just short of ridiculous. The beautiful thing is that Russell does this without becoming mean.
716	1	a	War of the Worlds is that most rare of screen adaptations - a film that is faithful to its origins and at the same time, its own separate creature. The first half is better than the second, but what a first half.
717	4	a	Eat Pray Love isn't a bad movie -- just a spiritually dead one, wearing and wearying.
718	6	a	Never delivers the big laughs this star in this promising premise really should.
719	9	a	The frequent contemptuousness the film displays toward its characters keeps the audience at arm's length.
720	5	a	The weirdness is kind of charming; everything else pretty much stinks.
721	0	a	This tale of power and revenge proves that there are still some people in the movie business who know what they're doing.
722	5	a	Dreyfuss and Hunter can't save what is a sappy and grating melodrama.
723	3	a	"Nebraska tunes its bittersweet ""personal journey"" riffs to the plaintive waltz of picked guitars and lyrical fiddles, played out against a backdrop of fading midwest towns and long, lonesome interstates."
724	3	a	Those of us whose diet includes two dozen romantic comedies a year may find Apatow's crass good nature appealing. Knocked Up has something to shock almost everyone but something to make almost everyone smile, too.
725	6	a	Stabs at the dramatic don't amount to anything that makes us care, even for Bell, who has been solid on AMC's The Walking Dead and in the chairlift chiller Frozen.
726	4	a	It's a stately, handsome-looking studio drama that, for me, never really became emotionally or intellectually involving.
727	0	a	Some of it is terrific. And some of it is spectacular.
728	5	a	Who knew that playing God would be so unfulfilling... or so dull.
729	0	a	It's streetwise stuff, shot in a vigorous on-the-hoof style, but also full of joy, both in its blissfully comic moments and in Doinel's telling passion for moviegoing.
730	3	a	Director Francois Depeyron evokes the look and feel of nostalgia extremely well, recalling films like 'Cinema Paradiso' for their wistfulness and charm.
731	6	a	A Soap Opera under the big top, The Greatest Show on Earth features little in the way of a plot and more in the line of a hollow spectacle.
732	9	a	Rob Schneider's infantile cross-dressing routines fill The Hot Chick, the latest gimmick from this unimaginative comedian.
733	1	a	Scored intensely and photographed vividly, the electric film imagines a small slice of doomsday with horrific believability.
734	4	a	What we have here is a movie that believes it is a massive and glorious heroic epic, when it's really a backlot melodrama.
735	4	a	It's long but involving, with an unexpectedly good performance from Dean Martin. 
736	4	a	"John Carter"" is certainly an interesting idea for a film, with a power struggle on an alien world and an outsider affecting the balance, but sadly it never ends up fully working."
737	4	a	The heart of the movie is dull.
738	2	a	Successfully shows another side of society that feels foreign and unfamiliar at first, but one that's infinitely more interesting when put into context of our own lives.
739	3	a	Mystic River is the rare American movie that aspires to -- and achieves -- the full weight and darkness of tragedy.
740	6	a	The cast is directed to often scream at each other at the top of their lungs, making the would-be comic material all bark with little-to-no bite.
741	9	a	To give you an idea of how completely, desperately unfunny National Security is, even Steve Zahn isn't funny.
742	4	a	It's not by any means a good movie. But Jay and Silent Bob is one heck of a good laugh.
743	3	a	A beautiful looking piece of work.
744	3	a	It's a lot of fun -- if you like to grimace, jump and squirm in the theater.
745	1	a	McConaughey's performance as the Mephistophelean title character is one for the ages.
746	4	a	[The final act is] a great half hour or so of film -- funny, charming, sad, satisfying -- but the rest of Philomena isn't so up to snuff.
747	4	a	Jones maintains a Hughesian vibe and she's armed with eager thespians, arranging a mild romp that's meant to be a valentine to moms everywhere.
748	4	a	Now and Then is successful, but only now and then.
749	5	a	Beneath this slick variation on the Sleeping Beauty theme lies a male fantasy that would not withstand much hard psychological scrutiny.
750	9	a	I'd rather eat my own liver than sit through this again
751	3	a	And get this, not one single flatulence joke to be found in the entire film. Thank you, Brad Bird. Thank you.
752	6	a	There is little suspense.
753	2	a	VALKYRIE feels like the exciting second part of a miniseries. Part one had all the character bits and drama, though.
754	1	a	If you're looking for an intense, character-driven movie, Revolutionary Road delivers big time.
755	3	a	A fine performance from Bale, but the film is definitely an acquired taste.
756	3	a	Powered by an infusion of gospel and hip-hop that cleverly bridges gaps between generations and values.
757	3	a	An animated elephant adventure with some peril.
758	2	a	The Joneses is a list of grievances nailed to the door of the Church of Materialism, but the hammer never hits the audience's fingers.
759	4	a	An OK thriller with some terrific ideas and a storyline that progresses well much of the way but lacks originality and character depth.
760	5	a	There's a brilliant movie here somewhere, but it's never quite brought out.
761	7	a	It's mindless junk like this that makes you appreciate original romantic comedies like Punch-Drunk Love.
762	2	a	By-the-numbers, but Cranston is always compelling.
763	5	a	Misfire comedy starring Dreyfuss, directed by Mazursky.
764	3	a	I'm really glad Soderbergh's back doing what he does best. I didn't know how much I missed the guy.
765	0	a	A work that is as horrifying as it is beautiful, as disturbing as it is gratifying, and as powerful as it is controversial.
766	9	a	We've never gotten the appeal of Cook, and this did nothing to explain it.
767	0	a	unabashedly sentimental and grand in its themes of goodness, honor, tenacity, and forgiveness
768	0	a	Intimate as a whisper, immediate as a blush, and universal as first love, the PG-rated film positively palpitates with the sensual and spiritual.
769	1	a	Like an Edward Hopper painting sprung to life, its mood washes over you in an evocative mix of opulence and despair as it dizzyingly dances with the forbidden. 
770	4	a	The underwritten dramatization is saved by the stunning surreal visuals.
771	0	a	Selma's achievements defy those of regular films.
772	0	a	The Artist delights in an ingeniously straightforward way that exceeds many a modern, technologically advanced, effects-loaded, big-budget blockbuster.
773	5	a	About as funny as lice.
774	5	a	The movie hurts.
775	3	a	Christian Bale delivers a whale of a performance.
776	5	a	It's a story less about the characters involved than it is about the dynamics between them, a late addition to the Symposium's accounts of the great god Love.
777	5	a	The acting feels stilted and the setup seems aimless. Too often, it feels like you're watching a stranger's holiday videos.
778	3	a	While it's certainly a sideways move after the astonishing The Master, one could argue that Anderson's earned himself the right to take a break, smoke up and giggle.
779	3	a	As of yet, we have no science on reincarnation, but the science fiction is definitely getting warmer.
780	0	a	"In many ways - in all ways - ""The Artist"" is a profound achievement."
781	3	a	Regardless of how you feel about the movie's message, you're certain to leave the movie feeling something about the movie itself.
782	3	a	Gorgeous cinematography, incredible landscapes, stunning fight sequences, and the seemingly ubiquitous Zhang Ziyi looking hot as ever
783	3	a	Just as funny as the original and far more essential.
784	5	a	If they can put a man on the moon, why can't they tell a better story about sending some flies along for the ride?
785	6	a	How does that writer take a whack at that franchise, and come up with something as convoluted and puffy as this?
786	3	a	Proves that a comedy based on sex need not be ham-fisted to be effective.
787	4	a	Silly but not hilarious ... with a message that's so simplistic you might miss it.
788	3	a	Tender, heartfelt and intriguingly structured albeit occasionally melodramatic. Annette Bening, Kerry Washington and Naomi Watts shine in their captivating, raw and brave performances. 
789	3	a	Not one of Sturges' best, but good enough.
790	0	a	Combine the characters, the story, the message, and the acting, and it's easy to see why It's a Wonderful Life isn't just a holiday favorite, but a great movie by almost any standards.
791	4	a	Director Darren Aronofsky creates an eerie Eraserhead-like world that keeps the film compelling.
792	1	a	Knocked Up is possibly the best comedy of the year.
793	6	a	Lively and enjoyable but nothing remotely special -- this could be just about any romantic comedy ever made, complete with a contrived premise and a bright cast to distract us from the same old formula.
794	6	a	I don't know if The Break-Up qualifies as a date movie. But it will serve as a cautionary tale for couples falling in love.
795	4	a	Depp-led cult-director bio delves into cross-dressing, kink.
796	2	a	The kick in this material, especially in this new version which plays down Mikael's surliness, is Lisbeth, a pixieish polysexual outlier who seems equipped with her own portable storm cloud.
797	4	a	The genial comedy has its funny moments, but overall lacks a knockout punch.
798	8	a	"Mars Needs Moms"" is only consistent in that it's a mess."
799	3	a	Best of all, Black understands the geography of an action sequence, and the advantage of an R rating.
800	3	a	There's good pulp and bad pulp, and for most of its duration, Joy Ride is quality stuff.
801	3	a	If the real-life story is genuinely inspirational, the movie stirs us as well.
802	3	a	A fuddy-duddy, buddy-buddy flick that makes up in sweetness what it lacks in surprise.
803	3	a	Film Stars Don't Die in Liverpool is a rich romance that mixes Old Hollywood with new.
804	1	a	All of this brilliance stems from the brilliant script from Labaki. One part 'The Florida Project' and one part struggle for survival, Labaki's work shines. 
805	6	a	Overbearingly cruel and only modestly funny.
806	5	a	Chadwick Boseman throws everything he has into his performance as the man who threw everything he had into his performance
807	4	a	The film is not a total loss due to its interesting use of suspense and its tactic of placing suspicion on every character. While it's not one of the best thrillers out there, you could easily do worse.
808	1	a	A funny, believable film about the ability of even the damaged and imperfect to earn a little happiness.
809	9	a	Jump on the bandwagon, because it's really THAT bad.
810	0	a	Citizen Kane is no relic. Pop in the DVD and you'll find what you least expect - a really cool flick.
811	3	a	Carnage Park delivers the thrill-ride such a twisted title suggests, as Mickey Keating's gun-slinging abandon paints the California desert a unique shade of red.
812	1	a	Logan Lucky is great fun and one of the most purely entertaining movies of the year.
813	6	a	Astro Boy definitely sets himself up for a sequel, and the overall scenario is ripe to explore many current issues. But let's hope the creators trade in the well-used parts for some fresh material.
814	7	a	The two central performances are competent but uninspired -- and annoyingly mannered. Pearce's Warhol is a one-note, irresponsible villain and Miller's Sedgwick is a shallow, pretentious party girl who chain-smokes her way through every scene.
815	3	a	Beginning with a long, slow tracking shot of a coal transport gondola being viewed by a man from his window, we immediately note a director in complete control. The scene is meticulously composed...
816	3	a	[Jenkins] turns what could have ended up a lurid sensationalist story into a rich portrait of life on the edge of society.
817	0	a	Haynes reminds us how bad things used to be. He also invites us to remember how beautiful mad love can be and to swoon along with it.
818	1	a	The Friends star announces herself as a true big-screen talent, channeling despair, hope, confusion and wry humor as the narrative oscillates wildly between Greek tragedy and acrid comedy.
819	4	a	A stoic Heston, a nice turn for Robinson, and see-through ironies.
820	4	a	As with Bridesmaids, Rose Byrne proves herself to be naturally funny, and the film is definitely cliche-averse: there is no way the story's final act would have survived the American test screening process.
821	5	a	Some good special effects but the story cannibalizes its own predecessor.
822	2	a	The battles, of which there are many, are unique in that they combine Roman fighting techniques with traditional Chinese martial arts, a visual that never gets boring. 
823	5	a	Retreat as quickly as possible.
824	3	a	Refreshingly touching and genuinely funny coming-of-age story, cleverly capturing a poignant, formative interlude.
825	3	a	Shults follows up his excellent Krisha with a movie that solidifies him as a director I will follow consistently. He plays with darkness and claustrophobia onscreen, but also makes his characters deeply human and relatable.
826	4	a	In the hands of a more competent director, Peter Morgan's strong script might have been turned into something more memorable.
827	6	a	...Blue Streak is simply unable to overcome the scenery-chewing excess of Lawrence's hopelessly incompetent turn.
828	1	a	This may be the first movie to capture the reckless exuberance of Pulp Fiction without seeming like a blatant rip-off.
829	2	a	A compassionate and darkly funny shaggy-dog story.
830	0	a	Welles's deeply haunting depiction of the life of William Randolph Hearst has long been synonymous with the director's spectacularly odd and genuinely tragic career.
831	4	a	Despite being visually stunning, it's as dry as hell.
832	3	a	There are scenes in The Passion that will remain forever with those who see it.
833	6	a	That rare film that strives for cult status and will most likely achieve it.
834	1	a	Light, amusingly macabre, droll, looking and sounding freshly minted...a marvelous holiday treat with luscious tricks up its sleeve.
835	6	a	The Last Witch Hunter remains inexplicably mundane and monotonous throughout, even when Vin Diesel swings a flaming broadsword at his supernatural nemesis, which should say something about how utterly devoid of cinematic magic it really is. 
836	4	a	It's fine in its way, a fond and silly salute to pub crawls, old friends, crap cars, roundabouts, British eccentricity and keeping your head in a crisis -- it's just terribly hit-and-miss.
837	1	a	"If you're not looking for a ""Fargo""-level masterpiece but just for a badass modern Western, it delivers plenty on that level."
838	9	a	If Hell does exist, I'm sure the only movie theatre in town will be playing nothing but Anthony Anderson movies.
839	4	a	James is much better than a lot of his contemporaries at this, eschewing over-the-top clowning for actual humanity. But it all gets thrown out the window in the second half. Maybe he'll do better next time.
840	2	a	It starts out breathlessly funny, fast-paced, and energetic before ultimately settling in to a standard biopic formula that's not nearly as compelling.
841	5	a	Not even very young kids will be over the moon.
842	2	a	A Private War, struggles with a question Colvin asked repeatedly: What do you have to show to make people care about other's suffering? It suffers the same dilemma as the media itself, numbing us with a message of helplessness. 
843	4	a	With minimal theatrics, Stallone shows us a man who never wanted anything more than to be a cop finally deciding to be one of the good guys.
844	6	a	You have no desire to see them either get back together or murder one another - you just want them to leave each other alone. And that's not exactly compelling cinema.
845	5	a	"Dated low budget rip-off of ""Star Wars"" has interesting cast."
846	6	a	Despite fine intentions and four lovely performances from the female leads, Our Little Sister is simply too light to be felt.
847	4	a	While it plays by the occult numbers too frequently to create any real sense of dread, the filmmakers summon up enough fresh fiendishness to sustain the interest.
848	2	a	Craig Brewer skillfully evokes an atmosphere of lingering racial hostility in America's Bible Belt for Black Snake Moan, a cleverly scripted redemption story that defies genre and is filled with surprises both harrowing and pleasant.
849	6	a	Despite its heart-tugging machinations, there's a compelling sense of decency that drives the film, underscored at the end by footage of the real-life counterparts.
850	9	a	"Forster doesn't do whimsy, introducing a depressive glaze to ""Robin"" in a bid to remain emotionally authentic while still fiddling with the bouncy, ditzy characteristics of the titular boy's beloved stuffed animal army."
851	5	a	Christopher Robin tries hard to capture some of the magic inherent in Milne's work, but it's not an easy quality to pin down. When you head into the Hundred-Acre Woods, it's frightfully easy to get lost.
852	6	a	To say he was complicated doesn't even begin to scratch the surface of what Tupac was really about. Unfortunately, neither does this film.
853	6	a	We don't learn much that's new from this perspective, and we don't learn much about the man at the center of the story...
854	3	a	Could have been more with such a great cast, but still manages to entertain.
855	9	a	I've seen the future, and all I can say is...go back.
856	3	a	I don't quite know what the point of it all was, but I do know that I enjoyed watching it.
857	3	a	A witty script and fantastic performances, particularly from a nearly-unrecognisable Daniel Craig, make this more than just another crime caper.
858	5	a	A rare category of date movie: We wish it played more like other date movies.
859	3	a	"Awkward ""Seventeen"" ultimately rights itself."
860	5	a	"'American Pastoral' the novel is a primal scream. ""American Pastoral"" the movie is a whimper."
861	5	a	Truly terrible.
862	6	a	The movie plays like a series of scene outlines -- ideas for how the movie should progress -- that needed more writing and revision before the actors were called in.
863	7	a	The movie is a near-relentless intellectual muddle, throwing out signifiers and metaphors lazily and to no particular effect.
864	6	a	The most offensive thing about the movie is its hypocrisy; it is totally committed to the pornography of violence, but lays on the moral outrage with a shovel.
865	4	a	Its blend of breezy music biz satire, quirky characters and rumbustious action is rather endearing.
866	3	a	Precisely what an adventure epic should be: huge, long, and lots of fun.
867	3	a	Weapons-grade Oscar-bait designed to earn months of plaudits before being promptly forgotten.
868	0	a	One of [Van Sant's] most razor-sharp films, with an involving plot, solidly realistic characters and exquisite cinematography.
869	6	a	Liz maybe the most unlikeable character Julia Roberts has ever had to play, not because co-writer/director Ryan Murphy is trying to make her so but because everything the film does pushes her in that direction.
870	5	a	This is no Rudolph.
871	3	a	'Si bien no logra desarrollarse como un gran drama, tampoco es tan superficial como muchas cintas que pecan de pretenciosas y que resultan totalmente banales.'
872	4	a	Sluggishly paced but otherwise harmless drama about coming of age in South Korea.
873	4	a	It may not be suitable for kids, but that's not to say that this strenuously profane cartoon is not unapologetically juvenile in its approach to comedy.
874	3	a	Talk to Me helps make the case that Don Cheadle may be one of the most important American actors working in film today.
875	6	a	A respectable enough love story that holds so much promise, yet doesn't seem to have had the screenplay kinks worked out before shooting commenced.
876	5	a	A huge let down - surprisingly coming from Shane Black. [Full review in Spanish]
877	9	a	I still can't say for sure whether the director and screenwriters were in on the joke all along.
878	4	a	The 'Final Destination' franchise is the Ramones discography of horror cinema: There's not a lot of variety, but if you liked the first release, there's no reason not to like the rest.
879	1	a	Most importantly, Call Me By Your Name is an honest story of hearts on fire, broken, and then healed, with wise affection for its characters and their struggles, and a message of tolerance and love for us all.
880	5	a	The most important missing ingredient is Mr. Coppola.
881	10	a	The Wedding Date reveals no trace of recognizable human behavior in it.
882	8	a	Into the Blue should be thrown overboard -- preferably somewhere in the Bermuda Triangle.
883	5	a	Man of the Year, the weaker brother of the Wag the Dog and Good Morning Vietnam polital satire family, relies heavily on conceptual humour and Robin Williams' shenanigans to carry the boneless plot through.
884	1	a	The tension that builds throughout Valkyrie is palpable and the plot is incredibly compelling.
885	1	a	Penn's sensitive screenplay and Hirsch's engaging performance show us McCandless's ability to connect to the subtlest signals from the widest range of people and to the grandest scope of nature.
886	7	a	You, Me and Dupree mostly sputters.
887	3	a	...as a piece of pure escapist entertainment, you'd be hard-pressed to find a more enjoyable way to spend two hours.
888	1	a	Director Steven Soderbergh is back and firing on all cylinders in Logan Lucky, a Southern-fried heist comedy that is, like its main characters, smarter than it lets on.
889	3	a	Making a movie about the life of Ed Wood certainly qualifies as an impossible dream, but Burton has pulled it off with wit, imagination and something amazingly close to grace.
890	1	a	Here a mature filmmaker at the top of his game muses on life after death. But this is no starry-eyed, gullible wallow in the bathos of eternal bliss.
891	4	a	Writer-director Michel Hazanavicius toys with despair only to gloss over it.
892	4	a	The Hobbit may be a different story to The Lord Of The Rings ... but there is really nothing all that unexpected about this journey.
893	5	a	Meandering, occasionally funny, wannabe fanciful.
894	6	a	This is an arcade game, designed to deliver thrills and chills. This is does.
895	6	a	The gags fall flat as often as they hit their mark.
896	1	a	A superb drama that is part murder-mystery, part portrait of harsh inner-city life.
897	3	a	Though there's tension between the two halves of Talk to Me, both of them are quite good.
898	5	a	The film is sporadically entertaining and intends to be profound but has nothing to say about life except we shouldn't waste a single precious moment of it. But I learned that already from Jim Carrey in Yes Man, and in nearly half the time.
899	4	a	An average movie with sometimes clunky dialogue ... Liam Neeson makes a great Mark Felt.
900	1	a	Delivered big with breathtaking location work and an all-star cast...
901	1	a	Hereafter is deep and deliberate. It requires patience and emotional maturity from its audience. Those willing to give it will be rewarded with a cinematic experience that is complex, heartfelt and spiritually uplifting.
902	2	a	If the part is not much of a mental or emotional stretch for him, [Eminem] acquits himself well enough for me to want to see him in other films.
903	4	a	The purgatorial premise is pleasingly eccentric but, in the end, Wristcutters falls victim to its washed-out mood, and limps bloodlessly to a close.
904	0	a	A film like no other, and even if only to simply bear witness to such a bold, experimental work, it commands a viewing.
905	4	a	A well-wrought, if highly subjective, introduction to Shakur, especially for the curious.
906	6	a	An ambitious but confused and frustrating film that circles near catharsis, occasionally brushing its hem, but that's about as close as it ever gets.
907	3	a	A supremely entertaining adventure that might threaten to fall over a couple of times but always regains its balance.
908	3	a	Both women are magnificent and it's thanks to them, and to Haynes's refined talent, that this story of love and passion is so convincing, so tender, and so painful.
909	3	a	Both [Spacey's and Whaley's] renditions are alarmingly true to life in a very unsettling way.
910	6	a	"There are resonant moments of elderly vulnerability and strong acting from Hoffman and Bosco, but Linney's overly familiar exasperated-woman performance and Jenkins' been-there, done-that-better story sink ""The Savages."
911	9	a	"Dramatically inert, satirically inept and thematically insufferable, ""Billy Lynn's Long Halftime Walk"" is the most disappointing film of the year."
912	2	a	The Bourne Identity is an intriguing and action packed spy thriller. It lacks a big payoff at the end, but is otherwise entertaining.
913	2	a	Frequently hilarious, and the kind of balanced portrayal of small-town life that you rarely see. It's just too bad the dull construction made it feel like it was trying to give me seasonal affective disorder.
914	2	a	"Annette Bening is so good in ""Film Stars Don't Die in Liverpool"" that it makes up for a story that's slighter than it should be."
915	1	a	Fincher's electrifying storytelling makes the most of unsettling visuals, large casts, complex plots and sharp dialogue.
916	6	a	If you slammed the heads of Lucy and Carrie together, The Lazarus Effect would be the messy aftermath left on the ground.
917	5	a	The often incoherent and repetitive plot doesn't have enough thrilling action to redeem its other shortcomings.
918	0	a	David Oyelowo is superb; film is remarkably topical and relevant.
919	6	a	"The laughs and pacing of Fun Mom Dinner may be uneven, but days later I'm still smiling at the thought of the dispensary's recommended strain: the Ruth Bader Ganja, which ""gets you supremely high."" It's the little moments that matter here."
920	3	a	Gorgeous to look at, and a matter-of-fact paean to the possibility of human decency, The Way Back makes the genre-juggling dream quest of Inception look like child's play. 
921	5	a	Acting is best left to actors, lest you get this kind of shiftless, awkwardly mumbling emptiness going on for the entire length of a very drearily slow-moving movie.
922	6	a	Weitz suffers what can only be called a failure of will. He backs off when he should be bearing down.
923	1	a	Leaves the viewer in a contradictory state, a mixture of devastation and euphoria, amusement and dismay that deserves its own clinical designation.
924	2	a	A third act cameo sets a high water mark of awesome, especially for fans of Deadwood.
925	3	a	It is devastating, superbly played and deftly made. It is wonderful.
926	3	a	Bizarrely amusing.
927	5	a	The natural charisma of the two leads is about the only thing that saves Identity Thief; it's a very generic, very lazy Hollywood comedy.
928	3	a	It's not one of Disney's greatest, but it's solid entertainment.
929	1	a	Pike dives in deeply, bringing Colvin to life both physically and soulfully. It's a powerful performance.
930	4	a	I admit I had a good time at Next Friday. All I'm saying is, don't pay more than matinee price for the privilege.
931	4	a	You can't stop him or crop him/He's in widescreen and large/He ain't playing when he's baggin' Curtis Hanson for Sarge... [Blu-ray]
932	0	a	As dark as it gets, like Batman Begins before it, it's also a wildly entertaining movie.
933	2	a	Aside from a few music-intensive segments that go on far too long, the story moves along at a brisk clip and there are a handful of good jolts along the way.
934	2	a	Crimson Peak - despite some obvious and repetitive story beats - is a film that deserves to be experienced as unsullied as possible...just leave your craving for horror at the door.
935	0	a	An extraordinary film about adoption and the lives of three very different women on separate quests for love, nurturing, and personal fulfillment.
936	1	a	Essentially a stunt, but an expertly executed one that's immensely enjoyable, especially for movie buffs...a nimble, exuberant lark.
937	6	a	It's almost like the movie is afraid of what it should be -- a young, frisky love story that should be exuberant and carefree, even if it means risking making a fool of itself. What's love, after all, if it doesn't do exactly that?
938	3	a	Bale makes it all frighteningly real. And lots of fun.
939	5	a	If you have seen the first two Final Destination movies, you know what you are getting into. If you haven't seen the first two, why start now? 
940	4	a	Will engross you while you're there but will fall apart in your mind as you begin to think about it later.
941	7	a	As Neil Sedaka famously observed, breaking up is hard to do, but it proves even harder to watch in this shrill, sour comedy.
942	3	a	A big, dumb piece of fun that will do little for your heart or intellect, but will undoubtedly leave you laughing.
943	5	a	No matter how visually impressive Silent Hill may be, the incredibly weak story makes it a horrible film.
944	6	a	Good, solid acting can't overcome a fuzzy script and poor editing.
945	5	a	An indescribable little film of behaviors and performance, and while that effort is commendable, the picture can't help but come off insincere, waiting patiently for some sign of cinematic life that isn't completely affected.
946	2	a	If you're expecting classic comedy, you likely won't enjoy Tommy Boy, but if you have Saturday Night Live-level expectations, it will be a pleasant surprise.
947	0	a	This is a great movie, and I am not surprised to find Susan Sontag describing it as 'one of the most extraordinary, beautiful, and original works of art that I know of.'
948	3	a	The plot has more holes in it than the victims, but the shocks make up for the flaws. Don't think, just watch, and expect a wild ride.
949	4	a	...a watchable yet forgettable piece of work...
950	6	a	An unconvincing generalization about people the filmmakers never care enough about to understand.
951	3	a	Whether you see the 'The Artist' for its nostalgia or its novelty, its joyous spirit is undeniable.
952	3	a	A tearjerker that's got both a brain and a heart.
953	4	a	"Hotel for Dogs"" is naturally attractive because of the sheer number of dogs in the film, suitable for any dog lover such as myself..."
954	6	a	Rather than getting lost in the world Scott has created on screen, Scott asks filmgoers to marvel at how he created that world, and how smoothly he succeeds in manipulating us.
955	1	a	A showy balancing act.
956	6	a	The chess scenes, especially toward the end, are filmed with an attempted frenzy that borders on laughable.
957	9	a	It's like Midnight Run while at the same time completely missing what makes Midnight Run work. Melissa McCarthy deserves better.
958	3	a	Works as a capsule -- a snapshot -- of what American metropolitan dating has become: a game of social defense.
959	5	a	Cook has a nice comic personality but zilch in the way of comic material. But then, it's not as if any of those teenage boys are going to care about that.
960	6	a	The Cloverfield Paradox is a disjointed, but enjoyable sci-fi horror/thriller that has mixed success as a shared universe film.
961	6	a	I sympathized a bit too dearly with Schreck, who desires sustenance.
962	4	a	The film is cute, saccarhine, overlong, at times overbearing...but not completely unpleasant.
963	5	a	Cranston's talent - and Furman's - go a little to waste.
964	4	a	Ultimately suffers from a loss of nerve and an inconsistency of tone...
965	4	a	Seinfeld's observational humor is relegated to the edges of a lightweight story.
966	2	a	Directed by and starring Streisant, this is a charming gender-bending fable, too bad the music is so undistinguished.
967	5	a	The only exception to the film's tone comes, not surprisingly, from Nighy, who artfully dredges up a miniscule portion of fun from the otherwise unfun proceedings.
968	8	a	...consistently funny, occasionally clever and undoubtedly unmissable if you're a baked potato. 
969	6	a	The Passion of the Christ is at once a well-crafted film, a merciless excursion into motion-picture ultraviolence, and a regrettably cramped historical account that stays doggedly on the surface of its overwhelmingly important subject.
970	6	a	The climax was just as incredulous as Clint's unconvincing look at the hereafter.
971	6	a	Has its fair share of adrenaline, but the plot is shot through with more holes than Christina Aguilera's favorite awards outfit.
972	5	a	Fifteen years ago, a movie with Streisand, Hoffman and DeNiro in starring roles would have been considered the casting coup of the ages.
973	3	a	Old baseball wisdom: The best teams win with strong fundamentals. So do the best movies.
974	9	a	A waste of time.
975	2	a	Amid the glut of teen dreck that usually insults our intelligence, Donnie Darko shines.
976	5	a	"Two great performers lose out because ""The Soloist"" has the potential to be better than the directed product."
977	9	a	Those who take something of value from a sermon about the necessity for self-sacrifice will certainly be drawn into this well-meaning movie, but those looking for genuine drama should probably look elsewhere.
978	5	a	Not even DePalma, at his sleaziest, or Hitchcock, at his most sexually frustrated, dared to be so unabashedly ugly.
979	6	a	...aspires mostly to nonchalance.
980	3	a	Damon makes Bourne a consistent, driven, intelligent, and yet vulnerable hero. It's too bad Academy voters will fail to notice his fantastic performance.
981	5	a	It is exceedingly difficult to make convincing live-action versions of cult cartoon strips, and this big-screen version of the momentarily popular TV series is one of the least successful attempts.
982	5	a	Starts off with a shocking, emotional opening scene, but that's the last exciting and interesting thing to happen in the movie. 
983	3	a	Peter Jackson triumphantly returns to Middle Earth with The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey. A folksy, beguiling adventure, we get to enjoy the splendor of the story and fantastic settings in a more whimsical experience.
984	3	a	Forgive the film its small flaws of histrionic performances and cheap execution for the giddy rush of its banal, Verhoevenesque atmosphere...
985	4	a	The strangeness is off the scale in a kooky concoction that might have been hatched at the bottom of a bong. Then again, what do you expect with Johnny involved?
986	2	a	A fresh, free-spirited form of fantasy, Jackson's latest provides a younger generation with a stepping stone to his later films while serving the adult's who want more. 
987	3	a	Ideology is manifested as empathy, rather than polemic, and the result is a lean, powerful little film that's more about people than politics.
988	2	a	It is intensely personal and yet -- unlike Quills -- deftly shows us the temper of the times.
989	4	a	[This] bromantic drama...becomes as frustratedly impotent as Lopez feels, and as chokingly symbolic as Ayers looks with an Uncle Sam top hat on his head and an American flag in his shopping cart. [Blu-ray]
990	4	a	Much better in memory...
991	4	a	Krasinski literalizes Wallace's stylistic love of asides too much, but it helps that he's aware enough of his movie's limitations to keep Brief Interviews blessedly short.
992	4	a	although Jenkins does seem to be hip to the fact that Wuornos was lying about her supposed motivations for all the killings, the film has a tendency to let her off the hook.
993	9	a	Every scene is as achingly long and laboured as the film's instantly forgettable title.
994	9	a	As one might anticipate with a comedy about children and the outdoors, a lot of screen time is devoted to bodily noises and throwing up.
995	5	a	The result may not plumb Shyamalanian awfulness, but if you did get to the afterlife you'd hope they weren't playing this movie.
996	1	a	There's a difference between a great performance and a Great Performance. Julianne Moore's turn as a professor afflicted with early onset Alzheimer's easily qualifies as the latter. 
997	2	a	Manages the considerable feat of interweaving the personal dramas of nine members of a boisterous Irish-American clan into a coherent mosaic with a streamlined narrative drive.
998	5	a	Kinda stupid, kinda funny. It's the ultimate fall film.
999	4	a	Not The Bad Seed but not bad.
1000	3	a	From its gripping immediacy to its strong cast of unknowns, Sweet Sixteen feels almost like a documentary. Loach and screenwriter Paul Laverty keep an evenhanded focus on harsh truths, and avoid melodrama and grandstanding.
1001	9	a	The musical number that runs during the closing credits is funnier than anything that precedes it, which isn't saying much.
1002	0	a	Accurate, heartbreaking masterpiece about the Holocaust.
1003	5	a	A movie we've seen and heard before, fresher, cuter and five years ago. 
1004	0	a	A timeless romance with a preserved space in the books of cinema history. [Full review in Spanish]
1005	3	a	The characters are funny because they're only human
1006	3	a	Writer-director Craig Brewer returns with another look at Southern discomfort deep-fried in a greasy pool of sex and song.
1007	5	a	Every action both parties take, over roughly a dozen years, seems motivated by the understanding that there'll be no movie unless they do it.
1008	2	a	Shults builds an effective atmosphere of mistrust and dread, with even the slightest hint of deception eating away at the fragile alliance among the characters.
1009	5	a	It's not helped by the wooden performances of the leads.
1010	3	a	This movie needed two decades to grow into what it is, which is a worthy sequel to a modern classic.
1011	3	a	Shows surprising restraint for an American remake, effective atmosphere from cinematographer Bojan Bazelli, good acting from Watts and some nice surprises.
1012	9	a	If only there were some kind of federal bureau that could handle the investigation of such crimes, everything might be resolved easily and quickly.
1013	4	a	Parker contributes a performance as the flustered but determined Kate Reddy that proves that she can transcend Sex and The City.
1014	5	a	...a limp Vogue layout: easy on the eyes, completely devoid of anything else.
1015	4	a	The plot, once you have time to think about it, should so obviously never have been cleared for takeoff.
1016	0	a	Loretta Lynn's tough but heartwarming biopic.
1017	8	a	Couples, retreat: this movie has the power to make any date feel as endless and soul-sucking as the lifetime's worth of defective, hateful marriages that doom the film's protagonists.
1018	2	a	It does focus on spirituality, a vital part of most human beings which nevertheless is absent in most films.
1019	3	a	Greengrass knew not to screw up a good thing.
1020	4	a	Enjoyable at the beginning and at the end, but the middle portion had my mind wandering.
1021	4	a	Fey is really quite wonderful in the film, which despite the trailer is more of a drama with some clever jokes than a comedy, per se. But, despite her best efforts, the movie could have been much more.
1022	5	a	Better than I thought it would be [but] it's still a big ball of garbage.
1023	1	a	It's a harrowing study of this man's life, portrayed in claustrophobic compositions ... [and] Hawke's precisely tuned performance...
1024	1	a	The true brilliance of David Oyelowo's work--and that of Ava DuVernay, for that matter--lies in the delicate balance between duly respecting King as a historical icon and incisively studying King as a man. 
1025	4	a	Director/writer Nimrod Antal has made an extremely accomplished feature debut. With production designer Balazs Hujber, he has created a bizarrely original underground world of shadows and garish light.
1026	4	a	The incessant comic relief, clumsy and cumbersome, too often gets in the way of a cracking good tale.
1027	0	a	The way Ozu builds up emotional empathy for a sense of disappointment in its various characters is where his mastery lies.
1028	1	a	Marsh tells this story clearly and sympathetically, and he has the backlog of film and the witnesses to do so.
1029	5	a	A filmed bloodletting like no other on record, essentially a terribly graphic two-hour torture sequence.
1030	4	a	Kevin James is the film's greatest asset by far.
1031	0	a	One of the most impactful, poignant, thought-provoking movies about faith ever made.
1032	5	a	A smutty script and a passel of objectionable characters form an imperfect rom-com union - one that will, with any luck, fade from the mind long before its title suggests.
1033	9	a	It's for folks who fetishize indie-style ineptitude and amateurishness.
1034	2	a	"Francis McDormand is undeniable as Mildred in ""Three Billboards."" Her performance as Mildred is the glue that prevents this muddy, Middle American morality tale from navigating McDonagh plot dalliances"
1035	6	a	If watching cartoon characters spout four-letter words is your thing, this might well be the greatest movie ever made. 
1036	1	a	The picture's greatest strength rests in its characters.
1037	5	a	A mediocre 'man-on-the-run' crime drama without any twists or likable three-dimensional characters to keep your interest.
1038	4	a	Whiskey Tango Foxtrot ultimately takes fewer risks than its protagonist.
1039	1	a	One of the most visually astonishing martial-arts fantasies ever made.
1040	5	a	The film is sold on the idea that the real-life heroes play themselves, but it's a fatal mistake that undercuts what few good scenes the film does offer outside of the train attack
1041	5	a	While it may not ultimately prove memorable enough to launch a new film franchise, The Green Hornet is still a fun action-comedy and clever superhero satire that's about as close to a cool summer movie as you're going to get in the dead of winter.
1042	3	a	The Wedding Banquet does take some of the same delight in constructing a comedy of misunderstandings and deceptions. But the movie also has a warm heart, and by the end somehow manages to become very moving.
1043	6	a	Rather than an epic continuation of Jackson's Middle-earth obsession, the film seems more like the work of a man driving around a multilevel parking garage without being able to find the exit.
1044	2	a	A cannily structured piece of pulpy pop entertainment marked by a starry lead performance and some histrionic supporting turns. It doesn't have much depth, but the surface keeps you engaged.
1045	1	a	Weir's movie is superbly made, but its fancy-dancing around history gives a hint of inauthenticity to a film that otherwise thrives on its reverence for historical detail.
1046	0	a	One of the best movies about childhood ever made because it's really a movie for adults. Without sentiment, it looks at the fears, doubts, and anxieties of childhood.
1047	6	a	Fleeting and superficial, it's the familiar, cliche-riddled show biz rise and fall with banal notes about substance abuse and the price of fame.
1048	4	a	A charming spoof of cold-war alien paranoia, this is visually inventive and full of action, but could do with more humour.
1049	3	a	"It is less that Allen is repeating himself with ""Midnight in Paris"" than that he has once again crafted a work, about the enduring and ephemeral power of the artist, in his own image."
1050	1	a	Proudly wears science fiction influences on its sleeve, and has a ball doing it, but the personal character journey inward expertly trumps any lip service to a specific genre
1051	6	a	Despite year-end plaudits and the promising reunion of Haynes and cinematographer Lachman, this proves a fairly anemic forbidden-love melodrama ... Blanchett turns in a rare one-note performance.
1052	3	a	The grim druggy undertow of the original is absent, with regret and redemption providing trickles of pathos amid the capers and carry-on. A worthy postscript.
1053	4	a	A movie made in the spirit of: what the world needs now is a bit of innocent diversion.
1054	3	a	The earthshaking footfalls of these lizard-kings are palpable and terrifying. Spielberg's crew of dinosaur-effects artists has conjured up a Mesozoic menagerie whose realism outdoes anything in cinema history.
1055	3	a	Unlike an Austen story, Becoming Jane doesn't suffer from a predictable third act, and the characters aren't quite so schematic.
1056	3	a	Jackson imposes a sense of grandeur but mostly loses Tolkien's sense of fun.
1057	5	a	Are we really expected to admire these prigs? Worship them? Take their wealth away and what are these people? Absolutely nothing; just vacant vessels blandly consuming overpriced food and drink. 
1058	5	a	The Wayans brothers are funny guys. But this is the kind of premise that should have stayed in cartoon-land.
1059	3	a	Writer-director Tim Blake Nelson...makes the film compelling by designing it not to horrify, but to testify.
1060	3	a	Fast Five'' is, so far, the most honest Hollywood movie of the year. It's also the most fun.
1061	0	a	The Artist is wordless. In a parallel mode, so are we, dumbstruck, at a loss for the superlatives that might match this cinematic wonder ... which very well may be the best film of the year.
1062	5	a	Ten minutes into this film and I wanted out too.
1063	0	a	Thoroughly entertaining Hollywood fare which holds up a dope as a person deserving of admiration.
1064	2	a	Actually one of the year's more pleasant surprises, though it misses being more than that through a combination of length and a sometimes sloppy, meandering screenplay.
1065	4	a	There's no shortage of movies about male sad-sacks who are stuck in a rut, but this one, though predictable, is mildly funny and warmly likable thanks to fine casting and sympathetic performances. 
1066	5	a	The metaphor, that a society that doesn't recognize the evil it is doing might be getting its comeuppance, would have been a cool subtext in a better movie. But this 'Dead' doesn't jolt, shock, scare or amuse. It just staggers along -- very, very slowly.
1067	7	a	Really dumb but occasionally really funny.
1068	3	a	The humor and the villainy have bite, the acting has conviction, the effects look far less cheesy, and the storytelling actually conveys the imagination and emotional power of Rowling's prose.
1069	6	a	Well, I'm not sure the world needed two whole minutes of a gastrically panicked Neil Patrick Harris defecating in hats.
1070	3	a	From a strictly visual standpoint, the film is like nothing you've ever seen. In terms of story, however, you've seen it all before.
1071	2	a	A heady, messy piece of existential angst that works against all odds.
1072	0	a	Keenly observed and beautifully acted, Danny Leiner's The Great New Wonderful is a seriocomic gem of rare grace and psychological nuance.
1073	4	a	It helps that every performance is remarkable.
1074	4	a	A promising idea about a superhero with an existential crisis wobbles through wildly misjudged moments and then has something of an existential crisis of its own.
1075	4	a	A good bit of entertainment that will not replace Paper Moon in the film history books
1076	1	a	A dazzling, spooky visual masterpiece...One of the year's best.
1077	3	a	A sly, deconstructionist approach to Bond combined with a climactic sequence that is hands-down the best, most gorgeously shot, and most breathtakingly thrilling in the franchise's history make this one of the most satisfying and well-made entries.
1078	3	a	A daunting, challenging film that dares the viewer to like it. And, it's not the easiest movie to like, but it's impossible not to find disturbingly fascinating. 
1079	0	a	"Monster"" is no ""Pretty Woman"" or Cinderella story and Theron's role is a fuse that ignites controversy."
1080	3	a	Suspenseful, poignant wilderness film; a few gross scenes.
1081	4	a	The musical part is still a guilty pleasure. [Full Review in Spanish]
1082	0	a	This one's for those who know teenagers, have teenagers, are teenagers or have ever been teenagers. You know. Everyone.
1083	9	a	The use of digital effects to place Wayans' face on a child performer's body isn't even remotely amusing. It's simply creepy.
1084	3	a	It could have been a truly great film in more sure hands, but it just misses the mark.
1085	5	a	The Tourist has all the hallmarks of a sleekly diverting Euro-thriller, and sets about proving that hallmarks are not enough.
1086	4	a	A far cry from some of the better 'rockumentaries' out there.
1087	5	a	... recycles so much material it's a wonder the film stock didn't turn green during filming.
1088	3	a	Unrelenting, passionate, and churning with humanity, A Private War is a film befitting its remarkable heroine.
1089	3	a	Delivers on its promise to scare the living daylights out of those willing to take the journey with the unsuspecting characters in the movie.
1090	3	a	Cowboy character study mixes violence and depth; some peril.
1091	3	a	Having found much to laugh at in the first half-hour of Early Man, it is with regret that I have to report that the movie falls off after that.
1092	1	a	Murray has never been better than he is here, but then he's never had a part that fit him so well, either.
1093	4	a	Cutting right to the chase, Fast Five is sure to make a furious run at the box office.
1094	4	a	It's another Bridesmaids-inspired stumble through the tropes of bad-girl comedy, which includes the mandatory set-piece involving the expulsion of bodily waste...and plenty of blue talk, which is now a regular, if not defining, feature of female comedy. 
1095	9	a	Yet another tired Chris Lee Dracula romp
1096	3	a	Although I loved this movie, I'm getting tired of the King of Queens world where attractive, capable women fall in love with/end up mothering shlubby, childish men.
1097	1	a	Shockingly effective and incomprehensibly great, No Country for Old Men proves that the Coen Brothers are America's reigning motion picture Gods.
1098	4	a	A long, ambitious, fitfully rewarding movie.
1099	8	a	"Watching ""Identity Thief"" made me feel bad for Jason Bateman."
1100	1	a	It's a well crafted, marvelously acted, fun piece of fluff. It may not be the best film of the year, but it's certainly one of the most watchable, anchored by a stunning performance by Hopkins. 
1101	5	a	Everyone will wonder why these girls continue to trust a king who constantly betrays them and wears such pimp-tastic fur.
1102	4	a	This ramshackle movie features a preposterous plot, dodgy direction and clunky editing, and yet it's great fun to watch the actors squirm with fear.
1103	3	a	Campion's story of a tubercular poet and his lady love recasts the hackneyed old stanza in refreshing new verse.
1104	0	a	This teaming, including a brilliant and freshly adaptive cast combines for a most engrossing bit of entertainment that maintains tension and credibility throughout.
1105	0	a	The beauty of the piece is that it counts heart as important as humor.
1106	3	a	There's some memorable one-liners, well drawn characters, and an ending that'll have folks debating what truly happened after the screen has gone dark. 
1107	0	a	What Daniel Day-Lewis did for Lincoln, Oyelowo does for King, mimicking his behavior and speech uncannily. He is both completely believable and someone we've never encountered before.
1108	4	a	... there's just something innately charming about its stop-motion that stops you from ever feeling too disappointed.
1109	2	a	This is an inspired idea for a rom-com, and Mazer makes it pay off with a climactic speech that's at once a parody of the genre and utterly, bizarrely heartfelt.
1110	3	a	[The] metaphysical context benefits enormously from the haunting musical themes that Neil Young wrote, underlining the film's psychedelic/apocalyptic edge, and from the stunning black-and-white camera work of Robby Muller.
1111	4	a	Not even Depp can quite save the relentless obviousness and preposterous turns.
1112	0	a	While this is clearly the most controversial film of the year, but I also happen to think it might also be the its most brilliant as well.
1113	7	a	"[VIDEO ESSAY] As a premise, a doomed marriage sounds like a no-brainer: you can pile on outrageous episodes of slapstick, physical comedy and biting wit. Unfortunately, ""I Give It a Year"" is a no-brainer."
1114	6	a	Takes the 'everything-but-the-kitchen-sink' approach. Leaves no sports cliche unturned and no chance for inspirational feel-good moments unvisited.
1115	6	a	Bad move, Barry. You should have quit while you were ahead.
1116	3	a	Intelligent adult fare is hard to find on the big screen, but Clint Eastwood manages nicely with this tough ensemble piece.
1117	4	a	Ulliel's impressive facial dexterity keeps his expressions devoid of emotion, except for slowly sadistic smiles, careful enunciation, and an occasional Hopkins-worthy eye twitch.
1118	3	a	"Secret Window"" is taut, credible, and thoroughly entertaining, and features another eccentric -- and uncommonly good -- performance from Johnny Depp."
1119	4	a	The story is ridiculous and not every plot point makes sense, but if you're willing to turn your brain off and abandon any second thinking, the entertainment value is high.
1120	2	a	A fitting showcase for Philip Seymour Hoffman's tousled talents ... and a sad epitaph of a title for one of Hollywood's most talented character actors. 
1121	4	a	Compelling viewing because of the tight-lipped, bull-headed performance by John Travolta in a starring role.
1122	7	a	This may be the most gratuitous film I've seen this year.
1123	4	a	Despite the talent involved, The Light Between Oceans is mawkish when it should be moving.
1124	4	a	For all of the weight of history it carries, it's the rare biopic that actually works as both a personal story and an exploration of America's past.
1125	4	a	A kind of family fare that is rare on the big screen these days.
1126	1	a	By the conclusion of the story, you'll think of the strange and sometimes amazing relationships you've had during your life.
1127	5	a	I think I recall a few of the jokes from the Ford administration. Which makes sense because as irreverent and subversive as it wants to be, it is just bland.
1128	6	a	Unfortunately the script is too smart for its own good.
1129	4	a	Pi is an interesting film. Not a particularly good one, but interesting nonetheless.
1130	4	a	Fascinating in its depiction of a troubled relationship between sisters that is anything but black and white. This emotionally ripe angle to a tragic story that could have been told any number of ways is where the film gets its potency.
1131	5	a	The end ultimately justifies the means; whether viewers will want to stick it out is another thing. 
1132	9	a	"The Super"" has spent a little too much time in the editing room, emerging as an overly managed chiller that's not particularly scary. Mostly bewildering. "
1133	4	a	Not. Much. Happens. What does is predictable and trite. But it's a genial trifle with a booty-shaking vibe.
1134	3	a	makes a surprisingly cogent, if gleefully vulgar, political argument that has legs because it doesn't take easy sides
1135	1	a	The result, a defiant slap at slick Hollywood formula, is mesmerizing.
1136	3	a	An affecting and authentic portrayal of a young boy's attempt to understand the adult world.
1137	4	a	Benedict Cumberbatch's sensitive, moving performance is the film's beating heart, and the best reason to see it.
1138	1	a	A serious drama that is also funny without crossing into burlesque.
1139	5	a	You might want to stick sharpened knitting needles in your ears.
1140	2	a	By the end of the movie, you care enough about the characters to want a sequel, even though life probably goes on predictably for them in Smaland.
1141	1	a	"The Rider"" is a masterful character study that honors but doesn't romanticize a vanishing way of life."
1142	6	a	Loses steam faster than a cup of hot cocoa on a frozen lake.
1143	6	a	Larry Crowne doesn't come close to providing the rom-com satisfactions of films attached to the names Hanks and Roberts, or writer Nia Vardalos for that matter.
1144	6	a	While their last movie relied on boisterous physical humor, this is built on a family feud.
1145	1	a	Wry, whimsical and sure of tone, dry in all of the right ways and without an ounce of condescension.
1146	0	a	Javier Bardem's Chigurh is the embodiment of Sheriff Bell's exasperation -- a mythological, Grim Reaper-like figure whose existence makes order and civility implausible.
1147	6	a	Sheds essential exposition in a mad, foolish dash to the finish line.
1148	3	a	Mercifully, Ciro Guerra's film is not another Heart of Darkness-style meditation on the so-called white man's burden.
1149	2	a	Paul Rudd is an American treasure - America's Male Sweetheart - and he carries the film effortlessly
1150	4	a	With a distinct visual sensibility, Gia proves she's one more Coppola to watch.
1151	5	a	An ugly, ugly film that leaves you feeling dirty inside, especially if you find yourself being entertained and amused by its characters and what they do to each other. 
1152	3	a	The characters are vivid and often hilariously revolting.... Visually, the film is absolutely gorgeous.
1153	6	a	All brain, no heart.
1154	2	a	Miami Vice isn't a particularly accurate translation of the show - and depending on your point of view that could be good or bad - but it is a stylish, if uninspired, crime thriller.
1155	3	a	...so eager to sell the sizzle that the lack of a steak barely registers.
1156	4	a	Enjoyable hogwash.
1157	8	a	There isn't a single reason to see this movie. 
1158	3	a	It provides plenty of observations of the man's flaws, while offering no judgment of those flaws.
1159	6	a	A very aptly named movie.
1160	4	a	As a technical achievement [the characters] are astounding. It's too bad they weren't put into a plot that felt less hackneyed.
1161	0	a	Ninotchka is delicate flirtation and political satire made into a perfect whole, and a reminder of skills that studio writers have largely lost.
1162	7	a	...the film loves itself so much it renders itself beautiful, but utterly shallow.
1163	4	a	Corny, schmaltzy and predictable, but still manages to be kind of heartwarming, nonetheless. It's the perfect kind of film to see when you don't want to use your brain. At all.
1164	3	a	There's truly not a wasted moment in this film, which is astounding for such a young director.
1165	3	a	An uncompromising, dark and hilarious film.
1166	0	a	No Country for Old Men is an action film both measured and grave, opening as a Jim Thompson-esque crime saga set on the Texan sands, but as it moves along the film acquires an allegorical depth.
1167	1	a	There's no boogeyman. There's no hope for a cure. There's just the dread of losing someone you love, and that's a terror that is universal.
1168	3	a	One can't imagine the Meg Ryan remake of The Women, in lieu of which this film was made, being half as much fun.
1169	0	a	Anyone can relate to those moments when the calm is broken by the undercurrents of anguish, disappointment and resentment that run through every family.
1170	7	a	The worst thing? It's all hysterical and histrionic, and yet completely dull. I'm not certain how one manages that.
1171	4	a	Despite all these reservations, many children will enjoy this picture, and it's the best-crafted, most entertaining Hollywood product of a very bad week.
1172	10	a	A farce of a parody of a comedy of a premise, it isn't a comparison to reality so much as it is a commentary about our knowledge of films.
1173	3	a	...sharp, bleak, and oddly oblique...
1174	6	a	It's not just that the clean, efficient lines of Carver's story are blurred and tangled. The real flaw is that the movie's best features -- the aching clarity of its central performances - threaten to be lost in a wilderness of metaphor and mystification.
1175	2	a	An exceptional adventure story from one of the founding fathers of Australia's modern cinema.
1176	4	a	Equal parts awful and hypnotic
1177	5	a	we get a whole season's worth of sitcom in an less than two hours, whether or not this is a good thing is a quandary.
1178	4	a	Liam Neeson, clearly having trouble stepping back from action-thriller mode, isn't brilliant as Felt.
1179	4	a	Extremely violent, and powerful; for mature teens.
1180	3	a	Impressively directed, sharply written and beautifully shot, this is a powerfully emotional drama with terrific performances from Harris, Farrell and Sturgess.
1181	3	a	If [Bale's] performance doesn't prove to be one of the year's best, we're in for a very good year indeed.
1182	2	a	Love, Rosie is quaint comfort-cinema that makes for an amiable watch.
1183	3	a	Political junkies have long been wondering if there would be an October surprise... Now we know the answer. Team America: World Police is that surprise. 
1184	8	a	This movie is a cross between the Mad Slasher and Dead teenager genres; about two dozen movies a year feature a mad killer going berserk, and they're all about as bad as this one.
1185	4	a	A cinematic safe space for conservatives to escape the tidal wave of indictment/impeachment news they have a hard time avoiding on TV. 
1186	9	a	An epic in China, it's been trimmed here in the States. But this movie didn't need a cut, it needed a beheading.
1187	6	a	To enjoy this film, it helps to check your brain at the box office.
1188	3	a	It's almost impossible not to be moved by Jim Caviezel's vulnerability as Christ, even if the idea that he is no 'mere' man is never in doubt.
1189	2	a	Thanks to Crowe's steady hand and a talented, likeable cast, it is an appealing and family-friendly confection.
1190	6	a	A good cast tries to rescue a bad script.
1191	6	a	has as much acidic bite as a marshmallow sundae. ...It beats a drum, turns on a neon sign, demands your attention and then forgets what it wanted to say in the first place.
1192	3	a	Lovely, austere. And bloodless.
1193	3	a	It's a romantic and tough look at love, grief and choices - wonderfully acted and presented.
1194	4	a	Yeah, I know that it's something Snidely Whiplash or Wile E. Coyote would think up, but you knew what you were getting into when you decided to see this thing.
1195	2	a	The toy animals are well-conceived-very simple and stuffed toy-ish, and yet they convey the innocence of that age where a child's powerful imagination can easily create worlds populated by heffalumps, and such. 
1196	6	a	This movie assembles all the indie-film-of-the-Nineties cliches: brainless criminals, a bad plan, lots of dialogue, and Christopher Walken.
1197	4	a	Even though it takes too long to make some of its points, Bicentennial Man boasts thought-provoking ideas about the nature of humanity, the blessings and curses of emotions and the meaning of mortality.
1198	2	a	...a slightly steamy, highly romanticized period melodrama with real movie stars and a commensurate costume budget.
1199	4	a	Follows a rather predictable, well-worn path, but the sheer joy of performing on the actors' parts sells the film as a whole.
1200	5	a	Barnyard is nothing so much as The Lion King chewed in a cud and digitally regurgitated. It's manic and maudlin, borderline creepy, occasionally inspired.
1201	1	a	A sci-fi/western blend that does its progenitor proud.
1202	4	a	It's a nicely observed film, rich in period and mood, and lifted by one really superb performance, by young Chalamet.
1203	2	a	Not the best movie of the summer, but it may the best accompaniment to popcorn.
1204	2	a	Another reliable performance by Cynthia Nixon.
1205	0	a	Citizen Kane has been cited as the greatest film ever made from so many different quarters, it's a wonder that a Congressional law hasn't been passed making it required viewing for anyone who claims they like movies.
1206	5	a	Talk about your fixer-upper - the script needs fixer-uppering.
1207	5	a	It would be far too easy to say that max pain sums up Mark Wahlberg's latest lead role.
1208	5	a	It's a deadly bore.
1209	5	a	I can't wait to see if the sequel has them going to Russia to stop prostitute trafficking or perhaps back in time to Chicago to stop liquor smuggling during prohibition.
1210	4	a	After a few initial missteps, Cranston's good-natured character can do no wrong, and The Infiltrator takes cues from his progression by creating the sense that his scheme is so perfectly realized it can just glide along to a perfect finish.
1211	5	a	There are far better ways of keeping the kids happy.
1212	3	a	Powerful stuff. Almost certain to convert its audience from passive observer to People Who Give a Damn.
1213	2	a	Eastwood effectively taps into a well of our common feelings -- fear of death, the numbing shock of being aware of our mortality, and, most largely, the desperate need for closure.
1214	2	a	An affectionate, riotously funny parody that freely takes jabs at various elements of its subject but never seems mean-spirited or malintentioned.
1215	4	a	Those looking for a story equal to Cranston's contributions to it are liable to come away from it feeling slightly disappointed.
1216	3	a	... a coming-of-age, romantic, black comedy about time traveling, has an undeniable charm that's hard to properly describe.
1217	2	a	Not a typical, formulaic, feel-good romantic-comedy...Plays a bit like Best Friends for a younger generation.
1218	3	a	Wright directs with typical energy and effectively papers over an absence of plot.
1219	3	a	This is Angelina Jolie's movie all the way, and she does not disappoint.
1220	1	a	One of the most quietly powerful studies of the gradual and inevitable erosion of the family in a rapidly changing world.
1221	3	a	...a somewhat erratic drama that nevertheless packs a punch at several key moments.
1222	0	a	... I was pleasantly surprised.
1223	4	a	All emotional shortcuts and vaguely defined characters, held together more than it deserves by [Matt] Damon's admirable star turn.
1224	6	a	Hoffman and Streisand provide some laughs in this sequel to Meet the Parents but the screenplay lacks comic zest.
1225	4	a	Spielberg's first big drama is often hokey in places but ultimately succeeds.
1226	5	a	As its title suggests, this is pretty much the last throw of the dice for a dance saga that more ran out of juice a couple of sequels ago. The set-pieces, though, still deliver the requisite pizzazz.
1227	1	a	Darkly humorous and visually inventive, Burton's second film, which deservedly won the Makeup Oscar, fulfilled the promise he showed in his debut, launching a brilliant career with Batman and other original movies, many of which starring Johnny Depp.
1228	9	a	Doesn't bode well for Cook's movie career, and it's just another in a line of feature comedies that wouldn't cut it even as television sitcoms.
1229	0	a	Turing's optimism in the face of the seemingly impossible wins our affection and sympathy, making his ultimate fate all the more heartbreaking.
1230	1	a	A tale so complex, so absorbing, and so cerebrally titillating, you won't want to look away for two seconds for fear of missing something.
1231	2	a	The film works because of the world it creates, aided by the cinematography of Michael Chapman and the set design of frequent Coppola collaborator Dean Tavoularis.
1232	3	a	Now with Skyfall the sweet spot is back; the movie unspools as a thrilling action flick packed with witty little touches that Bond fans will recognize as big, fat valentines to the franchise's past.
1233	3	a	One of the more daring, intense and hypnotic Bible films ever made.
1234	6	a	Metza-metza. The FF is just not that fantastic t'all...
1235	5	a	While Thomas fans will regret seeing their literary hero reduced to a generic drunk, even those awaiting the aforementioned bathtub scene will find it barely worth the effort.
1236	2	a	Genuinely hilarious
1237	6	a	After a while, I was hoping for something besides more of the same old gore. The zombie genre isn't dead yet, but it's starting to look a little stiff.
1238	6	a	What 'The Angry Birds Movie is about is better than how it's about it.
1239	3	a	"John Carter"" enthusiastically remains a pulp story at heart."
1240	6	a	It's a strange, shapeless, rarely satisfying, but generally amiable movie in which everyone appears to be faking it as they go along, and almost -- almost -- getting away with it.
1241	4	a	It's a ridiculous, paradox-packed, sci-fi/action contrivance...but I'd be lying if I said I didn't get some guilty pleasure out of this inflated adventure.
1242	3	a	Land of the Dead is worth the wait, and dispels any fanboy concerns that the director was gone because he lost his mojo.
1243	6	a	Superior to the majority of the yawn-inducing suspensers out there these days.
1244	3	a	May not be in the same class as The Spy Who Came In from the Cold or The Constant Gardener, but it earns its keep by featuring yet another excellent turn by the late, lamented Philip Seymour Hoffman.
1245	5	a	Will small children even care about what bees do? All they care about is not getting stung.
1246	3	a	Stagey, but pleasant star vehicle
1247	4	a	Everybody's favourite multi-jawed dreadlocked alien monster is back for a fun, throwaway action splurge. With a large dollop of humour, the film plays like the latest sequel in the Predator series rather than as any attempt to makeover the formula.
1248	9	a	A confusing tale of love that will have you questioning your love of film making.
1249	6	a	I did a lot of squirming with this one.
1250	6	a	A good example of the now-neglected caper genre.
1251	3	a	A Most Wanted Man is a smart, gripping thriller that carefully navigates its way through subtle twists and delicious ambiguity.
1252	3	a	Tall, big-boned Janet McTeer ... is the ideal actress to play Lily Penleric.
1253	4	a	Rings true in its treatment of how men and women differ in their treatment of love.
1254	4	a	A recommendable film, especially for those who like real stories about real criminals. [Full review in Spanish]
1255	2	a	Tons of genuine sci-fi fun thanks to the movie's sarcastic humour, well-drawn characters and action thrills that get started right off in a sensational prologue.
1256	5	a	Do you need to know anything more than the title?
1257	4	a	All told, either you get it or you don't.
1258	1	a	It's an exuberant, audacious love letter to spaghetti westerns, masquerading as a kiddie cartoon. And it delivers deliciously on both levels.
1259	3	a	Working with premier cinematographer Caleb Deschanel, Gibson effectively hurls us into Christ's living nightmare, creating a mesmerizing twilight zone that is creepy and utterly unforgettable.
1260	5	a	All of the strands are weak in their own ways, but the film at least would have had redemptive moments if it wasn't structured so badly.
1261	6	a	Christopher Robin is not a naked cash grab, just a prettily clothed one.
1262	0	a	The film is quite lengthy, but so brisk and busy at all times that it quite flies by.
1263	8	a	A tedious tale with perhaps the worst performance ever in a film by Lon Chaney, Jr. A fencepost has more charisma than Chaney as Count Alucard. Painfully slow and awkward. 
1264	4	a	The movie is about muscular speed and skill, and that's all it's about. Like its hero, it's blank by design.
1265	3	a	The stunning overall look -- which tips its ten-gallon hat at western classicists like John Ford and Sergio Leone while winking slyly at Salvador Dali -- qualifies as a work of art in its own right.
1266	6	a	Palo Alto marks one of those rare films that is so accurate in its portrayal of characters that the movie suffers for it.
1267	3	a	An eccentric and peculiarly gripping film from veteran director Paul Schrader.
1268	4	a	What's altogether surprising is its refusal to romanticise either of its troubled or flawed central characters.
1269	3	a	It'll likely become an instantaneous cult-classic for teenage girls -- it's Hailee Steinfeld's 'Clueless.' However, late-millennial high school girls are anything but clueless.
1270	6	a	Flight of the Phoenix is not only reductive but irrelevant too.
1271	2	a	If [Eastwood] were a more subtle director, it would be a great film; as it is, it's an extremely good one, anchored by the subtly devastating performances of Penn, Robbins and Bacon.
1272	3	a	Like so many things made in Japan, Sofia Coppola's new film is smaller and less costly than its standard American counterpart while at the same time superior in most important respects.
1273	1	a	Click for full review
1274	4	a	A wonderfully weird two hours.
1275	4	a	It's an over-familiar story and lacks tension.
1276	1	a	A sterling example of the new Australian noir.
1277	3	a	A vibrant and joyous new documentary.
1278	9	a	More tedious and ugly anime
1279	4	a	"Paris Can Wait"" isn't exactly a feast, but it's a snack worth having."
1280	0	a	... a universal story that conquers with empathy and delicacy as very few love stories have in the history of cinema. [Full review in Spanish]
1281	7	a	Even more so than with the other Lecter movies, this prequel you should plan on seeing after you've eaten dinner. Better yet, skip the movie altogether and have dessert.
1282	2	a	That he has become a lightning rod for adult anger is, however, something of a curiosity. Until you spend some time in his world, that is.
1283	4	a	Based on a true story or not, the maudlin tone of Evelyn makes this sugary movie hard to swallow.
1284	1	a	Holds back a bit compared to its more melodramatic predecessor. But these are small complaints about a movie containing a trio of truly extraordinary and moving performances from Blanchett, Mara and Paulson that place it among the year's best.
1285	3	a	This movie delivers agreeable performances and a charming, amusing story that offers little in the way of substance.
1286	5	a	In laying on all the outrageousness, Ice Cube sacrifices a key element to Friday's appeal: a surprising amount of heart.
1287	6	a	This boorishly irreverent superhero sendup is a fiasco, sustained only by its FX.
1288	5	a	The Joneses is a black comedy about stealth marketing made by a filmmaker who's evidently much too close to the subject to bite the hand that feeds him.
1289	3	a	I'd rather rot in a New Orleans jail than watch it again. And yet its epiphanies are outrageously sharp, it is beautifully shot by cinematographer Peter Zeitlinger and the ending is a joy.
1290	6	a	"There's good stuff, but it's the weakest of the ""Fast"" films."
1291	4	a	Napoleon Dynamite may be forcefully weird and intermittently humorous, and you might not know what the heck to make of it, but there's nothing shocking about its screenplay.
1292	9	a	Tilting his elegantly aquiline features downward while hoisting one eyebrow over a dark orb, curling his lips with Grinchian deliberation, he seems to be determined to kill people on the strength of his cologne alone.
1293	4	a	Sometimes director Werner Herzog - a master, for nearly four decades, at blending the bizarre and the mundane - does let you in on Cage's motives. But just as often, he delivers a life, and a world, of random mayhem.
1294	4	a	Diesel centres the magical mischief with his winning muscular charm, while priestly advisor Michael Caine adds a welcome touch of charismatic class.
1295	3	a	The title of the film is misleading. This is not a film about war. This is a movie about extermination.
1296	5	a	Cameron has gone from shaping the zeitgeist to spoonfeeding it
1297	1	a	Enchanted proves that a motion picture can be light and frothy and yet still be intelligent and emotionally rewarding. As unlikely as it may seem, this is one of the year's best and brightest films.
1298	5	a	For people who don't know the rules of cricket or concern themselves with the romantic problems of the upper class, Becoming Jane is far from a classic.
1299	3	a	For a story so fraught with potential landmines, Sean Penn, the screenwriter, bridges delicate narrative constraints to fulfill expectations of audiences familiar with Krakauer's book.
1300	5	a	There are a few entertaining and amusing moments to be had with this film, but overall it's a messy and overlong attempt at recapturing what made the franchise fun in the first place.
1301	5	a	One of those mediocre computer-animated kidflicks that seem to come along every couple of weeks nowadays...desperately needs more imagination, charm and heart.
1302	0	a	A deliriously funny and disarmingly poignant love story that's sure to brighten the outlook of even the hardest cynic.
1303	0	a	Deliriously alive on screen, with an energy that's often electrifying, it's a movie that in its best moments recalls Scorsese's gangster classic GoodFellas, with a bit of Paul Thomas Anderson's Boogie Nights thrown in to sweeten the pot.
1304	0	a	While the average chicken may hold as much interest to you as a dead duck, this film's chickens are well-defined characters that make you laugh, feel worry for them, and then laugh even more.
1305	6	a	The dinosaurs are back again, but this time without Steven Spielberg at the helm...and it shows.
1306	8	a	After directing the pedestrian Cold Creek Manor, Mike Figgis may decide that Leaving Las Vegas wouldn't be nearly as productive as his Leaving Show Business.
1307	3	a	David Oyelowo is magnetic in his quiet, still performance and for those unfamiliar with these events, DuVernay's film is quite an education - it's also one historical drama with a very contemporary and real message.
1308	3	a	Spielberg seems to have resigned himself to the fact that he'll never match the impact of the radio show, but he's making no bones about going after that FX Oscar.
1309	0	a	[Blake] creates moments ... that are impossible to forget.
1310	3	a	This is a film with the scope and reach of almost a century but its power comes from the smallest gestures and the simplest moments.
1311	3	a	BATTLE ROYALE is a film that should not be easily ignored, and will not be easily forgotten...the faces of those kids are likely to linger long after the credits stop.
1312	1	a	The names pile up, the narrative becomes harder to untangle, and it all feeds into an atmosphere that mixes dread and wistfulness.
1313	5	a	Hokey doesn't even begin to describe it.
1314	9	a	I think my SAT score is too high to appreciate this movie.
1315	1	a	I had a heck of a time...I guarantee that money spent here is money spent wisely.
1316	6	a	Its uneven comedy may leave moviegoers yearning for the confidently choreographed banter and moral sludge that marked LaBute's previous outings.
1317	4	a	As a movie, it feels incomplete - yes, it's incredibly intense and powerful, but I wanted to see a little more about the compassionate man and a little less bloodshed.
1318	9	a	professes to be an honest depiction of ancient Roman excesses, but it succeeds only in being alternately boring and offensive
1319	4	a	"An amusing picture, but only for an hour, with the second half of ""Ralph Breaks the Internet"" spinning out of control as the creative team tries to find a way out of a cynical, brand-heavy setting. "
1320	5	a	Boozing, cheating, weeping, backstabbing, pill-popping -- Country Strong plays more like a honky-tonk jukebox than a movie. 
1321	2	a	A robot must protect itself as long as such protection does not conflict with the First or Second Law, the Law of Thermodynamics, the Law of the Jungle, or Law and Order: SVU.
1322	9	a	There's a point at which someone who is an expert in something can go from teacher to pedant. 
1323	4	a	Although the film is longer than the television and video segments children this age are accustomed to, the pacing is brisk enough to hold them.
1324	3	a	The armageddon-through-beer-goggles approach brings the chuckles, but The World's End stands up as a great example of the genre it ribs.
1325	5	a	Directors Glenn Ficarra and John Requa move things along fast enough to keep [the problem aspects] from sinking in too deeply, and star Tina Fey holds the spotlight with aplomb.
1326	5	a	For a man who mocks pop culture so well he can barely pull of the most American of pop culture, the western.
1327	3	a	In terms of logistics and overall filmmaking, this is a quantum leap over anything the team has previously attempted.
1328	2	a	Clement channels his wry hangdog humor into a slightly more grounded performance than he often gives. His charm and absurdist tendencies help elevate Nate from a potentially self-centered man-child to a lost soul who is genuinely compelling.
1329	3	a	Although not a true classic, The Quiet Man is worth more than a cursory glance, especially for those who like Wayne or would like to experience more of his work.
1330	5	a	"If you're working for The New Yorker, the legality of Laura Elena Harring's breasts is not an appropriate pitch for your ""Annals of Law"" column."
1331	4	a	The drama effectively combines combat and potboiler courtroom drama.
1332	3	a	Hardball is not some warm-fuzzy Bad News Bears clone transplanted to the projects. It's considerably better than that.
1333	1	a	Believe it or not, amidst all of the oversized collars and outlandish suits, [Russell] wrings pathos out of [his characters].
1334	0	a	One can picture Kubrick handling this material with a similar elegant malevolence.
1335	5	a	The dialogue is ridiculous and condescending.
1336	3	a	Affecting and dangerously close to home.
1337	3	a	Whiskey Tango Foxtrot is a tall glass of dark comedy mixed with serious drama, a drink far more delicious than trailers lead one to believe.
1338	2	a	The subplot is the basic difference between men and women, how they handle relationships, and how they handle crises. Probably not a film for everyone, but I enjoyed it.
1339	5	a	The result is a movie that has the dramatic tension of a luxury catalog spread, and the look of one, too.
1340	3	a	Bee Movie is fun, if not formulaic in its humor and story approach. The writers threw in every ... bee joke and situation you could think of, yet the movie still works.
1341	0	a	Five-star movie could scare the pants off kids.
1342	3	a	As cop movies go, Miami Vice does interesting things with unoriginal material.
1343	1	a	From a craft standpoint, Vertigo represents the director in peak form.
1344	4	a	Christopher Robin is beautifully shot and well-acted. I found the narrative drive of the script less than compelling, but it will certainly entertain parents and kids who already have a love of these time-tested characters.
1345	1	a	"Is ""The Artist"" a screwball comedy? A sentimental melodrama? A spoof? Serious? What? Yes, yes, yes and yes."
1346	4	a	Blame the script, which fails to fill out exactly how conflicted these characters are.
1347	2	a	I trust Jackson's instincts with Tolkien's work. It's his editorial indifference that could pose a greater threat to The Hobbit than any attack from Smaug.
1348	2	a	Clint Eastwood brings his usual late-career leisureliness behind the camera to the movie, in an initially frustrating approach that becomes increasingly satisfying as the film moves along.
1349	6	a	Kasdan's film lacks the spirit of Tyler's novel; he seems to be the wrong director to translate the author's affectionate and humorous treatment of the characters. Fortunately, Geena Davis as the eccentric dog-walker elevates the otherwise morose mood.
1350	2	a	The picture fires on all pistons.
1351	2	a	Despite the insistent prurience in the writing, the performances are pro and much production value is accomplished on a modest budget.
1352	1	a	How can a movie be simultaneously profane and sweet?
1353	3	a	What really matters is the affectionate, humanist perspective from which the filmmaker dramatizes the plight of a man who simply can't bare the weight of his job.
1354	4	a	Not as funny as the first, but has its moments
1355	10	a	Destined to please only bad movie buffs desperate for a fix of awful dialogue, blatant product placement, and clunky exposition.
1356	3	a	A balanced, insightful portrait of the provocative hip-hop icon.
1357	2	a	Forte is a surprising fount of melancholy and frustrated ambition, while Dern takes a tough part -- a man of few words who might not be all there -- and masterfully controls his body to convey Woody's inner depths.
1358	4	a	That Coppola finds occasional grace and spirit here shows understanding and compassion. Her next assignment? Make a movie that's not about the troubles of the privileged and bored.
1359	5	a	This feels like the high school skit that the principal would not let the kids do on talent night.
1360	3	a	"Film Stars Don't Die in Liverpool"" contains performances bigger than the film itself, but the movie is also a solid take on the waning years of an aging Hollywood film siren."
1361	0	a	Just as I couldn't stop turning the pages of Larsson's novel, I couldn't take my eyes off Fincher's movie. 
1362	3	a	...the performances and the genuinely interesting script make this one worth checking out.
1363	0	a	One of Spielberg's best films, yet seldom shown.
1364	5	a	Yet another goofy credit in Gere's already overloaded resume of embarrassment -- although some may consider this one of those movies that's so silly it's good.
1365	6	a	A turgid melodrama that's as painfully strung out as the events themselves.
1366	10	a	An abysmal, painfully unfunny comedy.
1367	3	a	Retains the Coen brothers' trademark quirkiness, and it certainly goes all out. But it's also subtle in ways we haven't seen before.
1368	1	a	While its strange rhythms may not be for everyone, it does provide something unusual in today's movies: a truly original experience for the mind and the soul.
1369	4	a	Conjures an unsettling aura but does so at a deliberate tempo where its characters' emotional journey and insular world takes precedence over predictable genre tactics.
1370	0	a	Bleak but beautiful, and with characteristic Coen shafts of gallows humor,...about as perfect as a film can get...a shocking and mesmerizing experience.
1371	5	a	The rest of the movie, sadly, can't live up to its leads.
1372	2	a	Subtly stirring and sensitive drama - about a sensuous summer that could change the course of a boy's life.
1373	1	a	Brainy, intelligent, emotional filmmaking that just happens to be in the thriller genre.
1374	6	a	While the two leads are likable enough, they deserve better, especially McCarthy. Her range is criminally misused here -- it's almost as if someone stole her comedic identity and committed a bad film in her name.
1375	6	a	It's a little too brief to get bored exactly, but it's certainly long enough to get frustrated at the lack of the essential ingredients to get the audience engaged in its story.
1376	5	a	McGregor's performance has sincerity of a frowningly oppressive kind, but the whole thing is tinged with self-pity.
1377	3	a	The movie becomes - unexpectedly, and unhappily for those looking for another generational anthem - a rueful song about failure.
1378	6	a	Unfortunately, there's a limit to the effectiveness of this kind of influence.
1379	4	a	Lives are messy. A little mess in the movie wouldn't have hurt at all.
1380	5	a	"Ugly and miserable in the most generic way possible, amusing only in flashes, usually because of Eckhart's ""kids roleplaying in the backyard"" performance style."
1381	5	a	It's a seriously withholding action comedy, stingy on the wit, charm, jokes, narrative satisfactions and animals with personalities sharp enough for the big screen.
1382	0	a	The film comes off as inventive and enlivening, even as it makes clear how destructive heroin is.
1383	4	a	In places it has the airless feel of an over-workshopped piece, but is rescued by excellent performances: in particular Amy Ryan as Connie, Jack's shy would-be girlfriend.
1384	3	a	Martin McDonagh has crafted a magnificently rich story filled with complexities and twisting turns - it's an experiential kaleidoscope.
1385	4	a	To see Osment react to a door closing is akin to watching someone get defibrillated.
1386	5	a	While it has been made with just enough style to arguably make it the best of the series to date, that still doesn't make it good by any stretch of the imagination 
1387	6	a	Look at it this way; it could be worse. Your kids could be hooked on Barney.
1388	4	a	Entertaining enough, but unmistakably the work of a later, lesser era.
1389	3	a	"Sylvester Stallone's gun-emptying, blade-tossing, clandestine action flick ""The Expendables"" is great fun. Sure, this declaration comes with caveats, but do you really need to hear them?"
1390	5	a	MacFarlane's leading man career begins and ends with this
1391	9	a	Noisy claptrap devoid of all that is good about cinema.
1392	3	a	There's an awful lot to enjoy here, even if you're not a hardcore Smith fan.
1393	3	a	This crime-oriented portrait of characters snared by their environment leads to an excruciatingly powerful buildup, before it surrenders to contrivance in its final act.
1394	6	a	Nothing about this film is as cathartic as it tries to make itself because the characters just aren't that absorbing. Instead of tugging your heart, it just spits in your eye.
1395	6	a	Larsson has whipped up something unique - Agatha Christie with techno Goths - yet this is unremarkable. If anything, the mixing of elements feels clumsy.
1396	5	a	With its hints of a greater intelligence lurking somewhere, The Ring makes its stupidity more than obvious. It's painful.
1397	4	a	Bryan Cranston, playing Bob, carries the movie, at home in guises from bowling alley sleazebag to slick mafioso accountant, and sympathetic throughout.
1398	3	a	It's hard to tell if super-fans of the original Predator will find this to be a suitable relaunch, but there are certainly enough entertaining elements to keep even the most casual fan invested.
1399	3	a	Eminem's performance as the struggling actor is very impressive.
1400	3	a	The most fun you'll have in theaters this summer
1401	1	a	As an emotional rumination on death and its aftermath, it is gripping.
1402	1	a	It's a familiar show-biz routine but one that's spangled with happy surprises and sharp acting.
1403	4	a	Boseman's performance nearly makes up for the movie.
1404	3	a	A well-written, solidly acted love story.
1405	0	a	Graced with a particular genius for absorbing the past to suggest an exciting cinematic future.
1406	6	a	A political thriller about President Kennedy's most successful moments of his flawed presidency...
1407	6	a	It yawningly snaps into place as yet another series of explosions that are dressed up with no place to blow.
1408	9	a	One of the most inane entries in a genre already piled sky-high with inane entries.
1409	0	a	The movie is just plain fun.
1410	3	a	Solid, if melodramatic...
1411	4	a	It's really bad, but the soundtrack cannot be denied. It alone bumps it up a few points.
1412	4	a	Tries so hard to be quirky and loveable that it hurts to watch.
1413	6	a	Offers is the opportunity for a bunch of actors, many of them tethered to TV series, to deliver theatrical monologues pulsing with misogyny and narcissism. It's like second-rate Neil Labute.
1414	4	a	A warm drama of mentorship and coming-of-age whose low-level tribulations are smartly counterbalanced by some fine acting and direction.
1415	4	a	Keeping this series of black-comedy skits fresh is a challenge that the writers don't always meet, and their expository scenes need to be nail-gunned.
1416	3	a	As a film, Selma is solid if unspectacular. As a dramatic portrayal of recent U.S. history, however, Selma burns with a fierce intensity.
1417	4	a	... frustratingly humorless, harsh, and hollow, lacking the cohesiveness, color and convincing characterization of Eastwood's masterpiece Unforgiven.
1418	5	a	These characters exist in a bubble of happy-go-lucky romance and inevitable tragedy.
1419	1	a	A shattering piece of filmmaking that successfully ties the suspense of a real-time crime with the tragedy of a larger social ill. It will make you feel something. 
1420	4	a	Most of the side characters feel badly underwritten, although the gifted cast makes the most of them.
1421	4	a	It's charming.
1422	3	a	Shockingly sexual, brilliantly acted, and overall strangely appealing
1423	9	a	"Except for a handful of misplaced laughs, ""Revolutionary Road"" is nothing but loud arguments, awkward silences and other bits of unpleasantness."
1424	3	a	Aardman Animations gives viewers what we didn't know we needed: a football origin story. Early Man is eccentrically funny and mostly warm-hearted.
1425	4	a	This film would've worked really well as a short film, it's not terribly satisfying as a full length feature.
1426	4	a	Some of the dialogue is witty and surprisingly poignant.
1427	3	a	Existential, inventive and irreverent
1428	3	a	A great actor should not seem, but be. Mirren simply is, and she takes Hitchcock up a notch with every look and line.
1429	4	a	"Still Alice"" is hampered by both an unimaginative script and ordinary direction, but it's a serious Oscar contender. Why? Because Julianne Moore is in the lead."
1430	0	a	The reason it's so troubling, even disturbing, is that notwithstanding the protagonist's profound goodness, the film insists on consequences for his narcissism, his naivete, his -- yes -- stupidity.
1431	3	a	Charlize Theron's performance as a serial killer is a masterpiece, even if the movie itself falls short.
1432	3	a	where Taxi Driver sees the fallacy in canonizing Travis Bickle, Fight Club does it without irony.
1433	5	a	This may be the first screen romance in recent memory where the inclusion of ABBA lyrics might have actually come across as an improvement.
1434	2	a	Cleverly written and performed, it's entertaining but uneven.
1435	0	a	"Selma"" is one of the best American films of the year - and indeed perhaps the best - precisely because it does not simply show what Dr. King did for America in his day; it also wonders explicitly what we have left undone for America in ours."
1436	0	a	Elio and Oliver's relationship has an authentic tenderness under the direction of Luca Guadagnino, who's created the best coming-of-age story in recent years.
1437	1	a	The best antidote I can think of to the constant bombardment of self-serious Leftist documentaries is a movie that slams everyone, no matter what the affiliation.
1438	4	a	The long, long in development film adaptation of the classic video game shooter, Doom is a decent enough action film as long as you don't expect too much out of it.
1439	4	a	What's strange about The Break-Up is that, despite the alleged deep love between Gary and Brooke, you never get the sense that much is at stake.
1440	6	a	[It] may be the launch of a new franchise or not, but stories about teens struggling to make sense of the world they find themselves in will continue to find an audience. 
1441	2	a	The Edge of Seventeen isn't John Hughes for a new generation - it's much more honest than that.
1442	3	a	It is not art, but it is fun.
1443	0	a	A must-see not only for the crucial tale it tells, but also as a wildly enjoyable, passionate and poignant piece of cinema.
1444	6	a	Space Jam is harmless kiddie fare, but it may not be every adult's idea of a good time.
1445	1	a	To my surprise, a diamond has emerged from the gutter. Its name is The World's End, and it'll knock you on you ass from laughing when you're not rubbing your eyes in disbelief. 
1446	4	a	Lighter and looser than Another Earth, but the script still strains.
1447	4	a	"It would be wrong to ignore the technical achievement that Jackson has pulled off yet again. But when said and done, ""The Hobbit"" feels more like a cinematic encyclopedia of Tolkein's mythical world rather than a trip to the movies."
1448	4	a	Aside from its blatantly commercial aspirations and predictable storyline, there is an appealing cast, enjoyable songs and some funny bits of business.
1449	9	a	We Bought a Zoo is so filled with artificial sweetener that it may cause cancer.
1450	6	a	Hell of a nice try, but I've seen it all before.
1451	0	a	"Revealing too much of the narrative would spoil the pleasure of learning where Matteo and Nicola find themselves. ""Youth"" sells us on the idea that life is a gift and that beauty and rejuvenation can come from even seemingly unbearable lows."
1452	2	a	In terms of immediate emotional impact, The Curious Case of Benjamin Button is extremely satisfying.
1453	2	a	Dench gives a superb performance as a simple, trusting woman of faith.
1454	6	a	The situations in this sitcom never get as funny as they should. 
1455	5	a	Shanghai Noon, which lacks Rush Hour's manic energy, also lacks confidence in its own much bigger, potentially fascinating story.
1456	3	a	Yes, a lot of these elements can be universal, but it seems undeniable to me that a gay audience will bring something altogether unique to their viewing of such a film.
1457	6	a	Spike Lee brings way too much baggage for the movie to work. 
1458	5	a	Oscillates between the jolting and the absurd, bottoming out with a nonsensical coda ...
1459	9	a	It patronizes us with caricatures for characters. 
1460	3	a	Excellent drama containing one of Tony Curtis' greatest performances.
1461	0	a	It's like a bloody Renaissance painting come to life. But the DVD is a disappointment.
1462	2	a	Masterfully constructed and yet eventually rather wearisome.
1463	2	a	An unclassified film that swings between genres like western, noir, melodrama, dark comedy and inspiring tale. [Full review in Spanish]
1464	7	a	Arguably Van Sant's weakest film, this adaptation of Tom Robbins's feminist anarchic manifesto is poorly conceived, directed, and acted.
1465	0	a	In Selma, British actor David Oyelowo subtly transmogrifies himself into Martin Luther King Jr, displaying intelligent self-doubt, not flash political pomp.
1466	0	a	The film's last-minute twist is strictly spoiler territory, so all I'll say is that Call Me by Your Name is that rare achievement: a great film that only gets greater as it unfolds.
1467	3	a	Solid, unsurprising, formalist filmmaking of the kind we've come to expect from Clint Eastwood.
1468	1	a	The film is emotionally charged, almost naturally so, with Hanson's direction stressing the pop rapture that music can provide in a world that's dirty and ugly.
1469	4	a	For the better part of the journey this a bizarrely uplifting yarn - razor sharp, you might say.
1470	3	a	Ralph Breaks the Internet is more emotive than the original despite its flaws. [Full Review in Spanish]
1471	2	a	The Man Without a Past earns amusing comic points without seeming to strain for them.
1472	2	a	For a movie about an ape, it sheds an interesting light on humanity. Animals may be wild, but only humans are cruel.
1473	6	a	Peter Bogdanovich brings conviction but little else to this upbeat response to Robert Altman's Nashville.
1474	3	a	Even while struggling to make sense of the movie's frequent obscurities, it's impossible not to be moved by the intensity of Tarkovsky's vision.
1475	3	a	After struggling interminably to bring the first of the obscenely popular Harry Potter novels to the screen, director Chris Columbus finally cracks the code with his second effort.
1476	1	a	By taking us inside King's inner circle, we discover how courage, conviction and political savvy bring about change.
1477	2	a	There are certain productions that wear a broad smile and carry little personality, with director Michel Hazanavicius's valentine to moviemaking days of yore perfectly, utterly, monumentally...fine. 
1478	3	a	Like the Thomas Pynchon novel on which it's based, Inherent Vice is an anti-thriller, a loose, lunatic, sun-scorched noir that just keeps piling on the madness.
1479	5	a	As forgettable as a Hollywood couple's marriage vows.
1480	4	a	Mr. Neeson's performance is matched by the finely detailed look and feel of Mr. Jordan's direction, and the melancholy Dublin he has re-created.
1481	3	a	Clint Eastwood scores again with this tale of Mandela and his idea to bring unity to South Africa through rugby. Morgan Freeman and Matt Damon provide the acting clout while Eastwood shapes the direction of the film.
1482	3	a	You will be consumed watching the movie.
1483	6	a	Despite the film's predictability, there's something in the film that makes you want to root for the bad guy.
1484	5	a	"Love the Hard Way"" looks low budget and any box office will be made from those interested in seeing Brody in his post ""Pianist"" role..."
1485	3	a	Powerful story for mid-teens and up.
1486	3	a	It might not feel fresh but Palo Alto feels real, honest and moving. An impressive debut by an exciting new talent.
1487	9	a	It's long, sloppy, and -- to both the quantum-physics ignorant and informed -- steadily implausible, never exciting in either its skill or its ludicrousness.
1488	2	a	Lisa Kudrow interview: Following her 'Friends' fame, you now get the sense that she's splitting her time between TV work, various films and perhaps most important mothering. Work on 'Bandslam' is now much like real life for her.
1489	3	a	There's always another fight, just as there's always another boxing film.
1490	9	a	Low rent from frame one.
1491	10	a	Dull, humorless slasher flick.
1492	4	a	Filled with gorgeous images, expertly assembled and perfectly set to music. But for the most part, it's all completely superfluous
1493	4	a	"Judicious editing could have helped consolidate the joyfulness at the expense of occasionally repetitive narrative flab, but for the most part ""Matru"" is neatly energetic, a mix of screwball whimsy and softball seriousness."
1494	1	a	An assured bonbon of a film that's thoroughly and deliciously entertaining.
1495	4	a	It's a professional old-school espionage outing, intricate as clockwork and acted with relish by the ever-watchable Hoffman.
1496	0	a	Here is one of the more pointed and thoughtful discoveries of the year.
1497	3	a	Fey gives an impressively sensitive dramatic performance.
1498	3	a	Assembled with style.
1499	3	a	But for those who play along with del Toro's methods, Crimson Peak is a beautifully horrifying experience.
1500	4	a	There's no end to the schmaltz in Winnie the Pooh's honey pot, yet Disney's live-action Christopher Robin also tosses in enough charm and tomfoolery for a sufficiently delightful hang with the iconic bear.
1501	3	a	A dazzler -- and almost as exciting as its title promises.
1502	6	a	...nothing more than a showcase for Close's admittedly stirring performance...
1503	3	a	Soderbergh has returned in top form to prescribe an entertaining and very enjoyable exhibition of himself. [Full review in Spanish] 
1504	2	a	Killer Joe pitches to the rafters, amping up a hicksploitation thriller with unnecessary jolts of savage violence and abuse.
1505	3	a	If you can grin and bear [certain] eye-rolling situations...there's found poetry in Nebraska's slow builds of respect and its deeply understated emotional climax: a father and son crossing past each other as they switch places.
1506	3	a	Their ongoing one-upmanship is awkward, juvenile, and not especially funny, yet underscored by so much honest pain you understand -- if not condone -- Gary and Brooke's desperate actions.
1507	1	a	Unlike so many comedies that rely on plastic characters based on no one from this universe, Apatow studies society and what truly makes us laugh -- which often turns out to be ourselves.
1508	9	a	Movies like Larry the Cable Guy: Health Inspector may be critic-proof, but even die-hard fans of country crude will have to admit that a little Larry goes a long way.
1509	6	a	We are left with a movie that raises more questions that it satisfactorily addresses.
1510	3	a	The deeply ironic undertones will keep adults and kids entertained alike.
1511	0	a	Cockamamie, kaleidoscopic, languidly compelling ...
1512	6	a	It's a checklist of summer-movie elements arranged with enough care to suggest that it should add up to more than a pleasant diversion.
1513	9	a	The performances are stilted for the most part, with most scenes feeling melodramatic when meant to be tragic, flat as a pancake when meant to be funny.
1514	4	a	If you haven't seen the target film, not only is it not funny, it becomes totally pointless.
1515	3	a	...a little bit whimsical, a little bit scary, and a whole lot of charming.
1516	3	a	Christopher Walken is tied to a chair most of the movie, and he's the center of attention. If that's not a selling point, you and I will never agree on anything.
1517	3	a	Although The Ring has horror picture elements, it is more of an intriguing mystery and detective story than a shocker.
1518	4	a	The boxing sequences are by-the-numbers, but Teller's performance is solid as he captures Vinny's overconfident bluster before the accident and his gutsy determination after.
1519	3	a	A landmark by an American master
1520	6	a	Any film that makes Rose Byrne unappealing has its head well and truly up its bum.
1521	9	a	"Levinson has gone from Wag the Dog to ""Screw the Pooch""."
1522	3	a	As a comedy, the feature isn't laugh-out-loud funny but the filmmakers seem to be aiming for a greater goal here: relevance.
1523	5	a	A formula family tearjerker told with a heavy Irish brogue...accentuating, rather than muting, the plot's saccharine thrust.
1524	9	a	like watching inertia become entropy, though even that description makes it sound more interesting than it is
1525	6	a	Russell is so enamored with the period pizzazz - the outrageous hairstyles and outfits, the strobe-lit clubs, the yellows and browns - that the movie flatlines.
1526	7	a	commits the crime of being totally and utterly tiresome.
1527	2	a	...like the value for pi, which has been calculated to one billion decimal places and counting, it does not fail to generate curiosity and speculation.
1528	0	a	Mendes and Deakins have] created the most beautifully deep focus context for Bond yet, pushing and pulling him into landscapes... that each promise the physically compromised spy nothing less than the most cinematically gorgeous sort of doom.
1529	0	a	The story is vintage McCarthy in its sense of place and its poetic voice. And it is vintage Coens for some of those same traits, and its cruel, graphic violence.
1530	5	a	The contrived plot somehow combines true love, drug smuggling, pirate treasure, and sharks into a paint-by-numbers exercise.
1531	4	a	Intense look at gender and relationships is best for adults.
1532	6	a	At least the audience I was with laughed more than it screamed.
1533	2	a	Aside from Turturro and Goodman, this movie is chockful of good performances.
1534	5	a	It ultimately fails because it lacks sufficient satire or an edge.
1535	4	a	Vinny's story is an inspiring one, and it's told with enough passion and punch to make up for its often overt familiarity.
1536	2	a	Utterly stupid yet completely memorable.
1537	6	a	Set in the sort of all-white suburbia that you rather hoped had disappeared years ago, Alethea Jones' comedy, written by Julie Rudd - both making their feature debut here - broadly goes where others have gone before.
1538	5	a	The worst kung fu movie since Sammo Hung's Heart of Dragon.
1539	5	a	Welcome Home Roscoe Jenkins reinforces the sense that movies are not about real life but about other movies.
1540	4	a	For better or for worse, How High knows what its audience wants and serves it to them, straight up, without any sort of moral or ethical chaser.
1541	6	a	Some of the lines are pretty clever, but you need to have a very keen and sticky tolerance for dogs making goo-goo eyes.
1542	3	a	It's dumb, dumb, dumb and crass, crass, crass -- but funny, funny, funny.
1543	3	a	Xtro has... some great attempts at atmosphere and an emotional core to the story and if you get with the general sense of escalating weirdness you'll have a good time.
1544	0	a	Be mentally strong, for you might become psychologically vulnerable from the mind-altering Trainspotting experience.
1545	2	a	"The Wedding Date"" is slight and it knows it. It has no pretentions. It's an odd little fairy tale about a single woman and her paid stud. Messing is a movie star."
1546	7	a	Michael Corrente loses his bearings, bringing nothing fresh, and everything bland.
1547	6	a	Wonderland never gives us a single reason to care about any of these people.
1548	2	a	a riveting military drama, a popcorn thriller masquerading as a political potboile
1549	5	a	It's meant to wear down and demoralize critics who are about to launch into a whole new year of worthless buddy comedies.
1550	0	a	Isn't it time that the ladies got their own rollicking, foul-mouthed, THC-soaked party movie? The fact that it contains a profoundly progressive message about the difficulties of bucking an inherently sexist system helps its instant-classic status. 
1551	5	a	The definition of 'rock' here seems to be winsome be-yourself ballads with a smattering of guitar.
1552	3	a	A brooding and intense journey into a graceless world, with Robert Pattinson delivering a fascinating, career defining performance in the process.
1553	6	a	"one of those irritatingly ""well-intentioned"" movies that constantly falls flat because it offers no depth"
1554	6	a	Brad Pitt spends a lifetime aging backward in The Curious Case of Benjamin Button, and there are points in the movie where your tired hindquarters feel as if they've been along for every minute of his strange journey.
1555	3	a	An absorbing portrait of one woman's interior landscape.
1556	3	a	Verbinski has made an animated feature unlike any other on the current mainstream landscape: For a big-budget animated picture, Rango sure is an odd little varmint.
1557	4	a	There's so little at stake here that nothing much matters except for a good time.
1558	2	a	"Early Man"" may not be the best of Aardman Animations but it is still a pleasure to watch from start to finish. It has its share of lovable characters, lots of humor and a big heart."
1559	4	a	Kimball's work is always appealing to the eye yet never too noticeable so as to draw attention away from the movie's plot.
1560	6	a	She only sort of does it.
1561	2	a	Enchanted hits every high note, and a great family film that entertains both the kids and adults is something we can all be truly thankful for.
1562	0	a	Wild, wondrous and utterly disarming ... sweet but never saccharine, freed from the shackles of postmodern irony and cleverness for its own sake.
1563	3	a	Its sombre sincerity and hypnotic, treasure-box beauty make Crimson Peak feel like a film out of time - but Del Toro, his cast and his crew carry it off without a single postmodern prod or smirk.
1564	6	a	It lures you in with a promise of being a smart, zeitgeist-y satire, but before it can deliver on that promise, it morphs into something more resembling a soap opera.
1565	5	a	A film steeped in the streetwise hip-hop culture should have an edge, but Battle of the Year is safer and softer than Drake's last album. 
1566	3	a	It reminded me how vibrantly original an honest-to-God independent film can be.
1567	5	a	Damon breathes some life in to this boring film, but he's only in one-third. 
1568	0	a	A defiantly weird and unexpectedly charming effort that could easily feel at home at both matinees and on the midnight movie circuit.
1569	4	a	It's the action sequences in this movie that sell.
1570	2	a	A large-scale investigation into religious hysteria, the film is a stunning spectacle, piloted by a filmmaker drawn to the frayed ends of human irrationality...There's some truly exhilarating filmmaking to devour here.
1571	4	a	It's very talky. It's pretentious. But I enjoyed it despite all of those things.
1572	5	a	The direction of the film is so matter-of-fact, the storytelling so obvious, the lack of nuance so palpable, that it seems to actually take its alarmist and patronising attitudes towards change at face value.
1573	3	a	For two decades, Julia Roberts has been a bona fide movie star, and she shines in his gorgeous if overlong travelogue.
1574	6	a	Martin Amis's brilliantly acerbic first novel is unpersuasively filmed as a trendy teen comedy, with its self-loathing intellectual hero transformed into a nerdy-but-lovable computer geek.
1575	6	a	Simpliflies complicated South African issues to the level of a Berenstain Bears storybook.
1576	5	a	It's conventional, dull and unconsciously nasty.
1577	2	a	Eminem proves capable of carrying the lead, at least when the material is tailored to fit. Rather than show great range in his first outing, he gives an effective slow burn.
1578	0	a	The Coens understand the stark immediacy of this tale, and they visualize it with brilliantly judged details.
1579	9	a	"I just love this guy,"" James says of Paul Blart in the movie's production notes. For the sake of humanity I hope and pray that barely anyone else shares his affection."
1580	1	a	I loved this sweet, gentle film, and prize its charms and heart far more than the debatable weightiness of Lee's Lust, Caution.
1581	1	a	Logan Lucky is a crackerjack heist film that strongly echoes Soderbergh's other crackerjack heist franchise, but with a uniquely downmarket and genuinely affectionate charm all its own.
1582	0	a	He's an underappreciated hero brought to life through Cumberbatch's brilliant performance. It may not be Turing-level brilliant, but it's not far off.
1583	2	a	Welcome To Mooseport, which resonates with a little light Frank Capra and a touch of Norman Rockwell Americana, is just good old-fashioned fun.
1584	1	a	Sends all the right messages to the youth audience it targets and also keeps the grownups entertained with that forgotten, pre-ironic innocent comedy that fades as we each discover sex.
1585	5	a	Elegaic where it should be electrifying, dundering where it should be sharp, Payne is lovely to look at and that's about it
1586	1	a	"Nicholas Cage gives his best performance since ""Leaving Los Vegas"" as con man Roy Waller in this sophisticated movie about familial responsibility, self-imposed barriers and the possibilities of a well executed long con."
1587	9	a	You'd have to put me in a lock box to see it again.
1588	1	a	I remember watching the opening scenes with an air of indifference, and I remember watching the climax very nearly in hysterics.
1589	0	a	It's as thrilling and lushly beautiful a movie as has been released all year, matched only by Zhang's epic Hero.
1590	2	a	It Comes at Night is a relentlessly bleak exercise in paranoia and distrust that taps into some of the deepest fears within the human condition.
1591	5	a	Antal's attempts to crank up the tension are telegraphed far too often and undermined by a flagrant disregard for logic, meaning this never delivers quite enough bang for your buck.
1592	4	a	A meta-satire that doesn't quite come off.
1593	6	a	And while it may not teach sprogs anything about insects - these ones have human eyes and four limbs - director Ben Stassen has made a fair fist of portraying the Apollo mission with some accuracy.
1594	5	a	Even McGregor's palpable sincerity cannot obscure the film's smug misogyny. 
1595	5	a	This dragon tale goes down in flames.
1596	3	a	You're left with the impression that, despite not being able to grasp basic human grammar, perhaps Nim was unwittingly conditioned into understanding the concept of love.
1597	3	a	"Charming prehistoric tribute to ""sacred game"" of soccer. "
1598	0	a	Vivid, nuanced and, yes, timely.
1599	5	a	Offers nothing new to the tropical vacation comedy ... not even the funniest bits from the commercials really stack up to much of the cast's weakest work to date.
1600	5	a	There's no denying Guy Pearce's talent, but The Rover is still a dog.
1601	3	a	Smarter and more original than most [Dead Teenager Movies].
1602	3	a	A small movie with a gigantic performance by Charlize Theron.
1603	1	a	Too rich, too intelligent, too deep and too accessible to ignore.
1604	5	a	"Early Man"" is lovingly crafted down to the smallest detail. But its story, a farcical tribute to the early origins of soccer, isn't nearly as sturdy as its presentation."
1605	5	a	It's all so dumbfounding it makes you wonder: Did Eastwood even, like, show up on set and direct this thing?
1606	1	a	A grand spectacle of a movie wrapped around intimate human drama.
1607	5	a	Offers yet more proof that performance capture is a terrible idea when it comes to making fully animated feature films.
1608	9	a	The dialogue's so putrid you can smell it, the cast is feeble and the generic sets and effects elicit more laughs than screams.
1609	6	a	Without Jane Fonda, there isn't much to talk about. Yet with her, the film is enjoyable to watch, not only because she is so appealing to look at but because she has such a flair for the role.
1610	6	a	This is a straight to video job.
1611	9	a	Darlings, there's nothing quite so tragique as a boring eccentric.
1612	5	a	It starts with a great story - of love and politics, time travel and mystical pathways between planets - badly sucked dry.
1613	1	a	An immaculately constructed Rube Goldberg device that accumulates comic energy and speed as it reaches its finale, built from social and emotional hypocrisies we use to try and paper over our vices. It's what Russell does now, only far less serious.
1614	6	a	A chaotic blur of a movie with only one discernible objective: to rev the idling engines of a mostly youthful audience.
1615	3	a	Talk to Me is more than enough fun as a showcase for Mr. Cheadle's wit and spontaneity and as an inside look at the airwaves' transition from warm and fuzzy comforter to the anything-goes entertainment of today.
1616	6	a	click to read the full review
1617	6	a	A disappointment from the director of Bloody Sunday.
1618	3	a	Exciting, emotionally layered and brimming with invention.
1619	9	a	Nonsensical, cheesy, saccharine drivel, with all the charm of the source material removed, and the low-tech special effects kept in.
1620	10	a	Has nothing of value to offer other than a dizzying number of cameos by former child stars, each of whom is only momentarily amusing as a voyeuristic opportunity to compare the grown-up on screen to the kid ever emblazoned upon our mind's eye.
1621	5	a	Skilled actors can't save derivative, violent YA thriller. 
1622	4	a	It's so accurate that it's barely parody.
1623	5	a	The movie doesn't weave religion into the familiar structure of a comedy or melodrama. Instead, everything works in service to the sermon at the core.
1624	4	a	"I Am David"" earns just about every teardrop it elicits. The journey isn't smooth, but that doesn't mean it isn't worthwhile."
1625	6	a	A film about putting people on is, at the end, unable to put us on.
1626	3	a	Good entertainment, but not a film that will stay on your mind once you've seen it.
1627	2	a	...manages - by virtue of its uncommon geniality - to convince us it's about genuine human beings.
1628	5	a	A rom-com short on romance and even shorter on laughs.
1629	5	a	Sadly, great performances do not a great film make.
1630	4	a	It's a melodrama that doesn't need grime to make it interesting or wrenching.
1631	5	a	Awkward and unamusing and ridiculous in the bad way.
1632	6	a	Is McGregor a bad director? Lord knows he's not the first to swing and whiff at Roth. I'll give him a mulligan here.
1633	3	a	Who knew male strippers could be so sweet?
1634	2	a	When you consider the films about real-life politicians we usually get, Chappaquiddick is surprisingly bold even if its modest approach belies its striking statements. 
1635	8	a	A base guy flick that's clueless about women, relationships and emotion, and even flirts with sacrilege.
1636	4	a	...an occasionally hilarious, frequently anemic parody that misses its opportunity to permanently document a scathing critique of current events.
1637	3	a	For what many may consider a dumb comedy, there is something surprisingly honest and heartfelt about what this film has to say about growing up and the friends that you keep
1638	3	a	Rapper Eminem's film debut is far better than you'd think -- and a pure demonstration of the power of charisma.
1639	4	a	Raunchy, funny, and not for younger kids.
1640	6	a	This is the first Almodovar movie that could be called boring.
1641	5	a	The film is based on a very small book of the same name that's illustrated with stick figures. Director Donald Petrie's film miraculously manages to be even less detailed.
1642	5	a	This is a join-the-dots yawn-fest of the laziest kind, ditching any serious attempt to get its teeth into the characters.
1643	5	a	The sole pleasure I got was in gazing at the fancy costumes and taking in the lush grounds of the snobby Lady Gresham's estate.
1644	4	a	"James White"" can be a chore to sit through, but it's never completely without merit."
1645	3	a	Two-and-a-half hours of unadulterated fun.
1646	6	a	a tedious...excuse for this director to indulge his fetish for digitalized blood and daggers and...immaculately composed nature shots
1647	1	a	M. Night Shyamalan could learn a thing or two from the Nolans when it comes to dramatic tension and payoff. A good story isn't just about the twist, it's about people.
1648	0	a	...an intensely cinematic psychological portrait of a man reckoning with the how and why of who he's become.
1649	4	a	An intelligent and deeply felt work about impossible, irrevocable choices and the price of making them.
1650	1	a	Sjostrom, in his final film, delivers one of the finest performances in any Bergman film -- a major accomplishment considering the virtuosity that Bergman's actors consistently display.
1651	0	a	Part heady romance, part coming-of-age tale, and one of the most beautiful recent examples of both.
1652	9	a	It's an interplanetary clunker.
1653	1	a	Lost in Translation offers such a wealth of wonderful themes that one hardly knows where to begin.
1654	1	a	The film features a number of superb acting performances, none more so than from Bruce Dern and June Squibb.
1655	4	a	Hey, it's February, a month when moviegoers have to be thankful for anything diverting.
1656	3	a	One of Norman Jewison's core themes of his career is the singular figure and how his or her's goals, desires, and actions affect the people around them.
1657	3	a	Neither sensationalistic nor sentimental, Ms. Berg's film is clear-sighted, tough-minded and devastating, a portrait of individual criminality and institutional indifference, a study in the betrayal of trust and the irresponsibility of authority.
1658	1	a	A frank, spare, but ultimately heartbreaking movie.
1659	1	a	Watching it now especially, it seems even more ahead of its time with it's altered-reality storyline.
1660	3	a	Heston delivers a rugged, compelling performance...
1661	4	a	Terrific dance sequences make up for subpar acting, plot.
1662	9	a	Preposterous with a capital P.
1663	6	a	What should have been graceful understatement instead reads as lifeless detachment.
1664	4	a	Imagine an average episode of Friends with subtitles, more sex and less laughs.
1665	7	a	Nothing more than a less charming rehash of the original Tigger tale.
1666	6	a	It's a far cry from the hilarious, edgy antics of Scary Movie, but it has about as much going for it as the first sequel.
1667	9	a	This is horror hokum of the cheesiest kind. Rent 'Orphan' instead.
1668	0	a	The story is twisted and complex, yet it emerges as sleek and unfussy. The characters' actions are grandly melodramatic, but the movie is close and intimate.
1669	3	a	"Raw and honest, ""Call Me By Your Name"" exposes loss of innocence while celebrating the importance of one's first love in a mature, albeit graphic, way."
1670	4	a	Good enough to make viewers a lot less leery of the whole post-apocalyptic future genre after The Postman.
1671	4	a	Heartbreaking and convincingly told it may be, Still Alice only hints at the desperation the disease leads to, shying away from depicting the true horror of Alzheimer's.
1672	2	a	Surprisingly emotional and unguarded, with a central performance that could be one of the year's best.
1673	6	a	This soap opera with some really silly scenes is not even close to Phillipa Gregory's spellbinding book.
1674	2	a	Let me tell you the bottom line: the movie is cute and it's enjoyable.
1675	1	a	Woody Allen must have had a great time writing this screenplay.
1676	7	a	I would avoid this film as readily as one avoids Siberia.
1677	6	a	I understand the need to set up a franchise, but 'The Darkest Minds' ends without fleshing out any of its ideas. Grade: Incomplete.
1678	3	a	It sizzles toward an explosive and satisfying climax in which everything -- Stallone included -- fully bursts into life.
1679	3	a	It's not a classic, but it is a solid, if somewhat stolid, picture of an extravagant, vaguely cerebral kind that's not made very often nowadays.
1680	5	a	"'Chappaquiddick' wants to ""dramatize"" the Chappaquiddick incident without offering a take on what really happened, and it doesn't quite work. "
1681	6	a	You know those artsy European coming-of-age movies set during World War II, like Europa, Europa? This is kind of like that, except with a few more beheadings, and everyone in Europe speaking English.
1682	5	a	It is a two-hour music video, Houston is pretty but dull, and the dynamo Bassett has been better elsewhere.
1683	9	a	Some films are ripped from the headlines, others are ripped from the pages of Cosmopolitan.
1684	4	a	Bee Movie has its moments but all in all there is very little sting in its tale.
1685	6	a	Memoirs loses its taste for risk, and settles, throughout the movie's subsequent melodramatic turns, for the familiar blandishments of good looks and technical control.
1686	8	a	Buzz kill.
1687	4	a	A perfect example of this unoriginal-but-enjoyable type of film making.
1688	4	a	Bigger, faster, funnier, and darker...[but] lacks the deep soul and character nuances of its predecessor.
1689	2	a	James White is a heartbreaking movie that runs on emotional adrenaline more than dramatic structure. 
1690	9	a	Director Greg Beeman can't disguise the lamentable script which, despite the best efforts of a likeable and willing cast, falls flat.
1691	5	a	Feels like an extended pilot in search of a weekly TV slot.
1692	4	a	Corny, but well-acted -- with some players showing surprising singing chops -- and heartfelt.
1693	1	a	Spielberg never solves the Schindler riddle, which keeps this from being a truly great picture. He does bring to Schindler's List the technical skill and dazzling smoothness of a movie-making natural.
1694	4	a	Jackson has made The Hobbit with brio and fun, and Martin Freeman is just right as Bilbo Baggins: he plays it with understatement and charm.
1695	3	a	This is a very simple story, but it builds beautifully to an endearing and witty romance.
1696	0	a	perhaps the greatest adventure movie of all time
1697	3	a	It's the nerd-dream technological singularity turned into a logistical nightmare, where free will is diametrically opposed to the next stage of our evolution.
1698	3	a	McDormand is righteous fury personified, and her performance-the best she's delivered since Fargo, maybe-is heartbreaking, but also wildly, profanely entertaining.
1699	4	a	Purely mechanical scenario owes much to robot-think, but little to Asimov's scientifically informed humanism.
1700	4	a	Two movies in one -- lively when people are talking, lame when things are happening.
1701	3	a	A fairly average and predictable comedy-mystery, it is raised a notch by the likes of Walken, Denis Leary, and the supporting cast
1702	6	a	The strain of sustaining its thin premise exhausts the film well before the final credits.
1703	9	a	It looks as if Disney simply borrowed and recycled the sets of Prince of Persia and Gladiator, adding leftover props from The Phantom Menace and Cowboys and Aliens.
1704	5	a	Rogen looks like he's waiting for the real leading man to turn up. And where exactly are the jokes?
1705	8	a	"Killer Joe"" is downright hysterical, clever, expertly written, and incredibly unnerving. This is easily a career best performance for Matthew McConaughey."
1706	3	a	It is a great film about a great love.
1707	2	a	The flick is undeniably fun and Spielberg's dusted off magic still works.
1708	4	a	It's spooky, suspenseful and jump-out-of-your-seat scary.
1709	3	a	Most of the hearty laughs are packed into the first half, but the more focused second part maintains interest as it cannily explores the topic of role reversals.
1710	3	a	[This] sequel... is quite a bit weirder, and possibly even disturbing in parts, but some clever ideas and the strong friendship between Vanellope and Ralph - and our love for them - carry things through.
1711	5	a	It does feel lazy, like a collection of plot points and performances that can't quite be bothered to form a whole.
1712	6	a	While I do think that Foster and the movies she makes need to lighten up, that isn't quite what I have in mind.
1713	3	a	"Mark Felt"" is pretty fascinating, and it should complement perfectly with films such as ""All The President's Men"" or ""Nixon""."
1714	4	a	Feels longer than it is, but still good fun.
1715	3	a	A terrific balance of comedy, drama and lyrical moments.
1716	9	a	You have to rely on more than fancy costumes to make a period piece interesting.
1717	4	a	It's bee-buzzingly silly.
1718	3	a	Like the composers the film so wondrously depicts, Amadeus: Director's Cut is a divine work in need of a little earthly restraint.
1719	1	a	Concise, elegant, a tad scary, this is a treat for Halloween.
1720	5	a	Early Man's reliance on groaning dad-humour and stereotypical celebrations of British daftness feels prehistoric in all the worst ways, especially as the film rolls out a rubbish football plot about being rubbish at football.
1721	1	a	Bad Lieutenant: Port of Call New Orleans -- why Port of Call? what does that mean? -- is no masterpiece, but it is undoubtedly the work of a master.
1722	0	a	People love to bash the third Rocky, but this film is as invigorating as any in the series.
1723	3	a	"...this movie is just as important as ""Black Panther"" or ""Wonder Woman"" in that it shows a true hero, the likes of which we don't see all that often on the big-screen. "
1724	2	a	"What I bought into was the way Jennifer Aniston handled herself, as I found her to be very appealing in this ""aw shucks, I'm so ordinary"" role."
1725	1	a	Everything works in this movie.
1726	3	a	But the best part of Logan Lucky is that from the get-go you know you're in confident hands, and whatever's about to happen, it's going to be great.
1727	6	a	Basically, this is a movie for people who read US Weekly but are smart enough to feel embarrassed about it.
1728	9	a	If I had a choice between suffering through a Dane Cook film or the outtakes from Carrot Top's Chairman of the Board, I'd go with the latter.
1729	3	a	Beautifully structured and performed.
1730	0	a	The film is an exhilarating exploration of the creative process.
1731	4	a	For what it is, A Perfect Getaway is absorbing and effective, largely due to Twohy's muscular direction and more-intriguing-than-you-expect work from the actors.
1732	2	a	Evinces the kind of swashbuckling bonhomie that made so many of us fall in love with the original Star Wars films, a love that was mightily tested by George Lucas' humorless prequels.
1733	3	a	"When the people stop talking and start singing, which is what happens in most of the movie, ""Black Nativity"" is glorious."
1734	0	a	An astonishing blend of action, comedy and drama, this sci-fi-western-mystery-thriller-adventure hybrid puts nearly every other big studio thrill ride - save Christopher Nolan's Batman Begins - to shame.
1735	6	a	If you don't expect much in terms of originality, there are some good times to be had here.
1736	6	a	The bone-crunchingly violent film has luridly entertaining moments. But by its resolution, this sleazy Southern Gothic nightmare has simply gone off the rails.
1737	3	a	A smartly constructed, emotionally involving, character-driven drama.
1738	3	a	The movie makes history downright thrilling, and it may very well prompt viewers to pick up a book and learn more.
1739	9	a	What do you do with a crummy horror movie that has been sitting on the shelf for a couple, or maybe three, years?
1740	3	a	Robert De Niro and Ben Stiller give the comedy of disaster a nice little workout.
1741	4	a	Works almost entirely through ellipsis and withholding.
1742	3	a	Overcomes the heavy-handed means of reaching its goal ... simply because Freeman believes every word and owns every sentiment that the Mandela of the film expounds, and we believe it right along with him.
1743	5	a	"Mark Felt: The Man Who Brought Down the White House"" is all handsome period costumes, smoky rooms and muttered dialogue; you could be forgiven for thinking it's any number of John Grisham plots."
1744	4	a	The Wedding Date's ending is one of the most contrived in recent memory...
1745	8	a	"'Screenwriter' Wayne Conley's idea of side-splitting dialogue is to have characters repeatedly tell King to ""kiss their black ass."" Or announce that they just ""pooted."
1746	2	a	A reasonably clean machine of escapist entertainment, directed resourcefully by Antal, who mines a generous amount of suspense out of a skeletal scenario.
1747	3	a	This is horror with a wink and a nod to drive-in theatres and sweaty back seats. This is how it's done.
1748	1	a	"This is the film that the last three ""Star Wars"" sequels should have been."
1749	3	a	A mite melodramatic and a tad predictable, but the melody is pretty enough to keep one listening.
1750	3	a	...an above-average Muppet movie...
1751	6	a	Failure to Launch isn't about story. It's about star power. Adjust your expectations accordingly.
1752	0	a	This is a remarkable achievement in filmmaking that managed to push the tale of the Holocaust into new realms of abhorrence I didn't think were possible after the masterpiece of Schindler's List.
1753	1	a	Packed with in-jokes, great characters and an offbeat anti-hero, Rango is the perfect shake-up the animated genre needed.
1754	4	a	Dramedy revisits famous festival, complete with drugs, sex.
1755	3	a	"The World's End"" is more like an antic sugar high than a reeling, drunken stupor. There are no headaches, dry mouth or crushing shame at the end - no ""Hangover,"" in other words. I'll drink to that."
1756	0	a	This seminal offering in the gay drama genre features remarkable performances by Michael Stuhlbarg, Armie Hammer and Timothee Chalamet, who also plays the love interest in Lady Bird.
1757	6	a	What's wrong with The Predator goes deeper than a couple of bad cuts, but it still stinks that a promising movie was scuttled by a director's questionable decision-making - both on set and in post.
1758	6	a	For Sally Fields fans, her presence should be enough to make this slight film bearable.
1759	2	a	"It's an entertaining and sometimes hilarious film that belongs squarely in Allen's ""hit"" column."
1760	4	a	A fetching and funny family film with special appeal to dog lovers.
1761	3	a	Inventive alien creatures are voiced by top-notch talent like Emma Thompson, David Hyde Pierce and Martin Short, while the lack of songs and updated character issues, including single parenthood, money and juvenile crime, keep the whole thing pretty hip.
1762	1	a	Newcomer Beharie gives a polished performance that deserves awards consideration.
1763	6	a	Maintains a light-hearted perspective, despite the blood.
1764	4	a	Delivers a realistic but familiar opera of forbidden courtships and wasted dreams.
1765	6	a	American Pastoral, the debut film of Ewan McGregor, lacks the brilliance of the Pulitzer-winning novel on which it is based. [Full review in Spanish]
1766	6	a	An absurdly jarring collection of archetypal characters in miserable circumstances with a resolution that feels forced and tacked on.
1767	5	a	The film's best moments are when McCarthy is left to her own improvisational devices with the camera still running, and that doesn't happen often enough.
1768	5	a	This is an unusually bold film, but it's also a morality tale that's riddled with hypocrisy and is frankly offensive. Not a blues movie as much as a blue movie.
1769	5	a	"How Do You Know"" is a complete misfire from famed writer/director James L. Brooks."
1770	3	a	It's an unconventional movie that's captivating, powerful, and entertaining down to its very last moments.
1771	6	a	Country Strong stumbles, and has some slack in its silences, but it takes its world, characters and songcraft seriously...
1772	3	a	...finally can't help but come off as something of a minor disappointment...
1773	0	a	Trainspotting is a remarkable film.
1774	9	a	The film descends into paralysis as the three head for their date with fate at the end of a European vacation.
1775	3	a	An congenial, occasionally laugh -out- loud satire that has a broad affection for its target.
1776	2	a	The franchise's signature elaborate action sequences are fewer and shorter, making for a more intimate, personal story.
1777	3	a	Director Jay Roach of the Austin Powers films keeps the pace brisk, and the script by Jim Herzfeld and John Hamburg ably piles the pratfalls ludicrously high.
1778	3	a	It's a visually and aurally riveting trip to an important time from a perspective few here will know, about a person worth meeting.
1779	0	a	"Sweet, sentimental, and vibrant, Woody Allen's ""Midnight in Paris"" rightfully points out that yesterday's frolicking bar might be today's laundry mat ... but we can always visit the good times in our memories."
1780	1	a	Like most Mann beverages, this one is a cocktail of nitroglycerin just waiting to be uncorked by a theatrical audience aching for something different.
1781	6	a	It's a bit strange, and strained.
1782	3	a	The film is both a police thriller and a drug addled fantasy with an iguana for a guide and Cage plays it like Hunter S. Thompson with a badge.
1783	4	a	When Close simply has something to think about or react to, she's magnetic. 
1784	5	a	Incredibly violent and extremely gory, this is more of a remake than a prequel and it squanders the opportunity to do something more interesting with the premise.
1785	4	a	When it got to the end, it seemed like a lot of effort for not much payoff.
1786	2	a	While flawed, The Soloist pulls at your heart. Some might argue the flick is too political, but in these dire economic times it is refreshing to not see glamour and fantasy.
1787	4	a	Blistering comedy run aground by cop-out ending.
1788	4	a	Lee's sizeable re-creation of the planet's greatest music festival is a sanitised trip.
1789	6	a	Welcome to Mooseport can't decide if it wants to be a political farce or a romantic comedy. It's a bit of both, but not enough of either.
1790	4	a	Gentle story of friendship is fine for wee ones.
1791	5	a	The Predator is just too damn stupid to survive.
1792	4	a	... for a film so affectingly steeped in loss, resignation and the ghosts of memory, the revelation... lacks emotional resonance.
1793	3	a	...directors/cinematographers Sarah Robertson and Adam Ravetch capture the struggle of life in this frozen wilderness with effective poignancy.
1794	3	a	Fincher takes time to build the mystery slowly, showing the numbing amounts of research as well as details like freezing-cold cabins and bad vending machine coffee. 
1795	8	a	Without the dark spookiness of Crystal Lake Camp, the horror concept completely loses its creepy menace.
1796	5	a	Eat Pray Love has some decent performances and the occasional good moment but it's ultimately let down by a tedious, self-satisfied script, a shocking lack of humour and a criminally indulgent running time.
1797	3	a	Classic MGM musical. A little arch, but good.
1798	5	a	If Paper Towns is representative of the youth of today, our species is truly doomed.
1799	6	a	Conrad Hall's distinguished cinematography, that captures the luminous beauty of Uma Thurman and her surroundings, can elevate this thriller only up to a point 
1800	5	a	Cruise's character, Claus von Stauffenberg, is off-putting and not just because he's a German with a pronounced American accent.
1801	2	a	Arriving on a big wave of gay jokes...
1802	3	a	The best imaginable film of very difficult material.
1803	4	a	It is a treat to see Sharif back on the screen and Boulanger is a pleasure to watch.
1804	7	a	A fitful, effects-driven and remarkably unambitious summer release about a midget jewel thief masquerading as a baby.
1805	4	a	Gorgeous to look at and frequently quite compelling ... but, obviously, not without some big gaping flaws.
1806	6	a	A vacuous attempt at chick flick epiphany. For all its postcard prettiness, Eat Pray Love's purported life lessons are so self-absorbed, had our shallow heroine been a man, we'd be booing his caddish behaviour.
1807	6	a	A slapdash affair, with paper-thin plotting and characters more or less redeemed by some winning musical sequences.
1808	3	a	In terms of sheer entertainment, The Cloverfield Paradox is a joy.
1809	3	a	This is a heart-stopping action film, teaching us the worthy lessons of discipline, teamwork, and determination, but wrapping them up in a deliberately provocative, shockingly violent package.
1810	4	a	Rambling story never detracts from the overall wonder
1811	3	a	DuVernay shows visual assurance and a way with actors and especially words.
1812	4	a	It loses some respect with its naked Mathilda May. But I would call this an audacious SF/horror film
1813	4	a	But asking her to play Etta James, even packing a few extra pounds around the hips, was a mistake: she wobbles, and tries to sound husky, and the movie sags noticeably under the sense of effort.
1814	3	a	It'll have you laughing and crying, sometimes in the same scene, and never feels anything other than sincere and authentic.
1815	4	a	Remain seated? No problem.
1816	5	a	The story has its origins in Hughes work, but it's been adapted, expanded and, well, heavily rewritten by director Kasi Lemmons, who apparently thought she could improve it. Yes, that's right. She thought she could improve Langston Hughes.
1817	3	a	'Hudson y McConaughey salvan el resultado final gracias simplemente a su encanto personal.'
1818	5	a	MacFarlane has corralled a great cast, which makes it especially disappointing that the movie's merely OK.
1819	0	a	This is the Wuxia masterpiece we've been waiting for.
1820	0	a	It's a film about drive, about imagination, and how brilliance thrives outside the mainstream. These are common enough themes given uncommon purchase in a film about a man who likely saved millions of lives by never fitting in.
1821	5	a	When film makers start making films about film makers, you begin to worry that they've run out of inspiration.
1822	4	a	Conspiracy abounds in this early Michael Douglas far fetcher.
1823	6	a	Piccoli gives the film a depth it perhaps doesn't deserve.
1824	4	a	The Adventures of Baron Munchausen stands as the moment when Terry Gilliam announced his importance as filmmaker to the rest of the world.
1825	10	a	This movie lacks the courage to admit what it is really about.
1826	5	a	Lame, late-in-the-day Wayne actioner.
1827	4	a	Take Jane out of the equation -- replace her with any of your basic period-piece-romantic-costume-drama heroines -- and you're left with mere trifle.
1828	3	a	Take a date and hold on tight.
1829	3	a	An affecting tale of an extraordinary human being.
1830	3	a	An incredibly catchy attempt at a retro sex comedy ... while it does go a bit overboard with the raunch at times, it offers enough solid laughs to make it worthwhile.
1831	9	a	Does as much disservice to its stars as it does to the art of graceful cinematic storytelling. 
1832	1	a	Packs as much humor, hard truth and vitality as the rapper's LPs.
1833	5	a	should have been a frothy farce, but instead takes several different attitudes, including action, melodrama, and mean-spirited nihilism. None of those are particularly successful
1834	3	a	Here we have an adult comedy that dares suggest that love is not always eternal. As it happens, that's a goldmine of untapped comedy potential. 
1835	7	a	Both Hanks and Vardalos tend toward slack, low-conflict storytelling, and the convergence of their sensibilities is an almost somnolent series of anecdotes in search of a story. 
1836	3	a	"Viewers of ""The Ring"" are more likely to remember the haunting images than the plot holes."
1837	4	a	A project that is rather shapeless with a protagonist who is less than compelling.
1838	4	a	It's a visual marvel and a inventive landmark in filmmaking history, but it's also a bit too empty.
1839	6	a	Rogen's Reid doesn't become a crime fighter for an altruistic reasons: He does it as a lark because he thinks it will be fun. Rogen's Hornet is basically the comic relief. And that is what throws the movie a-kilter.
1840	7	a	[It's] almost like you can feel Spielberg on autopilot, thinking about more interesting, challenging projects he'll be working on when this is done re-affirming his box-office credentials.
1841	2	a	It's an intimate, slice-of-life story in which things move deliberately, character goals are modest, and emotions -- both of the internal and external kind -- take center stage.
1842	4	a	Larry Crowne is neither dinner nor dessert, but rather the tasty and ultimately inconsequential appetizer you enjoy before moving on to the more substantive fare.
1843	5	a	Gibson has made a movie for nobody, really, but Gibson.
1844	0	a	One of the true great baseball films
1845	3	a	Says a prosecutor, during the trial: 'Beneath his intellectual and cultured exterior, he was moved by brutal impulses.' Is this also Lang's self-indictment? Or an indictment of any artist who trucks in sexual titillation and murder-as-entertainment? 
1846	5	a	"Everything before this has been crap"", says Rogen during the explosive finale. Many will agree."
1847	0	a	"Ralph Breaks the Internet"" ... and the box office."
1848	4	a	Silly teen comedy has some Neanderthal behavior.
1849	2	a	Sure, it has its precious moments -- but Hitch has the smarts to defuse them with large doses of slapstick, wit, or outright silliness.
1850	9	a	When you long for the fantasy of what Hal Needham could have brought to the material, you get the picture.
1851	5	a	Time-travel tale is a so-so action flick that plays like Jurassic Park ... but without the dinosaurs. Or stars. Or excitement.
1852	2	a	The Dressmaker's twists are best experienced blind, and its treats are modest but genuine.
1853	3	a	Eastwood's biopic is unconventional only in that it wisely does not attempt to tell Mandela's whole life story. Instead, it seizes on his rarest qualities, thus creating a moving tribute to a genuinely great humanitarian.
1854	0	a	Genius. Every aspiring screenwriter has been Barton Fink, and if they haven't yet, they will.
1855	3	a	... Reign of Fire is somehow greater than the sum of its parts.
1856	6	a	Most of the actors read their lines earnestly but flatly, and Kendrick has done them no favors by pushing them to play broad comedy in some scenes and anguished drama in others.
1857	6	a	"The movie's well-acted. Almost everything else about ""Country Strong"" is weak."
1858	2	a	It amiably follows along the tracks of the usual Lubitsch frothy boudoir operetta.
1859	1	a	Like the fading of day into twilight, the ephemeral nature of youth is deftly captured in The Kings of Summer.
1860	5	a	"The film simply can't and doesn't live up to the lofty expectations created by its ""Virgin"" predecessor."
1861	3	a	[Chloe] Zhao lyrically frames the characters within the shots, making them seem part of the landscape. Everything and everyone are natural parts of the images...
1862	9	a	Schneider's mugging is relentless and his constant need to suddenly transpose himself into another character undermines the story's continuity and progression.
1863	2	a	Despite all the twitches and tics, Cage makes Roy a highly sympathetic figure -- a confidence trickster with no confidence whose best deception is the one he reserves for himself.
1864	2	a	[Cianfrance] relentlessly tries to push the film's tropes and metaphors into something bigger and more powerful than they need to be, which creates an atmosphere of melodrama that even a trio of strong performances can't banish.
1865	8	a	A numbingly idiotic retread, a half-baked mixture of 'Duel' and 'The Hitcher' that's markedly inferior to both....Goes nowhere fast.
1866	4	a	The Way Back isn't much of a Christmas film, but it makes you glad to be indoors.
1867	3	a	A bonbon spiked with mirth and malice.
1868	5	a	Director Florian Henckel von Donnersmarck's name is far more exciting than his movie...
1869	1	a	Trainspotting is a singular sensation, a visionary knockout spiked with insight, wild invention and outrageous wit.
1870	0	a	A film whose biggest flaw is that it's occasionally too clever? That's yet another surprise in a movie that's overflowing with them.
1871	3	a	It may be a little overwrought for some tastes, borderline camp at points, but if you're partial to a bit of Victorian romance with Hammer horror gloop and big, frilly night-gowns, GDT delivers an uncommon treat.
1872	5	a	Yet because it's Smith, you know that Hancock can't be all bad, and as the film spends the next hour trying to rehabilitate him, proceedings slowly starts to fall apart.
1873	4	a	Invictus isn't a bad movie, but it's not nearly the rousing success it could have been.
1874	3	a	Getting the best of the laughs is the underrated Adam Scott who as Jason, is never afraid to share what's on his mind.
1875	3	a	Underrated Kevin Smith. Lots of inside jokes, background gags and smart dialogue.
1876	5	a	It calls for the suspension of the snort-and-chortle reflex. And it fails even at that.
1877	3	a	Snakes on a Plane is fully aware of how silly its situation is, but it doesn't try to take a tongue-in-cheek approach. It makes no apologies,
1878	4	a	Zanuck's disaster film, part of cycle that includes Ford's superior Hurricane, is not as entertaining as MGM's San Francisco, but the set-pieces of crowds, riots, and cattle stampedes during the fire are impressive.
1879	5	a	It has stylish fighting, but the story doesn't live up to the talent of the fight choreographer.
1880	3	a	How often do you find a sci-fi/horror hybrid that dares to walk the high wire? Not often enough, I think. For that reason alone, Lifeforce deserves to be rediscovered. 
1881	0	a	An unforgettable experience.
1882	1	a	This film truly belongs to Javier Bardem.
1883	5	a	For the most part, this story of trying to find out how you know you are in love is so slow and laborious you'll wish they'd just flip a coin and be done with it.
1884	4	a	At least there's a joke about how Amanda Seyfried looks a bit like Gollum. Take your victories and all that.
1885	0	a	A tense and spare examination of how these married people relate to each other after years of pain, mistrust and secrets have taken their toll.
1886	0	a	Bonello takes on the point of view of Saint Laurent himself, exposing a visionary world seen from within that is as strange and wonderful as that of a magnificently stitched garment turned inside out.
1887	4	a	Irrelevant animated film that comes out when Angry Birds isn't even popular anymore. [Full review in Spanish]
1888	3	a	The slow pace and the fact that the title gives away the entire plot should only be a minor annoyance to those who love strong writing, powerful acting and great filmmaking.
1889	6	a	Sometimes the Hollywood treatment can be a superhero's greatest arch-nemesis.
1890	0	a	It Comes at Night may well be the most minimalist horror movie ever made... an exceptionally tight, sly and, yes, heavy exercise in psychological suspense.
1891	0	a	It's scarier than a horror movie and sadder than anything you'll witness at the movies this year, but it's essential viewing all the same.
1892	3	a	The real comic bite comes from the combustible energy between the two lead actors.
1893	3	a	You have to appreciate the attention to detail and the beauty imbued into every scene by Rob Marshall and his crew
1894	2	a	For sheer audacity, Sausage Party is impressive.
1895	9	a	The perpetual engine of the unkillable Scary Movie chain is toxic cynicism.
1896	5	a	The movie's soundtrack and colorful cinematography can't smooth-talk itself past a mess of cultural insensitivities.
1897	2	a	While this whitewashes Chess of exploiting his black performers, fails to use the great voices of Berry and James, and minimizes the music, it picks up after a disjointed first half
1898	4	a	What could have been an intriguing look at how Alfred Hitchcock created one of his most iconic masterpieces is instead turned into a gently entertaining romp. 
1899	4	a	For once, Mirren seems like she's coasting in her fur coats and borrowed Dietrich attitude.
1900	6	a	[Keaton] doesn't have quite enough filmmaking savvy to balance the story's blend of heartbreaking and smile-coaxing moments.
1901	0	a	The finest adaptation of Joseph Conrad not based on Conrad.
1902	6	a	I say, bring back the pastel suits, the flamingos, and the Jan Hammer score. You can keep Phil Collins, though.
1903	4	a	The makers of Into the Blue know what the audience wants. And they deliver a little bit more.
1904	6	a	Cold Blood is a decent, but ultimately disappointing thriller. Instead of a throwback, we end up with something only slightly better than a throwaway.
1905	3	a	Bigger but not better.
1906	6	a	Parts have been cannibalized from better shockers and, worse, the stitches holding them together are so obvious they glow in the dark.
1907	4	a	Crass materialism and ridiculous marketing ploys are skewered by writer/director Derrick Borte in this uneven cautionary tale that starts off incisively funny, then devolves into preachiness.
1908	3	a	A vividly acted and directed movie that stretches the boundaries of its genre and keeps you in its ever-unpredictable grip throughout.
1909	1	a	"Skyfall"" may be the most intimate Bond film yet."
1910	4	a	John Carter is a visual delight at times, but the classic story is tiresome and the characters are largely unmemorable, leaving a cold, only occasionally thrilling experience.
1911	0	a	Watching Nosferatu is like standing in the same room as death itself.
1912	2	a	The entire ensemble of old pros play their designated roles well; standing out are Cumming, whose trademark impishness fits this role like a glove; and Danny Trejo, playing a nice guy for a change and pulling it off wonderfully.
1913	7	a	No better than a run-of-the-mill made-for-cable movie on any network that caters to pre-teens...[but] boys of a certain age--six to ten, perhaps--may enjoy [it].
1914	10	a	The Libertine could be one of the most atrocious films you will ever see in your entire life.
1915	5	a	It's so profoundly, mind-blowingly offensive that you almost have to admire the writer/director Craig Brewer's nerve.
1916	1	a	"Both times I saw ""Inherent Vice,"" I experienced roughly the same contradictory responses: delight undercut by puzzlement, followed by a happier sort of puzzlement."
1917	8	a	The Cloverfield Paradox may be a splash for Netflix, but it's a dud as a sci-fi thriller.
1918	9	a	Yet another failed effort at making Madonna a legit actress, in a preposterous thriller could be labeled Basic Stink.
1919	4	a	On the surface a beautiful film. But those looking for some hidden spiritual meaning be warned - Eat Pray Love doesn't go that deep.
1920	3	a	"A hilarious, but melancholy and intuitive stoner noir that leaves much to contemplate."" "
1921	4	a	This is a film that feels like it has made the mistake of attempting to give its audience everything it could possibly want, but the good news is that the ensuing messiness still has plenty to enjoy. 
1922	5	a	The movie is utterly unable to tie up its admittedly creepy ideas with any degree of coherence
1923	6	a	Harry and Sally are tired of this.
1924	5	a	Whenever Beresford concerns himself with politics or, even worse, personal drama, Dancer falls limply to the ground.
1925	4	a	It's not a bad film, but it's certainly a timid one ...
1926	4	a	"Palo Alto"" is good at capturing the aimless rhythms of teenagedom, from party to car to school to party. It doesn't always make for compelling viewing, but it certainly feels accurate."
1927	4	a	Armored's first half is an overwrought, eye-rolling bro-venture, but once the actual robbery takes place, the film ratchets up into a solid testosterone-soaked thriller.
1928	3	a	Even someone with amnesia would recognize the spy-thriller tactics on display here, but at least they're skillfully used.
1929	4	a	The gulag scenes also are vividly sketched. Sadly, the personal dramas often feel stock and static by comparison.
1930	0	a	It's worth every penny.
1931	2	a	Even if certain elements of the movie seemed familiar individually, the whole of the enterprise feels different. It's a different voice and approach, and different is good.
1932	3	a	This is such a brave performance by Glenn Close, who in making Albert so real, makes the character as pathetic and unlikable as she must have been in life.
1933	2	a	"I long to be as free as Hammer is in the scene in which Oliver dances, wildly and gracelessly, to The Psychedelic Furs' ""Love My Way."
1934	4	a	No one seems to know what the movie is about; is it about the friendship, Thomas's life and women, or the war?
1935	1	a	The biopic captures a psychology and aesthetic in an exhilarating, sensual, cerebral fashion.
1936	3	a	Dark, disturbing and original throughout.
1937	2	a	Lane and Cusack transcend the formulaic nature of the romantic comedy genre 
1938	6	a	Benzina has a hip look to it. The film is set in a particularly bleak urban landscape and has plenty of noir elements and edge, visually speaking, but the story is ridiculous.
1939	3	a	There is much to admire in this big budget Hindi film that never falls into the trappings of the 'masala' formula. 
1940	5	a	While despair underlies Almodovar's film...the director attempts to lighten up with some misplaced jokes. These, though, are never any more than a brief respite from the irritating mess in which the characters embroil themselves.
1941	9	a	Brings back the same cast, but forgets the heart, wit, wonder, and warmth. This is a soulless sequel.
1942	4	a	The actors are offering first-rate work to a second-class script.
1943	4	a	"Recommended to people who have seen more than a few episodes of ""Star Trek,"" and especially to those who have ever been to a Trek convention"
1944	1	a	I am happy to say that the misogynists' worst fears were realized. This is very much a movie whose female characters are equal to their male counterparts...
1945	6	a	Timeline fails to grab you and sustain any feeling of wonder. The time travel is treated so matter of factly ... that it, too, cannot stir the imagination. 
1946	3	a	Taste the Blood of Dracula is unusual in that it keeps Dracula somewhat on the sidelines.
1947	6	a	In pondering the Big Picture, Benjamin Button often falls under the spell of its own epic sweep, inviting us to join its makers in marveling at the marvelousness of it all.
1948	3	a	For a story in which emotions are tamped down and shunted, The Rider finds a moving and difficult power.
1949	6	a	Storyline is formulaic and it tries too hard to wring emotion out of the audience...you can feel the puppet strings.
1950	4	a	Here's a sweet film to rent for Father's Day or Christmas. It's a heart-warmer, charming, and shot with a sugary cinematic eye.
1951	3	a	De Mornay at her diabolical best.
1952	6	a	But, sadly, it's not a good movie. 
1953	3	a	Gordon has an engaging screen presence that keeps us on his side.
1954	1	a	Knocked Up is an ambient, funny movie more devoted to enjoying the journey of its characters' world than it is bothered with its destination.
1955	3	a	A textbook example of how keeping it simple can yield big rewards -- and big laughs.
1956	8	a	Crams a whole season of Real World fights, flings, cover-ups and send-off parties into one bloated pastry of a film.
1957	3	a	Bale is outstanding as Bateman.
1958	9	a	The desperately unfunny kidnapping farce King's Ransom is the cinematic equivalent of trampled chewing gum on a subway platform.
1959	8	a	Poison ivy jokes. Poop jokes. Runaway bus jokes. Young love jokes. Skunk jokes. Some fake fatherly tender moments. Vomit jokes. This film has them all.
1960	3	a	Abounds with kid-friendly thrills.
1961	3	a	Apatow shows how a comedy should and can be more like life, without sacrificing a laugh.
1962	0	a	Simply irresistible.
1963	3	a	A glibly entertaining corporate thriller.
1964	4	a	This is a strong ensemble but the story kind of has that 'After School Special for Grown-ups' feel - instant histories but not a lot of development for the characters.
1965	3	a	Best name for a western of any film in history.
1966	3	a	Jane Campion has turned the short and doomed affair between John Keats and Fanny Brawne into an enthralling film that tenderly rips your heart to shreds.
1967	8	a	To call Wrong Turn tedious and uninspired is to be kind.
1968	4	a	Examines the ways that the faith and morals of a priest are tested.
1969	2	a	With an engaging love story not on offer, we're left with the action sequences, which are all terrific.
1970	5	a	The satire gradually becomes overdone and heavy-handed.
1971	9	a	A mean and depressing B-movie in which there's no one to root for or even care about.
1972	6	a	What's most disappointing is the thoroughly cliched story.
1973	2	a	Selma creates a sense of real life being lived, rather than just facts and figures being dramatized. 
1974	3	a	A treat to ponder and deconstruct. Sombre nocturnes are rarely so entertaining.
1975	0	a	If Wright doesn't quite sustain this astonishing mixture of sadness and silliness all the way through, he gets major points just for attempting it in the first place.
1976	3	a	... Cuba's geriatric music troupe get a touching send-off in Lucy Walker's hagiographic but moving documentary.
1977	1	a	...a film that is genuine, sweet, strongly acted and well written at a time when such qualities are virtually nonexistent at the local multiplex.
1978	9	a	Do anal probe gags sound like fine family entertainment? How about multiple scenes depicting ugly gay panic? Not to worry; a penis joke referring to a male member as an 'antenna' is right around the corner.
1979	4	a	Director Maggie Cary, instead of raising the bar of farce to the heights, has lowered it to the depths of the pigsty. She's proven that the gals can roll about in the mud just as well as the guys can, but to what end?
1980	4	a	Cute comedy is Groundhog Day for tweens.
1981	9	a	A movie set in the frozen north that just idles, endlessly, in the sitcom hothouse where convention slowly but surely becomes moldy cliche.
1982	9	a	"A specious ""inspired by a true story"" slice of Royalist claptrap."
1983	5	a	Julianne Moore does all the heavy lifting in what otherwise feels like a TV movie.
1984	5	a	Clumsy, overlong.
1985	3	a	Not many animated escapades aim to please such a broad audience. Even the poo jokes are sophisticated.
1986	6	a	The self-serious Equilibrium makes its point too well; a movie, like life, isn't much fun without the highs and lows.
1987	8	a	The combination of optimism, tragedy, and the fuzzy warmth of new love is absolutely flawless.
1988	4	a	A totally strange, gore-drenched horror/comedy about ancient pagan rituals that leaves you with only one certain thought in your head: that Ken Russell is one very bent fellow.
1989	5	a	In spite of Amelia Vincent's toothsome cinematography and the down-home locations, the movie often has the lumbering, literal-minded rhythms of a second-rate stage play -- not a moan or a howl, but a slow, anxious groan.
1990	9	a	The effects aren't up to blockbuster standards and the story goes nowhere slowly
1991	3	a	Nothing can soften the tragedy that characterised Turing's later years, but this remains a testament to a singular, brilliant man and his extraordinary achievements.
1992	2	a	How to Lose a Guy smoothly satirizes the superficiality of man-hungry women and the soullessness of sex-hungry men.
1993	10	a	Dane Cook plays a dentist in Good Luck Chuck... Having had braces, three tooth extractions, three bone graphs, and three dental implants, I can say with relative ease that none of that was as painful as watching this pathetic waste of celluloid.
1994	3	a	[Director Chloe] Zhao observes her objects of study with attention, reluctant to be condescending to them or to romanticize them. [Full review in Spanish]
1995	3	a	Not a huge amount happens yet it is transfixing at times, largely a product of superbly moulded characters, gentle humour, refined performances and a charming devotion to human warmth.
1996	1	a	As the film flies forward, it finds more and more inventive ways to show us, to entertain us, to make us laugh.
1997	2	a	Watch it for the actors and the gorgeous sea-coast imagery.
1998	3	a	"Perfectly enjoyable sci-fi re-take on ""Hell in the Pacific."
1999	2	a	It aims to be pleasant and good-natured, which it is. There are enough laughs scattered throughout to keep everything moderately amusing, and the cast is likeable.
2000	1	a	At its best, Gladiator is one of the great films of all time.
2001	4	a	Bolstered by a subtly funny supporting turn by Kevin Kline and a scenery-chewing performance by Kenneth Branagh, Smith carries the movie with his signature ease.
2002	9	a	Midway, Mondays in the Sun becomes as dull as a day with nothing to do.
2003	4	a	Seth MacFarlane is tedious, but Charlize Theron saves the day.
2004	4	a	think of Must Love Dogs as a You've Got Mail without Norah Ephron's neuroses
2005	0	a	If the essence of Generation X's journey from restless youth to semiproductive maturity could be encapsulated into one film, it would be Trainspotting.
2006	4	a	Huppert is always a pleasure on screen, and her performance as a competent, consummate professional is Special Treatment's main draw.
2007	1	a	"An awkward start, especially as it takes a moment to get used to Russell's style and tone, but once ""Hustle"" finds its footing it really takes off and is one of the most intelligent and enjoyable films of the year."
2008	3	a	The pace may be uneven but the music side of this album is worth watching and especially listening to.
2009	3	a	This comedy has a few violent scenes.
2010	4	a	Gibson places his faith in Christ's suffering, and is determined to make the moviegoer suffer in Jesus' name as well.
2011	3	a	A well-acted and intriguing exploration of dishonesty in its varied forms, leavened with a dry comic touch.
2012	5	a	Vin Diesel proves he can't tell the difference between good and bad movies.
2013	4	a	As you'd expect from Eastwood and this cast, it's got quality written all over it.
2014	1	a	The Whip and the Body is a gothic horror fantasy that finds Bava at the peak of his visual prowess.
2015	3	a	Put this movie on your must see list and enjoy a truly uplifting sports story.
2016	4	a	Intense drama asks what comes after death.
2017	5	a	Aside from a few inspired vistas and alien life-forms, John Carter is as deadly dull as its basso-voiced, beefcake slab of a star.
2018	4	a	Not perfect, by any means, but a top night out
2019	3	a	One of the most pictorially concentric American films of recent years.
2020	3	a	Eastwood directs all this with skill if not overwhelming urgency, delivering a classy, sincere, meticulously crafted picture.
2021	3	a	If they gave an Oscar for best ensemble acting, and I think they should, The Grey Zone would get my vote. 
2022	1	a	Jewison's attention to detail is undeniable -- great care was taken to represent Jewish customs as accurately as possible.
2023	3	a	Extremely funny, well written and sharply observed comedy with strong comic performances from its talented cast.
2024	2	a	Not only a coming-of-age story and cautionary parable, but also a perfectly rendered period piece.
2025	5	a	Immaculate style, questionable substance.
2026	9	a	I still don't care.
2027	4	a	Works only because of the likability of Hanks and Roberts.
2028	6	a	A Million Ways to Die in the West has a clever and sometimes hilarious setup, but it has no idea how to follow through on it.
2029	9	a	The filmmakers try to squeeze action from their trampling of a genre.
2030	7	a	An embarrassing effort, at best.
2031	1	a	A true, fine and involvingly human piece of work.
2032	6	a	Spade is hilarious, especially when he's taking shots at Hollywood and the whole celebrity game. But when Dickie Roberts gets maudlin, Spade shows only too clearly he's not an actor.
2033	4	a	It belts along pleasingly enough, but this frenetic, hard-edged comedy drama is too hackneyed to be entirely successful.
2034	0	a	Coppola, who wrote and directed, creates the perfect languorous mood to match these characters' emotional limbo.
2035	5	a	I don't like to kvetch, but I do think it's a little unfair when I see the same film over and over, and I have to keep coming up with something new to say about it.
2036	5	a	It's ironic that this, perhaps the weakest Bond film, contains the character's most important piece of development.
2037	3	a	Clue meets Gosford Park, an airy musical murder mystery with style and flair to spare.
2038	4	a	Another lukewarm comedy.
2039	5	a	Pot may impair your decision-making, but only speed will drive a man to drop trou and crap on another's living room floor.
2040	2	a	While treating his subject matter with the utmost respect, Whedon also infuses it with his trademark off-kilter wit.
2041	2	a	[Chan]'s not only a great martial artist but he's a hell of an actor too.
2042	3	a	It's an effective bit of Hammer horror, boasting the expected atmospherics, period trappings, literary conceits and, yes, buxom beauties.
2043	3	a	Formulaic but consistently funny.
2044	3	a	It's still a great film though - expertly mixing a political biopic and an underdog sports movie together, which under a less sure hand could have turned out like The Mighty Ducks coached by George W.
2045	3	a	This is an important document and a fresh, intimate portrayal.
2046	4	a	The movie is full of great ideas and even has some strange visual poetry moments, specially when Portman and Edgerton share the screen. [Full review in Spanish]
2047	3	a	One will never wish to go through precisely what White does, but losing one's parents is inevitable, and the film is a searingly authentic portrait of the process.
2048	3	a	Scott's film may keep us at arm's length, but it holds us, too.
2049	5	a	If it has the right spit-in-your-face attitude, it has neither the stamina nor the wit to go the distance, although it makes it about two-thirds of the way.
2050	4	a	It's jazzy fluff, but the film panders.
2051	1	a	The wrenching documentary Deliver Us From Evil explores the mind of a pedophile as it accuses the Catholic Church of failing to protect children.
2052	5	a	Alfie begins and ends by asking, 'What's it all about?' Unfortunately, it's a question the filmmakers never bother to answer.
2053	1	a	With expansive shots of protests in motion and intimate, shadowy close-ups of King locked in jail, DuVernay's direction brings to life what many only know in black-and-white snapshots.
2054	6	a	...large swaths of the proceedings feel as though they'd be more at home within a garden-variety sitcom.
2055	6	a	Decade-old leftovers reaching for laughs.
2056	9	a	By spelling out the traumas that turned a kind Lithuanian princeling into an epicurean serial killer, the movie reduces a figure of mythic evil to a jumbo case of post-traumatic stress disorder.
2057	3	a	If The Bourne Identity is an example of indie-movie rogue agents gone amok, then mainstream Hollywood should definitely recruit a few more.
2058	8	a	An unfunny jumble of absurdities.
2059	2	a	A fun, amusing, will-they-or-won't-they confection -- a love rhombus wherein a hastily married couple grapples with mutually wandering eyes.
2060	6	a	If not for the commanding presence of Samuel L. Jackson in the title role, this paint-by-numbers sports movie wouldn't have anything going for it.
2061	4	a	A brilliantly performed, gut-wrenchingly sad flick
2062	9	a	A dud of a comedy that wastes a top-notch cast on a ridiculous premise.
2063	4	a	Not every boomer sold out. A few hippies managed to survive middle age with their flower intact, and Hollywood loves to make movies about them because they are the unicorns of the grown-up world.
2064	1	a	A bravely irresponsible movie anchored to a visual metaphor so outlandish and powerful it seems destined for cinema immortality.
2065	4	a	[David O.] Russell is not Scorsese. He doesn't do 'cool shots' with the camera. His passion is for observing actors, giving them the space to create chaos that his frames struggle to contain.
2066	5	a	Painfully pretentious and shallow.
2067	9	a	Even scrumtious manlyberry ala mode McConaughey cant save this fiasco. Failure to Launch fails to entertain - in the least.
2068	3	a	The perfect summertime movie. Munch your popcorn and let your senses absorb all the fantastic fun.
2069	5	a	As Benjamin Franklin once observed, houseguests -- like fish -- begin to smell after three days. In [this] case, however, it takes less than two hours. 
2070	1	a	I want to shake each and every one of these actor's hands.
2071	6	a	Surely a better title would have been 'Saturday'.
2072	4	a	It's Bullock's first shot at a role in which she plays second fiddle neither to males nor special effects. And she turns out to be every bit as delightful as anyone might have expected.
2073	3	a	What you end up admiring about the film is its literacy, its authenticity ... and its refusal to let us down easily.
2074	10	a	At least supermodel Naomi Campbell had sense enough to merely sing under the opening credits rather than try something out of her league.
2075	4	a	It's entertaining and funny enough, but like your average quote whore, shows you what you'd like to see, even if it's not entirely what is deserved.
2076	4	a	Reign of Fire, in fact, may be the best Mad Max film to not feature the character of Mad Max.
2077	4	a	Charlize Theron is super-sexy, and devilishy memorable
2078	6	a	Imagine a World War II film about those brave German soldiers, touching briefly on the Jews but going on about what wonderful people Goring and General Rommel were.
2079	0	a	Both a heartwarming and heartwrenching tale of love, loss and discovery that could be my favorite film of the year. Timothee Chalamet, Armie Hammer and Michael Stuhlbarg give award-caliber performances in a film that is an important as it is beautiful.
2080	5	a	Inoffensively bland.
2081	4	a	Bandslam had potential, but it succumbed to peer pressure.
2082	5	a	full review at Movies for the Masses
2083	3	a	[Concentrates] more on the man than the equipment.
2084	6	a	"As a work of devotion and faith, ""The Passion"" is a success. As a piece of filmmaking, it is a failure."
2085	2	a	As a director, [Roos] brings a keen eye for character and nuance to his writer-side's lapses.
2086	5	a	An entertaining adaptation that has little to contribute to the panorama of young adult adaptations. [Full Review in Spanish]
2087	3	a	Will grab your children by the imagination and amaze them and amuse them.
2088	6	a	Your mileage may vary, as they say. Also, hugs not drugs.
2089	3	a	A stylish meditation on alienation and ennui.
2090	4	a	Little more than wasted potential - a would-be thriller that could have been great fun, but instead is as appealing as a plate of cinematic leftovers.
2091	4	a	Babe needed a sequel as much as Citizen Kane or Casablanca.
2092	4	a	A tense urban drama about two gutsy undercover cops who enjoy their improvised lives of danger and surprises. 
2093	5	a	Consists largely of nasty knocks against the fat, old, and Asian, all of whom are framed in cramped compositions that suggest the influence of Simpsons animation cells and Ulrich Seidl.
2094	0	a	McDonagh has a way of exploring guilt and redemption, family and purpose, in ways that I'm not sure have quite crossed the screen before.
2095	4	a	It's a great movie for kids, until you have to explain the knife fight and the Cold War. Can little Sammy spell shiv?
2096	4	a	Not Murray's best and not Levinson's either.
2097	4	a	A very entertaining, unusual and loveable mess.
2098	2	a	The movie is helped by music and lyrics by George and Ira Gershwin.
2099	3	a	The simple fact is that despite its flaws Milagro is still a very pleasant outing, loaded with delightful characters and a great many very enjoyable set-pieces.
2100	4	a	The plot's restless shifts in point of view mean that significant action and mere movement become hopelessly confused with one another.
2101	2	a	The surprising thing about it is not how funny it is, as that's to be expected, but how serious it is. Also surprising: It works.
2102	2	a	A smart, stylish portrait of a romance that never happens, with excellent performances and a message delivered in restrained whisper rather than Hollywood shout.
2103	5	a	It's disappointing, losing most of the original's flavour, while retaining and amplifying what was muddled and unsatisfying about it in the first place.
2104	8	a	Surprisingly adapted from a novel, Date is saccharine, uninspired entertainment, eventually collapsing into a flat-out mess.
2105	4	a	Though The Ring is only a copy, it still can carry the echo of a real chill.
2106	1	a	An extremely honest attempt to convey abstraction in an essentially non-abstract medium.
2107	2	a	It's an oddly compelling story, handsomely made, and showcasing another fine role for the impressive Mia Wasikowska.
2108	6	a	Rarely has a more serious effort produced a less serious result.
2109	3	a	The Bourne Identity shouldn't be half as entertaining as it is, but director Doug Liman and his colleagues have managed to pack it with enough action to satisfy the boom-bam crowd without a huge sacrifice of character and mood.
2110	3	a	Features several strong performances.
2111	4	a	A road to ruin paved more by mindless conformity than by good intentions.
2112	3	a	A deluge of movies is set to be released in the next three weeks. One that should not be lost in the flood is Light It Up.
2113	4	a	America takes another halting step towards confronting its racist past with this solid, if dry, look at a pivotal moment in the Civil Rights Movement.
2114	5	a	Despite the title, Wasabi isn't so spicy.
2115	6	a	The story quickly slips into Austen formula.
2116	6	a	A superficial chronicle of political deception as writer/director Peter Landesman completely fails to capture the compelling drama of 'All the President's Men.'
2117	2	a	Having Jackie Chan's capable martial arts talents involved in this mix helps to keep the humor level high and the fight scenes exciting.
2118	5	a	An irresistible idea results in a movie as hazy and sometimes as irritating as cigarette smoke.
2119	6	a	When the most sympathetic character in the movie is a potential suicide bomber, you know something's wrong.
2120	2	a	May not be the smartest movie on the block, but it's slickly packaged with a good sales pitch.
2121	8	a	Full of repugnant junkies so unpleasant that I was hoping they'd all OD just so I could escape this torture test.
2122	5	a	Evelyn is working so hard to be inspiring that the actors start wearing halos before they've even earned them.
2123	3	a	Playing Hitchcock, Anthony Hopkins is a mountain of prosthetics. But his portrayal hits all the right, disturbingly quiet notes and the impersonation quickly settles into performance.
2124	3	a	Jenkins makes a huge leap forward in her sophomore film, a serio comedy that effortlessly blends humor and pathos in a tale of a dysfunctional family in which the two misfit siblings are splendidly played by Laura Linney and Philip Seymour Hoffman.
2125	3	a	Inspired by the touching book -- by Los Angeles Times columnist Steve Lopez -- Downey, Foxx and Wright make appealing, if just short of beautiful, music.
2126	6	a	Fans of the memoir might enjoy this film; others will be checking their watches more than once. 
2127	3	a	First Reformed is an art movie, pure and simple. It won't attract the teenage action-loving crowd. It won't break any box-office records. But it's beautiful, thoughtful and full of grace.
2128	7	a	The movie is a dog from start to finish, with enough genre inconsistencies and plot holes to make it a textbook example of borrowing from too many divergent horror films to get anything right.
2129	4	a	In these days of cutbacks and belt-tightening, its story has a strong resonance.
2130	2	a	This is a film about power, and how being born with the right name can be enough to reshape reality. 
2131	3	a	It's not as catchy a title, but The Incredibles is more like The Really Goods.
2132	5	a	Though both lead actors are able to coast for a while on their natural charm, it's evident by the soppy finale that their Sleepless in Seattle and Pretty Woman salad days are long past.
2133	2	a	... an irritating, smug film about a horrible person, a narcissistic destroyer of worlds so caught up in romancing her impossibly sensitive self that she doesn't even notice the needless damage she inflicts on her fellow creatures.
2134	3	a	...a film about healing through pain, the way the blues can heal.
2135	4	a	misses many opportunities to truly exploit its old-school ethos, instead falling into the trap of hyper-edited incoherence
2136	6	a	Am I the only person who is tired of seeing actors play characters who fall in love with beautiful women half their age?
2137	2	a	...whole-heartedly casts its lot with the grown-ups in the audience, paying homage to Sergio Leone, Carlos Castaneda, Hunter S. Thompson, and Roman Polanski's Chinatown. ...So, let's dispel the illusion that this movie is for kids.
2138	0	a	A wonder-inducing combo of time travel and romantic comedy that tickles the funny bone and provokes thought about the different dimensions of time.
2139	9	a	Is there not something just plain wrong with a movie about cheating on exams that's less fun than taking one?
2140	4	a	It's the casting that provides balance, and low-key laughs.
2141	4	a	"A terrifying triumph of hype, but...also the movie to preserve for all of Earth's recorded history Samuel L. Jackson lowering his gaze at Julianna Margulies and asking, ""Sporks?"" I dare you to look away."
2142	4	a	Seinfeld doesn't need to go back to his 'show about nothing' premise, but here's hoping his next project can be about just a little less.
2143	3	a	Will Smith proves that if he ever wants to stop fighting screen robots, aliens or drug dealers, he is more than able to fill the rom-com leading-man shoes.
2144	5	a	Cronenberg turns a difficult, sometimes frustrating book into a difficult, sometimes frustrating movie, though one with many of the same rewards as its source material ...
2145	1	a	I defy anyone to find a story of first love -- its triumphs and heartbreaks, its feverish beginnings and its sad endings -- that's as passionate or as moving as the one told in Call Me by Your Name.
2146	4	a	A second look reveals everything wrong with the movie, but on first pass, it's well-performed and enjoyably crafted.
2147	3	a	This is a ride, a video game, a soundtrack -- unapologetic and clearly labeled as such. It has no middle speed.
2148	1	a	"A smart film about manners, money and marriage, ""Becoming Jane"" offers a fictional glimpse at the all-too-brief life of author Jane Austen."
2149	7	a	Secret Window is filled with so many red herrings, one could have a veritable feast if one were to filet them, cream them, and serve them with a box of crackers.
2150	4	a	Often feels silly but only occasionally fun.
2151	3	a	In the glorious spectacle Gladiator, director Ridley Scott [re-creates] -- with a startling physicality and immediacy -- the Roman Empire that once blanketed most of Europe. 
2152	6	a	Overall, I recommend Devil's Due if you won't mind that the film isn't scary and that it doesn't offer anything new.
2153	2	a	Saoirse Ronan is stunning, carrying herself as regal as a woman can be, stretching her terrific acting chops as a woman whose judgment in men is not always on the money.
2154	4	a	Check your brain with the usher and lavish in the beauty of Venice in the summer with Depp and Jolie as your sneaky and energetic guides. 
2155	4	a	Just another generic suspense film destined to top the box office charts for one week before dropping into obscurity.
2156	2	a	Even as this comedy strains to be goofy and transgressive, it catches us by surprise simply because it dares to explore first-time sexual experiences through female eyes. 
2157	4	a	It's not exceptional filmmaking - the characters are particularly thin - but that doesn't make it anything less than necessary viewing.
2158	2	a	A small film, but also an uncommonly lovely work.
2159	9	a	Poor Ben Grimm suffers the most tragic fate. He is transformed from the charismatic, brilliant actor Michael Chiklis into a giant prosthetic goofy suit that fools no one.
2160	4	a	Renny Harlin's finest moment. That should tell you something.
2161	6	a	There probably isn't a single character in Alpha Dog you would consider likable or sympathetic. And yet, the film almost works in spite of that. Almost.
2162	6	a	In the wrong hands, this would have been a maudlin, embarrassing story, but in McCanlies' hands, it feels like a cozy friend.
2163	4	a	Despite choppy, clunky moments, it leaves you with a smile.
2164	1	a	"The movie basically adheres to the conventions of the genre as well as the Western spoofs made popular by comedians such as Bob Hope, Abbott and Costello, and Mel Brooks in ""Blazing Saddles."
2165	2	a	Owes more to the swashbuckling serials of yesteryear cinema than it does to cold, steely science fiction ponderings of the future.
2166	3	a	This film is fun most of the time.
2167	2	a	The Soloist foregoes easy solutions, and even more importantly, it foregoes any easy sense of friendship.
2168	6	a	It's Re-Animator with a little bit of Flatliners and a whole lot of yawns. 
2169	1	a	...another strong effort from the Irish McDonagh, who simply gets it when it comes to grand filmmaking.
2170	4	a	There's definitely something refreshing about seeing a full-blown retro crime thriller, but Oren Shai's feature directorial debut is reduced to a mere novelty because there's so little access to the main characters.
2171	3	a	...manages enough of the pathos that has made Romero's zombie movies the paragon of the genre.
2172	7	a	Think less Wedding Crashers and more War of the Roses minus the oddly romantic violence.
2173	3	a	Outrageously disjointed and just as outrageously entertaining, the picture stands as a successful outsider's tribute to a failed kindred spirit.
2174	4	a	Entertaining but problematic, WTF almost hits the target but is scuppered by friendly fire.
2175	2	a	This slow, episodic film is held together by the galvanic presence of Javier Bardem.
2176	3	a	Technically this movie is really, really excellent.
2177	6	a	I came away from this film unsure of what it was trying to say, unsure of how to classify it, and definitely unhappy with the ending.
2178	0	a	Sultry and oh-so sexy, Call Me By Your Name is a masterful piece and romantic enough to win over even the hardest of hearts.
2179	1	a	"Nearly from the start, there is the sense of rebirth and resurrection [in ""The Man Without a Past."
2180	4	a	As director, Eastwood has decided to go for cinematic poetry, and occasionally he manages to achieve just that.
2181	5	a	Relatively unfunny comedy about barnyard animals. It is notable mainly for its anatomically incorrect portrayal of bulls with udders.
2182	9	a	Less amusing than being bound, gagged, and tortured.
2183	2	a	A genuinely wonderful comedy, brought to life be a genuinely wonderful cast and an interesting director.
2184	4	a	This bookend of Grahame's latter life - though entertaining and not without wonderful nuanced moments, an evocative soundtrack and light laughs - is maddeningly gun shy.
2185	0	a	It's almost too good to be true that the Coen Brothers have adapted McCarthy's novel and brought it to the screen, though it is their bleakest work to date.
2186	2	a	Undoubtedly one of Ang Lee's lighter films, 'Taking Woodstock' is also one of his better ones, and a welcome return to form.
2187	3	a	While this might not be what we expect from a film about The Master of Suspense, it's oddly a fun romp, with Helen Mirren eventually stealing the show.
2188	5	a	Suffers from an air of affectation and artificiality made worse by the convoluted structure imposed on the narrative.
2189	3	a	Slavery corrupts owners as well as their enslaved as this starkly beautiful, dreamlike fable assures us.
2190	0	a	The most embarrassingly entertaining movie I've seen all year.
2191	6	a	It would be a better movie if everyone involved had concentrated on making the behavior of the three heroes more believable.
2192	9	a	A lumpy soup of western action and supernatural shenanigans, heavily spiced with narrative confusion.
2193	5	a	Crimson Peak isn't a horror. It's not that good either.
2194	6	a	Despite the on-screen intelligence of Kendrick, plus a screenplay co-written by Mike White, this is a near-plotless, slapdash comedy marked by low-energy improvisation and strained slapstick.
2195	8	a	Unpleasant, uncouth and painfully unfunny, Larry the Cable Guy attempts lowbrow humor with neither the wit of the Farrelly brothers nor the raunchy inventiveness of Keenen Ivory Wayans.
2196	3	a	Ang Lee's unprecedented use of digital technology makes for a hyperreal immersion into the mind of a traumatized soldier.
2197	6	a	"The third and final installment in the ""Pitch Perfect"" franchise is aca-blah."
2198	7	a	The new Alfie is a disappointment and a crushing bore.
2199	5	a	Too many time trips detract from the present, and their comic shenanigans border on embarrassing.
2200	6	a	"Next Stop, Greenwich Village"" isn't aggressively awful. It is inept but mostly it's just commonplace."
2201	6	a	The movie version of Jackie Kallen is Faust meets Erin Brockovich in a Lifetime movie coproduced by ESPN. If it sounds like a hodgepodge, that's because it is.
2202	9	a	All the whiny point-scoring is such an explicit appeal for audience sympathy that the dialogue feels derived from a malnourished stand-up routine.
2203	7	a	The filmmakers have wildly miscalculated the chemistry these real-life lovers generate on film.
2204	6	a	Despite a few clever insights and twists, it's neither good nor distinctive enough to rise above the level of generic romantic comedy.
2205	1	a	John Carter is an instant classic... Disney should be ashamed of themselves for treating Mars like a red-headed step planet.
2206	0	a	[VIDEO ESSAY] Blade Runner is one of the most enigmatic yet problematic science fiction films ever made. 
2207	0	a	No Country for Old Men is imbued with a dry, minimalist, almost crude style and forms a dark and violent universe that reveals the horror and moral rot rooted in American society. [Full Review in Spanish] 
2208	6	a	It's a magic trick that's all showmanship and craft, but lacking true whimsy, ultimately failing the audience.
2209	5	a	If you were a fan of the popular trend-setting TV show, this film should suit you just fine.
2210	3	a	Crimson Peak supersedes homage and becomes something new; a re-original.
2211	6	a	Letters to God is certainly watchable and may offer comfort to Christians in the audience. But its appeal will be limited, no matter how professional it looks.
2212	4	a	A realistic apocalypse where the deadlier things are what one can touch and be exposed to everyday. In the case of It Comes at Night, it is the reflection of oneself.
2213	9	a	Lumbers in circles before crashing into a surprisingly sadistic finale.
2214	4	a	It's not the most poignant or ground-breaking coming of age tale, but Paper Towns' gentle nature and noble intentions make it a respectable one.
2215	3	a	Quite clever, and the fact that you never really know what the film is going to toss your way is part of the fun. A solidly goofy romp.
2216	5	a	Watching Meet the Fockers is like attending a big, potentially wild and funny party in which the guests pretend to have fun.
2217	4	a	With a couple of feature films on her resume, Selma is the film that will probably take off director Ava DuVernay's career. [Full review in Spanish]
2218	10	a	Crossover might have its heart in the right place, but its brain is somewhere else all together.
2219	5	a	Complete rehash of every cliche we have repeatedly seen in just about every single YA dystopian teen nightmare movies. 
2220	5	a	It's one more cheesy, broadly played, poorly paced, instantly forgettable August action movie.
2221	9	a	Look for Red Planet to crash as resoundingly at the box office as its heroes do on Mars.
2222	4	a	The result is hardly fantastic, but it is quite a lot of fun.
2223	4	a	A crisp and exciting police operation at the start of the movie and an equally exciting shootout at the end suggest that writer/director James Mangold has a nice touch with action. But Mangold's heart is in pregnant pauses and meaningful stares.
2224	4	a	As a hipster rom-com about people trying to shake off their pasts to make present-day connections, it's pretty satisfying.
2225	1	a	In keeping with the Smith rules, the movie is irreverent, self-referential, twisted, cheap and tasteless. And, of course, I mean that as the highest compliment.
2226	2	a	Not rocket science or much of a rocker. There are plenty of laughs and that's especially true if you know anything about sheep. A great cast has a lot of fun with this one.
2227	3	a	Hidden codes, secret meanings and mixed messages pulse through the reliable, old-fashioned, buzzing copper wires of this true-life British period drama.
2228	4	a	The film ... presents classic moral-condundrum drama: What would you have done to survive? The problem with the film is whether these ambitions, laudable in themselves, justify a theatrical simulation of the death camp of Auschwitz II-Birkenau.
2229	3	a	Much of the success of this film lies in the excellent performances of the ensemble. [Full Review in Spanish] 
2230	3	a	It will more than reward your investment of time, money and popcorn.
2231	6	a	"Barnyard"" doesn't stink. But it's not the cream of the crop, either."
2232	2	a	Gets off to a shaky start but gradually pulls together into a genuinely haunting parable of teenage alienation.
2233	3	a	should inspire current and future generations to explore Keats and other Romantic poets
2234	3	a	Just the right combination of fantasy and comedy.
2235	6	a	The Green Hornet is the usual numbing, postmodern pastiche -- which is ironic, since the premise is supposed to be retro, a throwback to a simpler, less synthetic analog age done in digital style.
2236	1	a	Friendship is a timeworn theme of family-friendly films, but Ralph Breaks the Internet handles it with nuance and insight that feels vital in these divisive times when differences of opinion and personality too often lead to broken bonds.
2237	0	a	A damning documentary which makes a convincing case that neither the federal government nor the corporate elite could care less about the plight of the working class.
2238	6	a	How disappointing that Land of the Dead is a familiar rehashing of what Romero already covered in Day of the Dead.
2239	3	a	A good-natured, end-of- the-world B-movie, written and directed by Thom Eberhardt, a new film maker whose sense of humor augments rather than upstages the mechanics of the melodrama.
2240	3	a	"Director David Bowers supplies just enough heart and more than enough humor to make ""Astro Boy"" an agreeable entertainment."
2241	3	a	Timely as it is funny.
2242	2	a	Funny in the most squirm-inducing of ways.
2243	0	a	Innovative, many layered and prevocative but very, very dated.
2244	3	a	The music, cinematography, costumes, sets and overall design are flawless, and the film as a whole is utterly exquisite. Maybe a little too exquisite-Carol is so painstaking, I felt like I was watching it from behind a velvet rope.
2245	3	a	Is Final Fantasy decent sci-fi? Yes, more than decent.
2246	5	a	Someone should have arrested Wimmer for being a common-sense offender when he first typed the script.
2247	1	a	The Curious Case of Benjamin Button sighs with longing and simmers with intrigue while investigating the philosophical conundrums and emotional paradoxes of its protagonist's condition.
2248	4	a	The ensuing war of the worlds is waged with weapons as fearsome as a bubble blower, a skateboard, and a sort of anti-gravity grenade that, frankly, looks like a lot of fun.
2249	7	a	The heist goes awry, but not as badly as the movie.
2250	5	a	Dolly does Chicago -- and not much else.
2251	4	a	Casting [Seth] Rogen as a crimefighting hero may sound dubious, until you see how the film understands and embraces the disconnect.
2252	1	a	Selma, the latest in a long string of strong biopics out over the last year, deserves your undivided attention.
2253	10	a	Daddy Day Camp is a perfect family film for the blind and deaf.
2254	4	a	Its impressive images of crematorium chimney fires and stacks of dead bodies are undermined by the movie's presentation, which is way too stagy.
2255	2	a	The funny stuff outweighs the slower parts - it mostly delivers super hero entertainment.
2256	3	a	Who else but the Brits would make their action heroes a bunch of complete losers?
2257	4	a	Provides moments of genuine emotion and pathos, be you a man or woman, parent or childless.
2258	3	a	Overall, try as it might, this isn't as good as a Scorsese film, but it's still a compelling picture.
2259	5	a	Unaccompanied Minors is packed with talent in front of and behind the camera, which makes its bland mediocrity even more unforgivable.
2260	2	a	You might call it a morality play, if there were any morality to speak of at play.
2261	5	a	"What Ewan McGregor's ""American Pastoral"" does to the Philip Roth novel it adapts is the cinematic equivalent of unslinking a Slinky. "
2262	2	a	An absolutely bizarre film that has a crescendo of naughty humor with one of the most outrageous endings of recent cinema. [Full review in Spanish]
2263	6	a	As it stands, the flick is too good-natured and too clean to offer audiences anything more than a mild afternoon distraction.
2264	4	a	Is Gibson trying somehow to shock us into believing?
2265	3	a	I never watched an episode of Veronica Mars when it was on TV, but you don't need to be a die hard fan to like the film. 
2266	5	a	As a film it is nothing but a long third act with no story and, most importantly, NO character development for anyone other than Pilate.
2267	6	a	The defining characteristics of The Tourist are its overt efforts to emphasize that Angelina Jolie is beautiful and that Johnny Depp is a 'regular guy.'
2268	4	a	The actors, particularly Seyfried and Redgrave, help make the movie's romantic spirit contagious.
2269	6	a	Contrived and hokey where Austen's work is effortless and romantic...
2270	2	a	Romantic comedy is to cinema what hot dogs are to cuisine - the question is only whether it's been prepared decently. And this one has.
2271	3	a	This poignant, albeit overly poetic documentary claims to capture the slain actor/rapper 'in his own words.' That aspect of it doesn't totally work, but plenty else does.
2272	3	a	There won't be a dry eye in the house. Just sublime.
2273	4	a	The movie plays better than its predecessor to audiences that are not turned off by human emotions.
2274	4	a	Ultimately a tribute to the Power of Cute Pooches; despite all the film's shortcomings, the dogs deliver genuine laughs and prove to be thoroughly engaging protagonists.
2275	4	a	"The film asks welcome questions about what price we should be willing to pay for ""the good life,"" but ultimately it can't close the deal."
2276	3	a	This kind of maturity and intelligence is all too infrequent in mainstream cinema -- let's hope it's not another six years until [director] Lawrence's next film.
2277	2	a	Just know your littles well to avoid unnecessary trauma. It would've been too much for little me, so proceed with caution. Overall, The House with a Clock in Its Walls is a great pre-Halloween watch to get you in the creepy mood.
2278	0	a	It's fearless, yet utterly controlled, terribly moving and beautifully terrifying. 
2279	2	a	There are some good laughs in this nice adaptation of the original cartoon.
2280	1	a	Blisteringly hilarious from start to finish, a relationship comedy built on sturdy emotional conflict and not a series of flimsy gags.
2281	3	a	A lovable old-school musical.
2282	3	a	McTeer and the transporting music hold you in thrall.
2283	6	a	There were moments that needed some explanation and characters that needed a quite a bit of fleshing out. But it was violent and fun and since that's why I played the game, I left the theater satisfied.
2284	8	a	This story is best left on the page.
2285	2	a	The movie is both exhilarating and depressing. The trouble is, I can't figure out which is more important.
2286	9	a	Not everything needs to be art, of course, so here goes your proof.
2287	4	a	No one will deny that it looks gorgeous, and that the cast performs with raw emotional intensity.
2288	2	a	The most unromantic take on the Wild West since John Wayne in The Searchers vowed to kill his niece.
2289	5	a	Man of the Year jerks unexpectedly from laughs to suspense to drama to satire. More to the point, the film doesn't really seem to have a point; it offers a parade of mixed messages.
2290	6	a	While Tupac: Resurrection includes some never-before- seen family photos and performance footage, and excerpts from the late rapper's journals, it offers little in the way of new information or insight into the rapper's world.
2291	2	a	...ultimately a slightly tarnished treasure; with the combined talent of its production team, it could have been great, but because of its clumsy writing style it has to settle for just being good.
2292	6	a	It's as disquieting as it is unsatisfying, a slog through gender issues, surgery and violence - sexual and otherwise.
2293	5	a	The movie is devoid of laughs, thanks to James Bridges' characteristically humorless direction.
2294	3	a	There has always been something likable about the Marquis de Sade.
2295	5	a	Forster keeps us from drifting off with inventive camerawork; in this case, that's like saying a hideous suit has well-stitched lapels.
2296	5	a	It's a rockabilly space romp, often very bad but usually a visual treat.
2297	3	a	The film-makers have set out to tell us a yarn and they have succeeded admirably. Celebrate a film that will enhance rainy bank-holiday weekends for decades to come.
2298	5	a	The abundance of talent gathered for Meet the Fockers is sadly shortchanged by the unimaginative script and directorial laissez faire.
2299	4	a	The more they replay the story, the more you realize that there really wasn't all that much to see in the first place.
2300	2	a	Hitchcock is at its best when not taking its subject seriously, when you can detect Hopkins' tongue firmly jabbed into his phony cheeks.
2301	2	a	Beatifully capturing the era, the acting by Cumberbatch and Knightley is very good, but the well-directed story doesn't need the couple of trite plot devices that diminish the end product.
2302	6	a	Nothing quite clicks in this movie. Nothing really sounds right, or feels right. It just... doesn't work.
2303	4	a	Killer Joe, packed with miserable stereotypes doing miserable things with no sense of a higher purpose, plays like a dramatized version of The Jerry Springer Show. 
2304	4	a	Considerably more entertaining than most of what passes for a 'mindless horror flick' these days.
2305	3	a	A tense piece of narrative restraint that makes its bullets and death as scary as they should be.
2306	4	a	Intiguing, but slow-moving Albert Lewin film
2307	0	a	Embrace of the Serpent is the type of film we're always searching for, yet seems so obvious once we've found it.
2308	4	a	The filmmakers insufficiently stir the lumpy metaphors, chief among them that for animals, as for humans, there is a difference between cages and enclosures.
2309	8	a	Ever gone into a movie knowing exactly what's going to happen and still been scared by it? Yeah, me neither.
2310	3	a	While movies like I Robot are aimed at the brainless summer crowd. Serenity is designed for basement dwelling geeks just aching to find meaning in the mythos.
2311	4	a	The new Barry Levinson comedy Man of the Year is thirty minutes of brilliance followed by an additional ninety of disappointment.
2312	9	a	This is one Columbus who should have stayed at home. A real loser.
2313	5	a	Rumor is Ms. Foster's picky about scripts. It's an interesting notion, but it doesn't quite explain the existence of Flightplan
2314	8	a	There's no real magic here.
2315	4	a	Bright Days is fairly lightweight stuff but Ardant's performance lends it conviction and poignancy.
2316	6	a	Tea For Two is saddled with a ridiculous plot that only gets worse as it gets acted out.
2317	6	a	Friends may not let friends die alone, but bogus philosophizing is apparently business as usual.
2318	3	a	Exotic and evocative, surreal in its primal eloquence and spirituality.
2319	2	a	It's an entertaining warm-up, a few bits of brilliance packed in disposable kiddie fluff.
2320	3	a	Great, but kids may need historical context.
2321	2	a	A truly grim film. Super grim. Did I mention its grimness?
2322	3	a	Endearing it definitely is, so much so that it's easy to overlook the simplicity, and the sly confidence trick that gets played on us.
2323	5	a	The thrill of the hunt is long gone
2324	9	a	Trying to explain the origins of the iconic character, the film focuses on his formative years, but it suffocates due to poor direction, somber tone, simplistic pyschology and unconvincing turn by Gaspard Ulliel; it's the worst movie of the franchise.
2325	4	a	An audacious idea in need of a more adventurous script, taking this madness to the next level of brain-bleeding humor and commentary, securing itself as both an inspired farce and a Samurai-sharp inspection of sheeple culture.
2326	2	a	Depp transforms a potentially repellent character into another glittering portrait in a gallery of lovable rogues ...
2327	5	a	pretentious cinematography and gritty realism aside, there's not a whole lot in this torture chamber to be passionate about
2328	4	a	[A] beautiful and lush but thematically flawed and even disturbing portrait of a prisoner who adopts the reality of her captors and of a love stunted by captivity.
2329	0	a	Cosmopolis is almost certainly some kind of masterpiece, but I have to admit it's probably not for everyone.
2330	6	a	It doesn't matter how many extra months the director spends creating impressive action scenes. If the audience is not emotionally invested in the fate of the heroes, no amount of explosions will make them care.
2331	9	a	"Yes, ""The Cloverfield Paradox"" is bad, really bad. In fact, it's far and away the worst movie of the ""Cloverfield"" universe."
2332	5	a	A predictable, emotionally unengaging, and occasionally corny story.
2333	6	a	Tumbleweeds literally blow between the laughs of this lackluster comedy.
2334	4	a	[Director] Lawrence certainly knows how to bait his audience with intriguing characters.
2335	2	a	Those who know the story, particularly those who lived through the events, would likely find the film on the dry side -- as I did.
2336	3	a	If you're looking for a smart, nuanced look at de Sade and what might have happened at Picpus, Sade is your film.
2337	9	a	Not even Sean Penn's grunts can save this stinker. 
2338	3	a	"A depressing soap opera of a film, ""The Other Boleyn Girl"" makes early English history, at least for women, look like Hades itself. And maybe it was. After all, a woman's reputation and worth did not depend on so much on her education, personality and goo"
2339	4	a	Spall and his co-star Rose Byrne are two incredibly likeable comic performers, and Dan Mazer's cheerfully abrasive film capitalises on that quality to tell a story that might otherwise have been too sour to swallow.
2340	2	a	Yimou is a masterful director.
2341	0	a	More than any previous non-documentary Holocaust movie, this one convinces through the accumulation of such detail.
2342	3	a	Into the Wild is a literal free spirit of a motion picture, but it also remains a poignant, tragic, and unforgettable tale of misplaced human desire.
2343	9	a	Madonna never emerges as a plausible human being in the movie; she's more like a spokeswoman for a video on alternative parenting lifestyles.
2344	5	a	Bird and the Pixar whizzes do what they do excellently; you just wish they were doing something else.
2345	4	a	t's the strong Star Wars/geek-centric nature of the film that helps it succeed.
2346	4	a	It has fun with the characters, the dilemmas, the imagery, and source of inspiration. Without genuine depth, however, the film will have a hard time reeling in a widespread audience.
2347	4	a	Clearly, huge tankers of disbelief must be suspended in a sea of goodwill to get into the spirit of the film.
2348	7	a	A one-joke movie, stretched to the limit.
2349	2	a	Unconventional rom-com that is really neither but gets by on the charisma of the cast including Whiterspoon and especially Rudd who can do no wrong.
2350	4	a	The film's production values are almost enough to make the film's monumental shortcomings worth overlooking. But only almost.
2351	8	a	Key revelation is that Shore is a bitter, unpleasant, petty, humourless little man--and that his stoned weasel song and dance isn't doing that great a job of hiding it.
2352	4	a	You may not always like Eastwood's films, but you seldom get downright bored by them.
2353	6	a	Feeling long at slightly over two hours, The Infiltrator is a patchwork of elements that tantalize us without satisfying.
2354	3	a	Nebraska'' has enough good lines, scenes and performances to make it worth your while, as well as a sufficiently upbeat ending to qualify it as holiday entertainment.
2355	10	a	Madonna's incompetent performance secured her reputation as a no-talent actress...and, to date, she still hasn't been able to shake that reputation.
2356	3	a	The history may have been narratively scrunched, but it's all the true lives of some powerful and unfortunate people. Very lush.
2357	5	a	The film begins as an unyielding look at a battered wife, and ends as another one of those thrillers where the villain toys with his victim and the audience.
2358	5	a	It's as if Hanks and co-writer Nia Vardalos assumed that getting everyone in one place would be enough, and didn't think much further.
2359	2	a	It often feels like there are a few different movies going on within Ixcanul at the same time, but they're all well constructed enough to make it come together as a mostly cohesive whole.
2360	4	a	Surprisingly enjoyable, if not predictable.
2361	3	a	A salient spin on responsibility, race, and going the distance.
2362	4	a	[A] dazzling, busy, fundamentally tedious movie ...
2363	3	a	Xtro may be morbid, unsettling, and even upsetting--it pushes upon boundaries and then crosses them--but it's a bonafide original in the genre.
2364	3	a	The Lazarus Effect doesn't exactly break new ground, but it nonetheless finds plenty to relish in the mouldering bits it stitches together as it gives classic themes about death, life and the soul a literal and figurative shot in the arm.
2365	5	a	The film sputters and stalls and winds up behaving like the worst sort of oldster - passing gas and pretending to be deep.
2366	3	a	The Godfather II of family films.
2367	4	a	It's a shame to see Peter Jackson treading water when there are so many new cinematic horizons worth exploring.
2368	9	a	A badly animated, dispassionate and irresolute mess.
2369	7	a	This is one of those films, like last week's Whip It and so many others of late, that looks like it was a lot fun to make. It's just not all that much fun to watch.
2370	6	a	Very little about Identity Thief is original. After a brief introduction that leads to Sandy and Diana travelling across the country together, viewers are saddled with a story that's essentially a road movie with an Odd Couple twist.
2371	5	a	There are some funny moments in 'A Million Ways to Die in the West,' and a few of them are inspired, but you just keep waiting for it to find its stride and it never does.
2372	4	a	Strives to be a one-way ticket into the mind of a serial killer, but it takes too many detours into TV movie-of-the-week territory.
2373	1	a	The sharply written, potty-mouthed comedy isn't all-too dark, but the lightness is tinged with a sense of realistic edginess that makes the story feel whole and relatable. 
2374	2	a	Thanks mostly to fine work by its great cast, Valkyrie is not a loss and has some riveting moments, but it's not the scintillating wartime thriller it could have been.
2375	3	a	For all its madcap whimsy, the film still manages to pack a much more powerful intellectual and moral punch than, say, your average Hollywood blockbuster.
2376	0	a	Although films of this flavor depend primarily on their comic timing to win over an audience, director Joel Zwick finds other outlets of brilliance...
2377	3	a	Described as a thriller, those who were around at the time may have short memories of what happened or never knew the entire story, will now have a chance to see it on the big screen
2378	4	a	It's really amazing how much pathos is generated while there's nothing on screen but violence and mass panic.
2379	3	a	The remake everyone's been talking about doesn't disappoint.
2380	4	a	Entertaining.
2381	5	a	A purely visual exercise...unless you're willing to be satisfied with a handsome exterior, you won't find Bonello's film very involving.
2382	4	a	From the moment he appears on screen, McConaughey seems physically and behaviorally transformed from what we've seen in the past.
2383	1	a	Despite the snake slither-swimming through the bars of a flooded cellblock, the injured alligator and the iguanas that seem to be crooning Johnny Adams' 'Release Me,' star Nicolas Cage may be the most reptilian presence here...
2384	5	a	Earnest and predictable, Crossover deserves more than the horselaughs that will probably greet it in theaters -- but not a lot more.
2385	3	a	The Bourne Identity has all the necessary components of the genre, and deploys them well.
2386	6	a	In the place of consistent psychological tension, we are saddled with shoot-outs, chases, and fight scenes.
2387	3	a	A crowd-pleasing oddball comedy.
2388	4	a	As obvious and predictable as this story might be, it still works - in large part because we care about the human beings inhabiting this motion picture.
2389	7	a	It's like Lost in the middle of the desert but without the smart mystery, compelling characters and strange monster.
2390	7	a	A silly courtroom thriller that comes dangerously close to remaking [Joel] Schumacher's A Time to Kill.
2391	3	a	The structure of Hancock is a bold risk that supplies more storytelling ambition than your more typical summer popcorn blockbuster.
2392	3	a	Silver Linings Playbook is Cooper and Lawrence's show.
2393	4	a	OK Redford caper flick directed by Peter Yates.
2394	3	a	A few extemporaneous Lord of the Rings elements distract from The Hobbit storyline but Jackson has presented a captivating and exciting return to Middle-earth.
2395	0	a	THE definition of escapist summer movie and a triumph for director Spielberg. It is a stunner and a half.
2396	4	a	Lee's movie captures the mellow mood and mud-caked faces of the crowd but misses the reverberations of the counterculture revolution that brought the great unwashed to that farm.
2397	6	a	Photo-realism can only go so far when so little thought has gone into the story the 'synthespians' are acting out. 
2398	5	a	But if you like living dead movies, and there are lots of you out there, you'll like this one too.
2399	5	a	I can't remember one witty line or one moment of great acting.
2400	7	a	The Other Boleyn Girl pretends to be a serious historical romance, but it's really just a bodice-ripper, a cheap Harlequin paperback dressed up in frilly clothes.
2401	3	a	It's a bit heavy-handed, but ultimately a rewarding watch.
2402	6	a	This is as formulaic a comedy as humanly possible. Smith's charm and his collaberation with James produce enough laughs to save it from terminal derivativity.
2403	1	a	Sofia has almost surpassed her dad.
2404	6	a	...the comedy never tried to stretch beyond being common.
2405	5	a	Vaughn manages to grab more screen time to showcase his charisma but do we really need to watch his midlife crisis unfold over the course of nearly two hours?
2406	6	a	The characters are tedious, as are the fussy performances of Bale and Beckinsale.
2407	6	a	Passes the time, but undoutedly one for the little 'uns.
2408	4	a	First-time feature director Steven Quale has brought this anemic franchise back to life, with an unexpected infusion of humor and energy.
2409	5	a	The megawatt pairing of Tom Hanks and Julia Roberts brings precious little sparkle to this romantic comedy.
2410	3	a	Craig has settled into a well-suited, grim-reaper role. Even when James flirts and trysts, his creased face suggests an unmovable weight.
2411	3	a	Plot details can be scattershot, but it succeeds thanks to an outrageously comical deconstruction of Hollywood Westerns and an appealing cast of characters.
2412	3	a	The movie stands out for two reasons: Simon Pegg is hilarious and Edgar Wright directs with flair.
2413	5	a	It gears up to go important places but never arrives.
2414	0	a	Like Hannah and Her Sisters it strikes a perfect balance between structure, pathos, and sheer laughs.
2415	4	a	Engaging Jackie Chan movie for older teens and up.
2416	0	a	'The Artist' paints a glorious picture of old Hollyood.
2417	2	a	If this story isn't as conceptually immediate or clearly executed as its predecessor, it makes a lot of sharp points about male-female double standards, aging, and the acceleration of intergenerational conflicts. It's also very funny.
2418	0	a	Clockers leaves you with a sense of aching sadness, a regretful melancholy for the lives that have been blasted and the wrong decisions that have been made. Once again, Spike Lee has done the right thing.
2419	6	a	[Nonfans] will be admitted to the clubhouse, but will not be made to feel welcome.
2420	4	a	With a movie that looks this great, why is del Toro holding his narrative back in the throes of convention? It is not a sound impulse.
2421	4	a	Somewhere in here, there is a simple, powerful story. If only Wright and Grant had been able to find it.
2422	4	a	An uneven and fairly forgettable comedy that produces only sporadic laughter.
2423	5	a	A smug, academic thesis on the evils of capitalism, Cosmopolis is as exciting as someone reading you the entire book in a flat, unvarying monotone.
2424	4	a	Bee Movie doesn't touch the bar raised so high by Pixar, but it creates a little buzz of its own.
2425	3	a	The topics of American Dreamz are very broad, but the targeting is often lasered.
2426	4	a	You're not likely to get drug jokes, slapstick, a dildo-loving toddler and positive gender attitudes in any other above-average comedy sequel...
2427	2	a	This Cold War thriller may not have the most complicated story, but it's curiously effective and has been been surprisingly influential, a nice companion piece to The Manchurian Candidate.
2428	3	a	"The World's End"" one of those bittersweet coming-home films that show how difficult it is to really, well, go home. Because it's never the same."
2429	3	a	The most subtle comic adaptation you'll see all year.
2430	10	a	Just not good.
2431	4	a	You have to be patient with the movie, but the payoff is good.
2432	6	a	Larry Crowne'' isn't a movie for adults. It's a movie for adults who don't like things with screens and keyboards.
2433	4	a	"Die Hard"" meets ""Boyz N'The Hood"". Audaciously enthralling"
2434	3	a	For a film where so many people seem, in varying degrees, culpable, Marsh indulges in very little finger-pointing. He doesn't need to. The indignities are hiding in plain sight.
2435	3	a	Silence and stillness, as well as the restrained desire of its lovers, are given their due. After the clatter and rush of the summer flicks, patience is demanded but also rewarded.
2436	1	a	This is never the kind of movie where they're going to fall in love. That she even smiles is a breakthrough.
2437	7	a	Let's hope the follow-ups turn out to be better -- they could hardly be worse.
2438	6	a	A decaffeinated and imbalanced War of the Roses where the occasional funny riff from Vaughn attempts to distract us from material which is far more familiar than he believes.
2439	0	a	Genius. Christopher Lee. Genius.
2440	5	a	You could take the kids to see it this summer holiday and avoid an hour or so of rain - or rent the DVD later on. Inoffensive.
2441	3	a	The actors save the day.
2442	4	a	There's blackly witty ingenuity here without too much misanthropic sadism, and a genuinely neat chronological twist that I didn't see coming, despite one conspicuous clue.
2443	3	a	Although Freddy Heflin is no Rocky, Stallone does an admirable job of bringing him across as a real person we can sympathize with.
2444	2	a	As with many modern thrillers the actual plot, once it comes to light, is highly implausible, there are a few too many turns towards the end and the climax errs towards the anti-climatic. That being said, it's well put together and entertainingly moody.
2445	0	a	Every time I revisit it, it has a new gift for me.
2446	2	a	Evil, even evil that doesn't even realize how evil it is, has rarely looked so everyday.
2447	4	a	This willfully eccentric tale about teenage boys in suburban Ohio fleeing their families to live in the deep woods plays like an erratic comic revue slapped together at theater camp.
2448	6	a	An opportunity to wallow in grimy nostalgia seems to be its sole purpose.
2449	4	a	Amiable, kid-oriented slapstick...
2450	1	a	Typically, Burton's storytelling is sometimes erratic, but his emphasis on humanizing marginal characters -- a project that seems central to his artistic agenda -- is as strong as ever.
2451	4	a	Tender and contemplative, but as it meanders to its not-quite conclusion, it misses a ripe opportunity to give a stronger voice to a character the likes of which isn't often heard.
2452	4	a	The Church of Al Gore gets a surprising close-up in First Reformed.
2453	4	a	It's eye candy with snorkels and fins.
2454	0	a	I'm blown away by just the construction of the scenes, and by all of the effects that have been incorporated to make everything move fluidly; and there's also this charming imperfection to the animation that just makes it so gorgeous.
2455	3	a	Shows that the deconstruction of the Western began long before Unforgiven
2456	3	a	Winning family film that's clever in the best kind of offhanded way.
2457	2	a	Is it schmaltzy? A little. Is it good anyway? Yes. It's not trying to reinvent the wheel but it understands what it is and that the best place to put its focus is not the rugby field.
2458	4	a	Cara is a bit of a Lindsay Lohan lookalike on the big screen, but she shows promise and can now add acting to her CV ahead of what will inevitably be her first album, first art show, first everything.
2459	6	a	The fun parts of this movie actually occur when the two leads are not with each other but in their respective corners preparing for the next round.
2460	3	a	"The Ring"" is pretty much an English-language copy of the film that inspired it, and it carries the same strengths and flaws."
2461	5	a	The film should have been about Payne getting addicted to drugs, having a good heart, but doing really bad things to search for the man who murdered his family--not this mess.
2462	2	a	Good character development and the great on-screen chemistry between Smith and Bridget Moynahan also give this movie a big boost.
2463	0	a	What emerges most memorably is its sense of absolute conviction, never more palpable than in the final fantasy sequence that removes Jesus from the cross and creates for him the life of an ordinary man.
2464	4	a	The only IMAX-style flick I wished was a bit longer.
2465	10	a	On the big screen is the only way one can, ahem, appreciate this gaudy, flat-out bizarre exercise in cinematic fragmentation.
2466	4	a	The story is inspiring enough to make up for a more or less routine telling. 
2467	1	a	"Lost in Translation"" is one of the year's best films, an intelligent, beautifully rendered mood piece that features Bill Murray at his absolute best."
2468	3	a	...meant as a cautionary tale, but it could be taken as just another tabloid exploitation.
2469	1	a	Chris Columbus makes the novel's transformation into a big-budget feature look effortless, and the film's darker tone is more satisfying than that of the first, a somewhat forced happy ending notwithstanding.
2470	3	a	Painfully poignant, earnest, sad, witty and beautiful. Pretty depressing up until the final, uplifting scene.
2471	5	a	You have to wonder whether it was really all worth it.
2472	7	a	This is one of the limpest, laziest, and most worthless comedies I've seen in a while. And I see lots of 'em.
2473	1	a	Consistently engaging, funny, and touching. This is the kind of picture in which two hours of running time whiz by in a flash.
2474	3	a	This is a bluesy, emotional journey that casts a powerful spell.
2475	4	a	Still as high-octane the second time around, even if it's firing on a few different cylinders.
2476	1	a	Van Sant has made his best film in many years. I didn't realize it until a second viewing. These things sometimes happen, especially if the first encounter was in the middle of a film festival.
2477	5	a	This Western doesn't have anything terribly wrong with it -- terrific cast, fine story and acting, appealing scenery -- but somehow it just never sparks to life. 
2478	2	a	Stylish, full throttle, nobody's-pretending-this-is-art summer movie fun.
2479	6	a	This is how reductive the debate [about science and religion] has become, and I Origins buys into that insulting simplicity while feigning to be above it.
2480	6	a	It's bad enough that the film's unimaginative narrative can barely hold our attention, but we have the added distraction of seeing the estimable Harris, Winger and Woodard frittering away their talents playing banal, cardboard characters.
2481	10	a	Stanton's screenwriting skills are, on this evidence, slightly below those of George Lucas, so there's plenty of clunky exposition and such inadvertent laugh-lines as: 'I would lay down my life for Helium.'
2482	6	a	It's rare for a biopic to deliver so little insight into its subject.
2483	3	a	This in-depth study of important developments of the computer industry should make it required viewing in university computer science departments for years to come.
2484	5	a	Unlike Pretty Woman, and most other successful romances, we have absolutely NO reason to understand why EITHER of these empty vessels would EVER find themselves attracted to the other.
2485	3	a	Invictus is a powerful and moving story.
2486	0	a	I Heart Huckabees is a multi-layered existential mind trip...The eclectic ensemble cast is nothing short of radiant as they dance in the words
2487	3	a	I mean it only in the best sense when I say that My Big Fat Greek Wedding is a really nice movie.
2488	1	a	It's a potent blend: a psychedelic post-colonial pilgrimage with shades of Glauber Rocha, Werner Herzog and Alejandro Jodorowsky.
2489	6	a	"Clock"" feels like a movie at war with itself."
2490	1	a	From the opening, adrenalin-pumping prison bus escape to a heart-pounding car theft aboard a fast-moving train, Fast Five throws it down from the jump.
2491	4	a	Pastoral, however, belongs to its two leading women. Connelly shows enormous range... Fanning hauntingly suggests a living ghost, a leper who only occasionally sees sunlight.
2492	3	a	What makes Knocked Up stand out is not just the fact that the jokes are side-splittingly funny but that nearly everything that happens to the couple rings so true. 
2493	6	a	Mostly an amusing exercise in black vernacular, searching for a point.
2494	9	a	This sequel is just a string of lame slapstick gags, where Steve Martin acts handicapped, makes a fool of himself and gets a wetsuit stuck up his butt.
2495	4	a	A comfortable movie.
2496	6	a	King's Ransom must have been funny for somebody, but I think the rest of us will be underwhelmed. 
2497	4	a	It's rarely as playful or funny or loose or hip as it hopes.
2498	6	a	Queasy, anxiety-driven and forgettable...I'd advise grounding it.
2499	3	a	Director Dan Verete uses his camera as the metaphoric needle, and his cast in each segment as his thread, to form a sweeping tapestry of mis-explanation and contention.
2500	3	a	David O. Russell's latest buzz film straddles a fine line between farce and kitchen-sink drama before settling into a groove that gets under one's skin.
2501	1	a	Michel Hazanavicius' spellbinding love-letter to silent cinema is a masterclass of inscrutable production design, top-notch physical comedy, and a postmodern sensibility which never descends into a rose-tintedly overzealous adulation of the era.
2502	6	a	If this film really epitomizes the way that teens talk and act ... then I seriously fear for the future of this country.
2503	4	a	Schrader's chief influence here, as in many of his other films, is the great French director Robert Bresson... But Bresson's spare stylistics achieved a sublimity while Schrader's, though intermittently powerful, too often feel schematic.
2504	3	a	Killer Joe spins a lot of dumb hick behavior into a wellspring of comedy and plot twists, recalling Raising Arizona's colorful vernacular while turning a simple contract job into a complicated web of family betrayals.
2505	4	a	If you can grasp the gist of Firefly's intricate political machinations, then the flight's somewhat enjoyable. 
2506	3	a	"More than a narrative, the film is a study in visual ways to convey the ""swimmy,"" unreal sensations of love at first sight."
2507	6	a	Man of the Year sets its audience up to ponder the unthinkable, loses its resolve and congeals into reassuring kitsch.
2508	5	a	At least it's better than some of the earlier Exorcist sequels. 
2509	3	a	Jack Cardiff's superb Technicolor cinematography looks as beautiful as Gardner and that's substantially the reason the film has stood the test of time.
2510	5	a	"At best it's a piece of fan service designed to explain why the ""Cloverfield Universe"" exists-and even then, it's kind of slipshod and lazy."
2511	2	a	Maybe it is time to move on from the genre mash-up, but this is a thundering way to go out.
2512	4	a	Well, it's a more fun trip to Rio than Rio. As the reckless flailing of a lot of meatheads, Fast Five is essentially a food fight with sloppy Joes.
2513	3	a	Begins warily as a mild chucker and then reveals itself to be an increasingly clever and very funny appreciation of a bee's existence.
2514	5	a	...old-fashioned, nonstop violence from beginning to end, with subtlety out the window.
2515	2	a	There are laughs here, some resulting from sharp satirical observations and some from gross-out gags.
2516	4	a	Director Guillermo del Toro's unique visual style is on display but the story is predictable, the characters are flat, and the supernatural elements are red herrings.
2517	7	a	Even though Line's legacy manages to shine through, instilling audiences with a heartfelt message, a less paint-by-numbers film was left in the locker room.
2518	1	a	Laugh out loud funny with bravura performances by Melissa McCarthy and Jason Bateman and a terrific supporting cast.
2519	4	a	The film engages with the divergent paths taken, linked by childhood friendship and a mewling kitten, but a third act event is presented so abruptly it confuses the viewer until it rebounds somewhat with a satisfying closure.
2520	3	a	With its third outing, the Final Destination series surprisingly gets a second wind.
2521	0	a	There's an inherent wisdom to Inherent Vice that escapes the groovy episodes, farcical humor and pea soup atmosphere, and transforms a nearly perfect piece of entertainment into something truly powerful.
2522	5	a	There's not a whole lot to like about Welcome to Mooseport, and, considering how lively real politics can be these days, you're likely to get more entertainment from watching two hours of CSPAN.
2523	4	a	Starts out as a raunchy teen comedy, slips into nature-epic mode, then adds a romantic triangle and finally finds a comfort zone in family-sitcom land.
2524	3	a	Surprisingly sophisticated riff on animated fairy-tale movie cliches.
2525	5	a	Good with mechanics, bad with people, the film moves its one-dimensional characters around like stick figures in the service of a story whose outcome is hardly in doubt.
2526	2	a	It is Depp, however, who really nails this thing by simply blending in with all the other voice talent and characters and not reverting to the oversized Captain Jack Sparrow swagger.
2527	3	a	A wondrous, true-to-life comedy.
2528	5	a	Whatever ambitions this romantic comedy might have had, they were never realized.
2529	3	a	The film's structure, however stifling, is filled with gorgeous imagery and nuanced symbolism.
2530	3	a	May inspire a shrug from most viewers, but it has lingered with me, growing sillier and more charming each time I think about it.
2531	4	a	Director Joe Wright may not always be able to resist self-indulgence, but credit the filmmaker for tending to the story with a pace and tone that meld commerciality with an art-house mentality.
2532	3	a	Not one of their very best, but adorable. It's comforting to know there'll always be an Aardman. 
2533	3	a	Say what you will about Verhoeven's penchant for extravagant theatrics, when he's not yanking the arms off people or putting bullets in their forehead, he tells a good story.
2534	3	a	It's a straightforward, unpretentious joy, and one of the most purely enjoyable films I've seen in some time.
2535	5	a	Incessantly shrieky ...
2536	3	a	Two strangers quickly fall in love, discuss big ideas.
2537	6	a	Ultimately, [Aniston's] Justine Last ends up as the poster girl for unnecessary self-pity and relentless self-doubt. Unfortunately, this makes her a needlessly naive bad girl in a preachy and unresolved film.
2538	5	a	Feel so haphazardly conceived and slapped together that one wonders for whom this compilation was made.
2539	1	a	If any film comedy prior to The Savages so fully earns the characterization 'painfully funny,' I'd like to know about it.
2540	2	a	Black adds a few twists to the mix of his own, including a familial aspect to the plot, which is unexpected given his often machismo style in the action film genre.
2541	3	a	One of the stronget Depression era's social protest films, this expose shattered audiences in its harrowing depiction of guards' brutalities and other inhuman conditions of prison chain gangs.
2542	4	a	For all its chilled intelligence and topical ambition this is a bloodless adaptation, but worth seeing for Hoffman's deft and ghostly presence.
2543	4	a	Because no good joke in Hollywood goes untold again ... and again, the mixed-couple setup receives another extended workout in this modestly amusing sequel.
2544	5	a	Duval and Caine make the film watchable, but there's too much gunplay for the movie to truly be the child-friendly entertainment that it pretends.
2545	5	a	This feature, spun off from the PBS series, will provide preschoolers with comfort and amusement, though not rapture or enchantment.
2546	4	a	There are too many characters, but some are a lot of fun. The tone shifts, from graphic murder to wig-flipping farce, are too extreme, but much of it works.
2547	4	a	The downer plot with a predictable ending never rises above television tearjerker movie of the week, but the songs are enough to recommend to fans of this genre.
2548	7	a	You could nap for an hour and not miss a thing.
2549	1	a	I'm hard-pressed to think of a recent movie that's as uncomfortable and disturbing as It Comes at Night.
2550	6	a	Friendly, formulaic, completely harmless.
2551	2	a	Disney's attempt to out-subvert the subversives comes with this often delightful rom-com fairytale.
2552	3	a	If the film fails on some levels, I would rather watch a film that shoots for the moon and falls short than a film that is happy being average.
2553	3	a	It sure is fun to watch Cranston at his best again, masterfully walking the tightrope between good and bad.
2554	4	a	Cohen continues to milk his cash cow series with some success.
2555	6	a	Though beautiful to look at and graced with moments of ticklish camp, The Skin I Live In is also sluggish, arbitrarily conceived and, especially in its sagging middle, unaccountably dull.
2556	5	a	Terrible movie. And a definite must-see. Plus the DVD is surprisingly rich and moist.
2557	0	a	A movie of startling power and intimacy.
2558	5	a	Reno does what he can in a thankless situation, the film ricochets from humor to violence and back again, and Ryoko Hirosue makes us wonder if she is always like that.
2559	3	a	"In its exuberantly smutty way, ""The To Do List"" is revolutionary: A teen sex comedy where the girls get to play nasty and the boys stand around looking terrified."
2560	6	a	Paul Weitz's satirical farce gets the details right while missing the big picture.
2561	2	a	It's a fine action film. I just wish I could say it was more fun.
2562	2	a	The sequel now repeats the same winning formula of its predecessor. [Full review in Spanish]
2563	1	a	Considering the sordid themes running throughout Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri, McDonagh's tone is astonishingly warm. He knows how to poke fun at characters' quirks without demeaning them.
2564	3	a	the kind of all-out, over the top action movie they just don't make anymore, which is probably a good thing because the human brain can only take a movie that provides the equivalent to getting three consecutive adrenaline shots so many times.
2565	6	a	At the very least, petrol-headed punters won't be left fuming by what whizzes past in a blur here.
2566	9	a	"Unfunny ""comedy"" is crude, profane, drug-filled."
2567	1	a	[Charlize Theron] so completely buries herself in this woman's impetuousness, rage and vulnerability that she simply ceases to exist.
2568	3	a	Seemingly improvised and entirely natural but still structured and splendidly directed by writer Richard Linklater.
2569	0	a	The material is right up Schrader's alley, and while his vision of the first 'Exorcist' chapter isn't a masterpiece, it's far superior to the Renny Harlin prequel to The Exorcist.
2570	3	a	It may be the same old partners but it's a better dance -- here, at least, history leads and Hollywood follows.
2571	1	a	There are creepy old houses, and then there is Crimson Peak.
2572	10	a	Rotten disaster movie from that rotten time when disaster movies had a comeback.
2573	3	a	Once you excuse the silliness of the concept, the movie is actually entertaining enough to win over this old pirate.
2574	3	a	It may look like an art film, but it's anything but. It's a good, old-fashioned, formulaic, Hollywood romantic comedy rise-and-fall story told with a modern sensibility and easily accessible by mainstream audiences.
2575	4	a	Although it's not quite as consistently engaging or funny as it could be, this doggy adventure has moments that grab the imagination
2576	5	a	The Texas Chainsaw Massacre: The Beginning misses everything that made the first one eat into your spine like meningitis.
2577	7	a	Almost nothing about this MTV production, a heist movie about standardized testing, works.
2578	7	a	Director Peter Webber clearly wants Hannibal Rising to be a class production. Unfortunately, he makes the whole affair too artsy and staid for its own good, which results in a plodding pace that induces more eyelid drooping than tension.
2579	4	a	Fortunately, when the movie does remember to be funny, it's very, very funny.
2580	4	a	Mother and Child keeps the traffic moving smoothly, much more so than a movie like Crash, because Garcia writes characters rather than positions, and he knows that the silences between people usually speak louder than their words.
2581	4	a	There are amusing moments sprinkled throughout the film, a few genuine laughs, and some nicely played dramatic scenes.
2582	1	a	The seductive thing about Aronofsky's film is that it is halfway plausible in terms of modern physics and math.
2583	4	a	Not great, but worth seeing.
2584	4	a	Put this one in the category of decent material, good cast, and misguided execution.
2585	6	a	A mix of hilarious stunts and idiotic pranks that still doesn't compare to what some of the cast members have done in other videos.
2586	0	a	NO MAN'S LAND is the best war movie since SAVING PRIVATE RYAN.
2587	4	a	Technically well made, but there are a plethora of more entertaining Hitchcock films available.
2588	5	a	Perhaps what makes The Cloverfield Paradox so frustrating is that it squanders the gifts it has been given.
2589	1	a	A powerful tale of crime, guilt, and punishment.
2590	6	a	One of those heartfelt but dubious films about the importance of family.
2591	3	a	The Fincher version doesn't actively negate the presence of the earlier one - it doesn't have to - but its confidence and bravado are like a strong blast of sunlight with the ability to fade the memory of whatever came before.
2592	4	a	The second half gets so worked up over itself that Hancock becomes nearly unrecognizable as the movie we were all enjoying twenty minutes earlier.
2593	5	a	while it isn't a necessary addition to the trilogy, it still entertains and delivers the goods in the gore department, and that's what we go to a Zombie movie for, isn't it?
2594	3	a	Warm, funny and delightfully nostalgic, this is a must-watch this Christmas for the whole family.
2595	6	a	When all is said and done, it builds to a climax so tedious the only mystery is how big a yawn will be generated by the endgame theatrics.
2596	1	a	It makes you feel good the way that Forrest Gump made you feel good, as if the filmmakers were seriously trying to make a fun, wholesome, entertaining movie without taking on the industry with a moral agenda.
2597	0	a	There may be plenty of films that are more fun to rent than Fiddler on the Roof, but how many of them get to the heart of the human experience?
2598	3	a	Good, old fashioned, escapist entertainment.
2599	6	a	A very familiar story, but well crafted
2600	3	a	Delivers the goods as a zippy piece of sci-fi pulp.
2601	4	a	Director Ray Lawrence captures in Jindabyne both the intimacy of the lives of married people and the broader fabric of a community -- and the soap-bubble fragility of our perceptions of our lovers, friends and neighbors.
2602	3	a	The heart of the film's charm is Sandra Bullock.
2603	1	a	It's an exemplary film, and far less depressing than it sounds.
2604	4	a	Six hilariously-scripted parts, but they run out of laugh material long before the movie ends, and Galaxy Quest must then limp to the closing credits supported by its actual plot, which is stupider than anything Star Trek ever devised.
2605	5	a	Depp's is a murky performance in a murky movie.
2606	5	a	This is special-effects wizard Ray Harryhausen's baby.
2607	3	a	Tanovic makes Land accessible and compelling enough for audiences everywhere to appreciate.
2608	4	a	Still a fun movie even if it doesn't match the high standards of the rest of the series thanks to Woo bringing his trademark over the top action sequences.
2609	6	a	It's dispiriting to see James Marsh deploy a rhetorical strategy of simply assuming human/chimp equivalence in order to stoke outrage at Nim's post-experiment treatment.
2610	6	a	The real stars of the sequel are the dinosaurs...But look out for the flying Pteranodons, which we see flying off into the sunset as a precursor to yet another unnecessary sequel.
2611	1	a	Transmits eerie imagery, nail-biting tension and excellent chills.
2612	6	a	Sooner or later, viewers have to ask themselves: If they were to do this film with live actors, would it be worth seeing?
2613	3	a	The pleasures of Kore-eda's film comes in meeting these characters-and they are considerable.
2614	8	a	Devoid of any appeal that isn't concentrated around star Aaron Eckhart's impeccably-sculpted muscles, this effects-laden lump of cinematic coal is as nonsensical and ill-conceived as it is boring.
2615	3	a	Landmark Bergman
2616	4	a	An almost constant laugh riot of extreme gross-out humor and surprisingly limber lampoonery.
2617	4	a	Juvenile? Sure. Funny? Certainly -- though not nearly as often as one might reasonably expect from these guys.
2618	3	a	The problems and characters it reveals are universal and involving, and the film itself -- as well its delightful cast -- is so breezy, pretty and gifted, it really won my heart.
2619	3	a	Both a return to form and a heartening attempt to move beyond Jarmusch's increasingly restrictive formal style.
2620	4	a	A nice, heavy movie, if a bit depressing.
2621	5	a	Jason before hockey mask, but with a nifty flour sack on his head
2622	3	a	Despite his strangely receding hairline, bug-eyed demeanor and hunchback stance, Cage somehow avoids making this police lieutenant a caricature.
2623	0	a	A sad, superior human comedy played out on the back roads of life.
2624	3	a	For all its references to the show's history, the film never panders. It's an evolution of the core concept as opposed to a nostalgia-tinged reproduction, and is all the better for it.
2625	1	a	This is three-hankie wonderful.
2626	6	a	The action sequence on the train is truly remarkable, and Eastwood shoots with a documentary-style immediacy, but the surrounding film - especially the script and performances - doesn't serve this thrilling true-life story, or the audience. 
2627	4	a	It's a journey of self-belief and discovery signposted just a little too heavily that is saved by more than a smattering of the type of writing that fits Fey like a glove and gives Freeman his best role since Watson.
2628	6	a	If this represents the true vision of director Jimmy Hayward, then I have only one question: What was he thinking?
2629	3	a	By balancing comedy and drama and focusing on real solutions to real problems, Lee creates a film that pulses with the feeling of real life.
2630	6	a	The Bourne films have fundamentally altered the rules... Every action thriller from here on out must adapt or risk coming across like some middling, antiquated dinosaur.
2631	6	a	A sociopolitical satire with a lot of bark, but not enough bite.
2632	4	a	When you make a movie set in Philly, you'd better get it right. Knowledgeable Eagles' fans may find Russell's sense of history maddening.
2633	5	a	If Wilson's trademark grin is looking jaundiced by the finale, he has only himself to blame. With You, Me and Dupree, he has produced a movie as lazy and immature as its title character.
2634	6	a	Anyone who's followed Woo's career knows he's better than this material.
2635	4	a	A cheerful enough but imminently forgettable rip-off of [Besson's] earlier work.
2636	4	a	The movie is certainly amusing, but it's uneven.
2637	3	a	[A] little gem of a movie.
2638	0	a	Silver Linings Playbook is an infectiously rousing crowd-pleaser about psychological damage and emotional healing, which would seem oxymoronic if not for the authentic, insightful atmosphere and marvelous performances.
2639	4	a	Enjoyable escapism.
2640	9	a	The end result, sad to say, is just about as entertaining as watching someone else's home movies for two solid hours
2641	4	a	The skeptical and the secular also need stories of martyrdom and rousing acts of cinematic preaching.
2642	6	a	Film works very hard to have her make sense [but] the more comedic flares and backstory details. . .the less she jells. . .Her arc isn't completely convincing.
2643	6	a	I am wearying of Payne's world view. I am beginning to wonder if he is capable of embracing anybody or anything with the sort of depth of feeling that real art demands.
2644	6	a	Exemplary lives gathered in a movie that does not do them justice. [Full review in Spanish]
2645	2	a	Mr. Compston's untamed star power gives the movie a heart, a sweetness that makes the title heartfelt and not just cheaply ironic.
2646	4	a	Funny romcom has lots of sex, profanity, some drinking.
2647	3	a	While it may not be Guillermo del Toro's best film, Crimson Peak nonetheless offers enough phantasmagoric appeal to draw you in. 
2648	9	a	One trio you should avoid making a quartet by taking a seat in the audience.
2649	3	a	The film can be seen as another element that qualifies Todd Haynes as a director with something interesting to say. [Full review in Spanish]
2650	3	a	Grab a broomstick and sail along for the ride.
2651	5	a	If you feel in the need for a generic teen horror film, there is no reason to choose this one over any of the others.
2652	4	a	repetitious and just not that funny on the whole, especially since it's so derivative and out of character next to the original
2653	2	a	Immersive and occasionally incoherent, stoner mystery Inherent Vice is a bold step for filmmaker Paul Thomas Anderson that unfortunately doesn't match the brilliance of his earlier films.
2654	4	a	What could have been an interesting exploration of the gateway to eternity takes an uncomfortable eternity to get to the point. 
2655	2	a	Darnell Martin's chronicle of the lives of Leonard Chess, Muddy Waters and others is a familiar tale that survives thanks to the successful efforts of its talented cast and crew.
2656	3	a	This one offers pleasures you won't find anywhere else.
2657	0	a	The boulder has never looked bigger, the guns have never sounded louder and Indy's whip has never cracked sharper than they do here.
2658	4	a	It's perfectly pleasant big screen comfort food -- meatloaf, potatoes and apple cobbler served as bubbly Tom Petty and ELO tunes waft from the soundtrack.
2659	1	a	Maybe the best film about teenagers ever made.
2660	5	a	Auteur-slumming at The WB
2661	4	a	It's all a tad schematic, and the direction is workmanlike but cautious.
2662	3	a	What gives the film its special kick is the match of Stiller and De Niro.
2663	4	a	...manages the difficult task of balancing an intriguing story without being too sappy or preachy.
2664	4	a	naggingly juvenile
2665	2	a	Should more than satisfactorily scratch the itch of those who have waited many long years to see Middle Earth back on screen.
2666	9	a	The plot certainly has possibilities, but far too many of them are botched by writer-director David Koepp, who's a better writer than director.
2667	2	a	"It's accurate to say that ""Palo Alto"" is another movie by another Coppola about the lives of the rich, bored and disaffected, but that description sells the movie short."
2668	9	a	I just have a vague sense of hating it.
2669	4	a	If Mr. Cruise peeled off his face and turned out to have been Chow Yun Fat all along, the picture might be saved.
2670	2	a	While critics have taken this WWII-era film to task for its blatant historical inaccuracies and eyebrow-raising plot, I feel compelled to say, Relax. This isn't The King's Speech. It's Adventures in Babysitting meets Roman Holiday.
2671	6	a	Unfocused and absolutely scattered...
2672	1	a	"Cosmopolis"" is Cronenberg's best film since ""eXistenZ"" and further viewings may place it higher than that. "
2673	4	a	A shimmering pastiche of missed opportunities.
2674	1	a	The Bourne Supremacy is a sharp, intelligent thriller that expertly mixes international espionage with a revenge story.
2675	6	a	If you like watching Owen Wilson play the same character he's played for most of his Hollywood career, and like to be able to predict every comic bit in a movie, You, Me and Dupree is your cup of tea -- or, maybe, your six-pack.
2676	0	a	Jesse James is that rarest of birds -- an art film with mass appeal.
2677	2	a	Tupac: Resurrection does not shy away from the violence or controversy in the rapper's life, but this film is a love letter, no question. Shakur comes across as smart, energetic and deeply philosophical.
2678	6	a	Could have used three or four more passes through the funny machine.
2679	6	a	If the movie was really interested in Rae's struggle to be more than a self-loathing sex object, it would spend less time depicting her as one.
2680	5	a	Brit Joe Wright is the wrong director for this film, which is part factual tale of journalist Lopez, part chronicle of the homeless, part intimate friendship between sensitive reporter and schizoid genius, but not satisfying on any level
2681	4	a	Culture-clashing through the snow, in a one-joke open sleigh, Meet the Fockers goes, laughing all the way . . . to the bank.
2682	2	a	Groceries aren't an obvious fit for the bawdy comedy of Rogen and his Superbad, Pineapple Express screenwriting partner-in-crime Evan Goldberg. That's a large part of Sausage Party's appeal.
2683	5	a	The net effect is comparable to being trapped at a cocktail party with a pretentious drunk waxing philosophically ad nauseum.
2684	4	a	After his first two laughably bad films, director Bartkowiak finally gets close to delivering a decent action picture. Buried within it is a half-hour shorter movie that would sizzle.
2685	0	a	Many of the novel techniques Welles developed with cinematographer Gregg Toland were calculated to offer new angles on film space.
2686	3	a	Gruesome yet imaginative teen psychosexual drama.
2687	0	a	You'll read plenty of comparisons to Robert Altman's The Long Goodbye or The Big Lebowski by the Coens, but it's really not doing the same thing either of those films did. This is a singular thing, and it is gorgeous.
2688	5	a	"Get on Up"" turns Brown's life into an even bigger mess."
2689	1	a	[Frances] McDormand fleshes out Mildred's emotions superbly. You really feel her pain, her loss, her rage, her guilt, and her desperation for closure.
2690	4	a	Black or White comes at the issue [of race] from so many angles simultaneously that the overall impact is muted.
2691	5	a	Anyone old enough to have a license is probably much too old to be amused by License to Drive.
2692	3	a	To my pleasure, the delightful Enchanted stands out in a season full of violent and drug-ridden movies.
2693	3	a	Friedkin's pretty shrewd himself, in how he teases out the humor without indulging Letts' immature glibness, and how he sidesteps Bible Belt baptism to waterboard us in the sewer of selfish human nature.
2694	2	a	Stunningly atmospheric and featuring eye-catching production and costume design, the romance can be stilted at times, but it's hard not to appreciate the cinematic composition in its entirety.
2695	9	a	It really just makes you want to play Doom.
2696	6	a	The dialogue was standard and dull, the acting was there but not fascinating, and the mystery of the killer wasn't as cool as it could have been.
2697	5	a	Plenty of premise but little payoff.
2698	5	a	The music's as troubled as the subject matter
2699	3	a	Director Tate Taylor's electrifying, energised portrait of James Brown rapidly takes a left turn away from formula via the musician's colourful brush with rock bottom.
2700	5	a	They should-a stopped at IV.
2701	3	a	As with any collection of shorts, some work better than others. Here, though, none is a failure and a few are fabulous.
2702	2	a	A hopeful and positive film like this, while playing it safe on the surface, actually can do a whole world of good, and for that, its importance is self-evident. This is cinema that people will owe their lives to.
2703	6	a	The screenwriter seems obsessed with introducing dramatic conflict, which feels both strained and convenient.
2704	6	a	The plot is enough to induce narcolepsy.
2705	5	a	An airless, sometimes distressingly mirthless comedy.
2706	4	a	We've seen this story before, but it's told surprisingly well here.
2707	5	a	Those hoping for more than just a long, outdoor version of Barney's TV show, they will likely be disappointed.
2708	4	a	It's enjoyable, with a cracking performance from Michael Constantine as Toula's father Gus.
2709	3	a	I enjoyed Lawrence Kasdan's Darling Companion on several levels, even as I realized that it's not - by any standard criteria - a terribly good movie.
2710	5	a	"As exciting as clothing bought off the rack at K-Mart and less informative than even the weakest episode of ""Project Runway."
2711	3	a	Dynamite performances from Annette Bening and Naomi Watts ignite this strong drama from writer-director Rodrigo Garcia.
2712	4	a	What we have here in From Dusk Till Dawn is Pulp Fiction with teeth.
2713	6	a	If human beings were made up entirely of eyeballs, this would be an instant classic.
2714	1	a	A sinister delight for the black at heart.
2715	3	a	Formulaic as it is, Roll Bounce is still a blast.
2716	3	a	Though not as overall impressive as his next picture Ran, Kagemusha, Akira Kurosawa's return to the epic Samurai film deservedly received Oscar nominations for its great pictorial beauty and other production values.
2717	3	a	This ranks as one of Hammer's greatest ever.
2718	0	a	The filmmaking here, though rushed and on the cheap, is a hot stew of influences... all of it coalesces into a cinematic essay about the violence and chaos, and also the vitality and urgency, of worldly life.
2719	9	a	The film never captures its audience.
2720	5	a	The independent sector of American cinema, you would think, would do better.
2721	2	a	The filmmakers' eye for detail and the high standards of performance convey a strong sense of the girls' environment.
2722	5	a	One shouldn't knock the plotting for being distinctly old-school, but criticism deserves to be levelled at the manner in which so much talent is squandered.
2723	4	a	Moore handles the role beautifully, emphasizing Alice's fastidiousness and dignity as they unravel against her will.
2724	5	a	Yet another Chris Lee Dracula picture
2725	3	a	The writing in this movie, by Duncan North, Greer Goodman and Jenniphr Goodman, among others, is as smart as anything I've seen in the past year.
2726	8	a	A by-the-book stalker picture marred by sloppy plotting. It's only scary if a malicious redneck holding a grudge terrifies you.
2727	5	a	What should have been an amiable if unremarkable comedy never rises much above the chuckle level as it attempts to pay homage to the eccentricity of small town life
2728	8	a	An understandably tired-looking Leslie Nielsen should seriously consider retirement from this tired genre.
2729	5	a	Good for a couple of well-earned laughs but ultimately overstays its welcome.
2730	4	a	Smith and Mendes, unfortunately, fizzle rather than spark, a near-fatal flaw in a romance that depends on its leads' chemistry to succeed.
2731	1	a	The dramatic, personal story of Colvin herself is absorbingly told here, largely because of Pike's dynamic performance.
2732	2	a	While it may not be the masterpiece that some claim, it does have the heft and texture of a major work.
2733	6	a	Attention please, this in-flight movie will be cancelled due to a predictable plot that leaves one about as satisfied a bag of airplane peanuts.
2734	1	a	The Incredibles, for all its kid-friendly sops, feels like one of the most mature movies currently gracing theaters. 
2735	0	a	Call Me by Your Name is one of the great movies of the year.
2736	3	a	For the first time in years, it feels like Disney has done its namesake proud.
2737	9	a	A predictable and failed attempt to create a new franchise for Vin Diesel. [Full review in Spanish]
2738	3	a	While others labor in the digital vineyard, Kaurismaki forges modern antiques out of unfashionable materials that, like a jukebox from a junkyard, are still in working order.
2739	6	a	Comparatively, a movie about a hotel for hogs, logs or frogs might have had a chance.
2740	6	a	Reign of Fire, like a lot of films these days, is a bunch of eye-popping effects in search of a plot.
2741	3	a	It Comes At Night is a well-crafted examination of the human condition.
2742	6	a	Just don't expect to be dazzled by the story, because if you're like me... you'll have trouble following the faces, and hence, the plot, from one scene to another.
2743	3	a	It's the simple charm and humour of the tale that lingers in the memory.
2744	7	a	The film's clumsiness detracts from the solemnity of the story and makes even decent actors such as Harvey Keitel and Steve Buscemi look bad.
2745	9	a	Has an off-putting racial subtext that makes it difficult to simply sit back and enjoy.
2746	1	a	A remarkably original and terrifying ghost tale.
2747	2	a	Virtually hitch-free, making it a true cinema valentine.
2748	3	a	Schrader and his cast commit to the project with sharpened and unblinking seriousness, even when the going gets mesmerically weird, with violence, visions, levitations and Neil Young protest songs chanted sombrely by toxic swamps.
2749	4	a	"While ""The World's End"" might be a rousing success in the canon of many other inferior filmmakers, for Edgar Wright it's a step down. "
2750	5	a	It's never as fully engaging as you might hope.
2751	5	a	"Initially suspenseful and has a sexy cast and beautiful scenery that provides lots of eye candy, but the suspense and intrigue fizzle out when its ""whodunit"" mystery ends during the hour mark..."
2752	5	a	Riiight. Who's up for some Parcheesi?
2753	1	a	Watching Soul Power is like flipping through Polaroids of that era. The color is a little washed out and everyone looks amazingly young.
2754	4	a	If all of this sounds a bit heavy, even dark and scary, indeed some of it is. But it's also very funny, action packed and pithy.
2755	4	a	A clumsy mishmash of a comedy.
2756	4	a	If you like a spectacle, whoo boy, you have found your perfect match.
2757	4	a	The cast is little more than the sum total of golden skin, firm flesh and blindingly white teeth, but in a film that demands them to be half-naked and soaking wet most of the time, looks trump technical acting skill every time.
2758	3	a	I can only say that whatever career notes MacFarlane has hit wrong recently, the Teds aren't among them.
2759	3	a	Full-blooded and fierce, Miami Vice is the antidote for other TV-to-film adaptations.
2760	5	a	"If this really is the last ""Pitch Perfect"" movie, I hate to contradict that ""Cups"" song, but we're not going to miss them when they're gone, when they're gone."
2761	2	a	It's a gorgeous, strange little piece, but I did find myself wishing it poked fewer aces out its sleeve after urging us to pay such close attention.
2762	4	a	"Focusing on fun, the direction of this film steers like a spaceship through a mine field, dodging in and out from strong to ""Dr. Who cheesy"" and back."
2763	6	a	It will seem awfully familiar territory.
2764	4	a	Decent King adaptations shrouded with a weak framing story.
2765	1	a	The best review I can give a drama or an actor: When the film ends you still believe the character lives on.
2766	0	a	Coppola somehow gets to the essence of human wanting with an amazing efficiency of style.
2767	9	a	...a total failure on almost every single level...
2768	2	a	It's an enjoyable and frequently hilarious lampoon of easy targets, but a stinging satire would be so much more satisfying.
2769	3	a	The movie isn't too concerned with age differences or hitting biographical highlights. Rather, it tries to get at the heart of how these two connected. 
2770	3	a	A bold and imaginative portrait of the life of Jesus of Nazareth and his struggles.
2771	1	a	Those who can stomach the dark subject matter and the daunting running time are rewarded with a work of sublime maturity.
2772	9	a	Not a laugh in it. 
2773	6	a	The actors all grit teeth, chew mouthfuls of mushy cornpone and attempt to make something of this, despite a cheese-ball script and pretty perfunctory direction, both by Shana Feste.
2774	4	a	It's ultimately a pastiche-by-numbers and doesn't live up to its full potential, but as a visual treat and one of Depp's better vehicles of recent years, it delivers the basic goods.
2775	2	a	A structurally solid B-movie, marked by smart casting and carefully modulated performances, that delivers high on the popcorn-munching entertainment scale.
2776	3	a	I've described the style of the film in some detail because it is so hypnotic and eventually so comic.
2777	7	a	Without any suspense the film just looks like it's an extended commercial for dudes who think they look cool in throwaway sunglasses.
2778	0	a	Stunning and heartfelt; Scorsese at the height of his power and artistry
2779	7	a	It is impressively made, but leaves a nasty taste in the mouth.
2780	8	a	The film makes Bond feel relevant and new without forgetting what made those old Bond films work.
2781	5	a	Mildly amusing but ultimately a sloppy, forgettable enterprise.
2782	3	a	Boasts the best and funniest vomit scene since Monty Python and the Meaning of Life.
2783	3	a	For a good time, come see this adorable, sexy, deviously antic piece of cockeyed comedy. You want nominations?
2784	0	a	The Artist is a freakishly good one-off - I'd hate to call it a fluke, but it's unlikely someone could replicate this approach to such great effect in the near future.
2785	3	a	Based on a true story, Valkyrie aims to be a thriller, not an issues movie, and it succeeds.
2786	2	a	An imaginative family film featuring a tremendously mischievous and likable lead character.
2787	5	a	The film doesn't trust the audience to get to the point of caring without a roadmap of platitude-laden speeches and shots of eyes brimming with tears.
2788	4	a	The film is crammed with hurried details -- but at the expense of exploring serious ideas or better defining the characters.
2789	6	a	Limit all too often ends up showing the same thing: a disposable, second-string actor clinging to a Styrofoam ledge, looking down at an impossibly deep chasm.
2790	4	a	An odd composition of stolid chamber drama and manic acting by its magnetic star, the movie makes for an occasionally invigorating experience that is too predictable and mannered for its own good.
2791	5	a	The tag line for the advertising campaign is bold: 'A film that dares to tell the truth about women.' I, unfortunately, missed whatever truth that was.
2792	3	a	Just as director Joe Wright conveyed the multiplicity of emotion at the Dunkirk beachhead in Atonement, he conducts his version of downtown L.A. with a maestro's baton.
2793	0	a	Una historia excepcionalmente narrada.
2794	4	a	Must-see viewing for anyone involved in the high-tech industry. Others may find it migraine-inducing, despite Moore's attempts at whimsy and spoon feeding.
2795	2	a	Action fans will get a kick out of it. Mark this one as strictly for the testosterone set.
2796	0	a	Moore plays the descent into dementia with notable subtlety. There's no grandstanding.
2797	6	a	The performances prevent the film from becoming totally generic.
2798	6	a	The main problem remains the impossibility of subjecting a film that is fundamentally about landscape and history to the demands of such a coarse dramatic form.
2799	5	a	Despite using the same premise and numerous identical plot points, this remake replaces suspense with boredom and witty dialogue with lame lines any self-respecting actor should be embarrassed to utter.
2800	3	a	Sweet, funny and touching.
2801	6	a	At a certain point its sheer can-you-top-this excess takes over, credibility flies out the window and there's no reason to continue paying attention.
2802	6	a	Almost everything that made The Bourne Identity refreshing -- the wit, the irony, the suspense, the novelty of its premise -- is gone.
2803	3	a	The result is a magnificent look at what it means to be human.
2804	5	a	A resounding misfire.
2805	6	a	This film has plenty of bad attitude for sale, but the black humor only delivers sporadically on the laughs.
2806	3	a	No one will mistake Man of the Year for movie of the year, but it says some things worth being said without the usual straight face.
2807	3	a	We really come to care about the characters.
2808	4	a	it's original, sharply funny, and rather moving
2809	2	a	Not great, but it reminds us why we liked her so much in the first place.
2810	1	a	A heartbreakingly sad yet remarkable film from director Sam Mendes.
2811	4	a	a picture with a situation instead of a plot
2812	2	a	For all of Kelly's storytelling troubles, he has no problem with creating the film's gorgeously ominous atmosphere.
2813	3	a	[E]xcruciatingly punishes impressive international ensemble. [U]npredictable who will make it through each challenge [that] brings human perspective to a large continent.
2814	4	a	Maintaining tension in the face of a foregone conclusion is no mean trick, but Mr. Singer and company do as well as anyone could hope.
2815	7	a	August is a brooding, boring indie drama about the death of the culture-wide hallucination that was the dot-com bubble, and the moment when countless dot-com millionaires on paper became real-life paupers.
2816	6	a	While Ryan's performance has the proper blend of confidence and cleavage, the movie succeeds only in producing more fight flick cliches than a Rocky movie marathon.
2817	3	a	It is a movie that opens with a bang and goes out with a somber, and for me quite poignant, whimper, the human story at its core one I couldn't tear my eyes away from.
2818	6	a	Stiller's forceful performance does his character a solid.
2819	0	a	Astounding for its number of effective gags, and it is a comedy that loses nothing on repeat viewings.
2820	3	a	A first-class animated feature.
2821	5	a	Chan brings martial artistry to the fight, Cusack his siege skills, and the the film overall is a mishmash of languages, styles and tones.
2822	4	a	Solid, rarely showy performances, meticulously recreated detective work and moments of pure unadulterated grief accent this whodunit, a movie that will have those who haven't read the book fooled for much of its length.
2823	1	a	A mesmerizing thriller anchored by a brilliant, revelatory performance by Rooney Mara.
2824	3	a	A fascinating movie, flawed but occasionally brilliant, and it's also not at all the film we were expecting.
2825	5	a	Cameron Crowe won't suffer another total commercial and critical flameout, but this is no return to form.
2826	3	a	There is raunch aplenty, but none that doesn't serve a story that is sharp, smart and wry
2827	9	a	Visually unappealing and inane at every turn, this one's the absolute pits.
2828	3	a	It's the sort of funny that encompasses both definitions of the word and that is watched, as often as not, with clenched teeth and the temptation to cover ones eyes fighting with the much stronger temptation to see what happens next. 
2829	4	a	The picture revels in its own unconventionality, The Extra Man a consistently engaging curiosity even when some of its more important pieces don't quite live up to the glorious oddities surrounding them.
2830	3	a	Modest in almost every respect, yet deeply satisfying.
2831	0	a	[Fincher] has made The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo into an electrifying movie by turning the audience into addicts of the forbidden, looking for the sick and twisted things we can't see.
2832	4	a	Dolly Parton's immense likablity makes this very slight film an amiable watch.
2833	4	a	Dreary and depressing tale that would not have survived without the powerful and emotional performances by Kate Winslet and Leonardo DiCaprio.
2834	3	a	What could and should have been a great film turns out instead to be merely an adequate one. Only the film's look and Crowe's usually wonderful performance causes it to rise above the ordinary.
2835	3	a	You will recognize Ben Stone, in all his potheaded, work-fearing glory, and the laugh of recognition is surely the purest of all laughs.
2836	5	a	The abundance of stereotypes is annoying; each character sticks to type and recites dialogue you would expect that type to say.
2837	3	a	The look and feel of the movie are as authentic as any Western since Robert Altman's McCabe and Mrs. Miller...
2838	2	a	A great escape leads to a harrowing test of endurance. 
2839	6	a	...just as mediocre and gratingly unfunny as its predecessor...
2840	3	a	Portrays high school basketball as a means to an end, not an end in itself.
2841	3	a	Nothing much happens, but we go on a journey just the same...
2842	4	a	Far too lively and good-natured to deserve harsh criticism; in a season full of prestige-hungry Oscar wannabes, it's nice to see a film interested primarily in putting a smile on your face.
2843	4	a	As the Taylor Swift song kicks in at the climax and Seyfried has her big romantic moment, you can't help but crane your neck to see what Redgrave is up to in the background.
2844	0	a	For some of the way, it seems like a kind of skateboard whodunit. Soon enough, we understand it's much more than that. And by then, we know we're in for a ride to remember.
2845	1	a	It's a movie about disconnection: from your family, from the world around you, even from yourself. It's a movie about being trapped in that high chair and wanting so badly to be able to reach that floor.
2846	3	a	The creepy exploration of the unknown and unexplainable is far more frightening than the violent killings that typify most horror films.
2847	3	a	This is not the film to see if you're looking for light, frivolous entertainment, but it reflects humanity in a way that can be cathartic.
2848	3	a	Not a lot of attention is paid to the troubling implications of living your life in a make-believe space, but the adventure moves fast enough to prevent the viewer from worrying too much about it.
2849	6	a	Viewers who seek out this film will get just what they deserve and exactly what they want. Crass as it is, Little Man will have a special place in the right sort of heart.
2850	4	a	It's not worth seeing, but if all the hype has you expecting a classic, you should lower your expectations.
2851	4	a	The movie isn't perfect, but it's good enough, and better than most. It should keep us occupied until the big screen version of The Apprentice comes along.
2852	3	a	The brutality has such a mythical grandeur that it occasionally resembles beauty. 
2853	4	a	Doesn't do too much wrong, yet struggles with the weight of expectation.
2854	4	a	Mediocre disaster flick.
2855	6	a	This is what happens when someone takes what might have been a moderately- entertaining television Christmas special and tries to adapt it for the big screen.
2856	5	a	Common sense and good taste go out the window as Gooding hams it up through one nauseating scene of uplift after another.
2857	3	a	Neil Jordan uses very broad and movie-ish strokes to paint his portrait of the busy, eponymous hero.
2858	3	a	Battle Royale is The Hunger Games not diluted for young audiences.
2859	10	a	So horrible I didn't even like it when I was a member of its target audience.
2860	4	a	Lengthy and often off-hot topic, this is still a gripping saga with stand-out turns from Timberlake, Hirsch and kid-in-the-spotlight Yelchin.
2861	4	a	The director benefits from a powerhouse duo in Nicholson and Caine. It's like watching two cats fight for the same mouse, because both characters are corrupted to the bone.
2862	4	a	Friends with Kids takes an unusual romantic premise and explores it in satisfying and perceptive depth.
2863	3	a	As a concept, it's flawed. As a remake, it's good. As modern horror, it's a firecracker.
2864	4	a	Certainly worth the price of admission for the laughs, but we could've used more in the last third of the film.
2865	6	a	another singular case exploited and expanded to look ordinary
2866	4	a	Van Sant manages to make a small elegy about adolescence out of a film which in other hands might have become a slightly grisly thriller.
2867	5	a	The special effects are poorly designed and the laughs are readily found, though probably not intentionally
2868	9	a	In mechanical terms, Figgis can't seem to generate anything resembling a genuine startle or moment of suspense, and his sense of internal dramatic logic seems as cracked and flimsy as the tiling on the estate pool.
2869	6	a	The filmmakers coast on the fish-out-of-water premise, offering a decent number of clever lines and approaching genuine warmth but relying too heavily upon on-the-nose cameos and easy gags.
2870	1	a	[VIDEO ESSAY] William Friedkin has made the most triumphantly dark, funny, and sexy black comedy you could ever imagine. 
2871	3	a	It's refreshing for a change to see an apocalyptic vision that doesn't include shots of prominent world monuments being obliterated.
2872	0	a	A lengthy, leisurely paced film.
2873	7	a	The new camp counselors are interchangeable with the old ones. Different faces, same basic people.
2874	9	a	You wouldn't think a movie with this much plot could be this dull, but you'd be wrong.
2875	5	a	Feeble as comedy, the movie is needlessly violent, too, as if half the crew misguidedly thought they were making a foul-mouthed action thriller.
2876	7	a	In the end, and despite Ermey's best efforts, it's just another splatter flick.
2877	0	a	"Luminous, breathtaking, and so extraordinarily intimate one can scarcely believe something so miraculous has been captured in front of a camera by actors, the picture is close to a miracle. ""Call Me by Your Name"" is a motion picture to cherish."
2878	6	a	Mark Wahlberg, who has proved himself a very capable actor, seems to have nominated himself for the Russell Crowe Lack of Charisma Award, and is running a pretty convincing campaign.
2879	3	a	This latest of Mr. Hitchcock's efforts is a curiously whimsical thing.
2880	2	a	A movie that's clearly not for everyone, but those at whom it's targeted-whether allowed to enter according to the R rating or not-will find it a hoot.
2881	3	a	It may come as a bit of a shock to some that the most interesting turns in the woman-on-a-quest sojourn don't belong to Roberts, luminous though she is. Those are owned by a number of misty-eyed if masculine menfolk.
2882	6	a	Funny that Owen Wilson should star in a film about a guy who wears out his welcome....
2883	7	a	Hannibal Rising has put Hannibal Lecter in a basic revenge plot that doesn't need a Hannibal Lecter. In the process, it explains away one of cinema's legendary enigmas.
2884	6	a	"Maybe it's time for the ""Jurassic Park"" park franchise to join hands with Toho [Pictures] and Godzilla."
2885	4	a	It's a film of few words, not a wacky SNL Bill Murray. An abstract meditation on life, self, marriage w/ a few accents of humor shot entirely in Japan. 
2886	6	a	A tedious, choppily edited, uninvolving mess that can't be saved by its provocative premise and Rachel Weisz's radiant performance. 
2887	0	a	Gloom was never photographed so smartly.
2888	1	a	The old-school Cold War spy thriller is Bourne again.
2889	3	a	Killer Joe is emphatically not to everyone's taste, but it is among the purest cinematic experiences you'll have this year. It will also ensure that you never, ever look at fried chicken in quite the same way again.
2890	0	a	Another dazzling display of stunt driving and death-defying car chases involving souped-up, stolen automobiles. 
2891	4	a	Invictus shouldn't feel like just another sports movie; it should feel like a life movie. What a missed opportunity.
2892	6	a	Since director Iain Softley seems more interested in establishing tone and atmosphere than in creating vital personalities, he is unable to harness the full power of his story.
2893	4	a	It's definitely a Cornetto, but certainly not the best flavour. 
2894	3	a	Gary Busey received a well-deserved Oscar nomination for playing the rock 'n roll legend in this entertaining biopic.
2895	10	a	Each scene wreaks of routine; the film never manages to generate a single threat of suspense.
2896	6	a	"Fast Five"" represents Yankee ingenuity of the brutally stupid kind."
2897	3	a	Rife with uncertainty and realism, Weir's film is a stunning testament to human fortitude and to the power of Mother Nature.
2898	6	a	Introducing children to fun questions about evolution and gender politics, Mars Needs Moms is an odd, little hybrid of adventure and simplistic allegory.
2899	2	a	By making the choices the filmmakers did here, we get a movie that may not be profound, but it's both highly entertaining for its sports and fascinating for its social issues.
2900	5	a	A depressingly unemotional affair, with writing and some of the acting so flat that even its emotionally loaded situations can't inspire waterworks.
2901	5	a	As predictable and soulless as an over-produced country power ballad.
2902	4	a	Better-than-average SNL spin-off, and unfortunately the best thing Aykroyd's done sice Ghostbusters.
2903	3	a	Hitchcock gem.
2904	5	a	Platoon lite with a bitter ending that doesn't work in its favor...
2905	6	a	Formula is forgivable; roteness less so.
2906	4	a	For a movie built around a piece of film containing unsettling images, The Ring is itself a rather tame undertaking.
2907	3	a	This version does justice both to Stevenson and to the sci-fi genre.
2908	7	a	This movie takes itself way too seriously, though, unfortunately, not quite so seriously that I was able to suppress those spontaneous guffaws that kept arising.
2909	4	a	Marshall weaves together an exotically sumptuous production frayed by a disappointing ending that tries to draw a powdered happy face on tragedy.
2910	3	a	A homage to past masters like Hitchcock and Sirk, done up in irresistible Almodovar style...as a directorial love-letter to films and filmmaking, it's an absolute winner.
2911	4	a	Vardalos is not a great actress, but she is a likeable one ... John Corbett will never steer you wrong ... a cute premise, but it has all been done before
2912	3	a	"Black Nativity"" is such a likable and positive experience that you readily forgive its bumpy moments."
2913	3	a	The achievement of Jane Campion's learned and ravishing new film is to trace the comminglings and collisions of poetic creation and amatory passion.
2914	3	a	[A] devastating if flawed adaptation of the Richard Yates novel.
2915	1	a	Because Fincher loves things to look amazing, he's got the latest version of whatever digital advance it is that allows you to graft the head of one actor onto the body of another.
2916	4	a	Ladies and gentlemen, let your hankies unfurl.
2917	6	a	...a vampire film where the vampire hardly shows his face or fangs.
2918	5	a	Here is a pleasant, undemanding animated family comedy - decent enough, but it feels like a reshuffling of dozens of films you've seen before.
2919	10	a	When the comedy revolution comes, Jason Friedberg and Aaron Seltzer will be the first ones shot.
2920	1	a	Film Stars Don't Die in Liverpool is not your typical romance, and we love it for that. 
2921	4	a	Once Dracula is up and about, the script can't find much for him to do, but there are spirited performances from Shelley, as an uptight bourgeois who becomes a sensual vampire hoyden, and Kier, as a gun-toting monk who fills in for Van Helsing.
2922	1	a	Todd Haynes' most rapturous, riveting film in two decades. An exquisite romance of both gossamer beauty and gargantuan emotions, propelled by two of the year's best female performances and a synesthetic symbiosis between its cinematography and score.
2923	6	a	It all culminates in a climactic showdown during the reality show's frivolous final that's so terribly staged and written I nearly slapped my forehead in disbelief.
2924	5	a	The film gives these people just about nothing funny to do, and it's full of both gross-out gags that don't connect and dialogue that isn't especially funny. 
2925	4	a	the action is traded for suspense in the movie, which is when things really click
2926	6	a	For a film touted as a lurid, blues-themed Southern Gothic melodrama evocative of William Faulkner at his most decadent, Craig Brewer's Black Snake Moan turns out to be a disappointingly tame and rather conventional morality play.
2927	3	a	Effective thriller, but inferior to the British original.
2928	3	a	"Here's a sentence I never thought I'd write again: Woody Allen has made a wonderful new picture, ""Midnight in Paris,"" and it's his best, most enjoyable work in years."
2929	4	a	By the end, you may be surprised at yourself shedding a tear or two but it won't inspire the kind of all-encompassing emotional heaving the best weepies induce.
2930	1	a	An engrossing film that delights despite harboring what could be seen as a big flaw.
2931	4	a	A movie that's just plain awful but still manages to entertain on a guilty-pleasure, so-bad-it's-funny level.
2932	4	a	I almost hate to say it, but [Timberlake] might be reason enough to watch this.
2933	4	a	Spielberg is such a filmmaking savant that it's hard to tell where the cinema ends and the protection of his sanity begins in Schindler's List
2934	5	a	With Couple's Retreat, we're hoping for a Wedding Crashers redux we can turn into a date night. But all we get is something else to bitch about.
2935	4	a	As are most satires, this is silly and humorous with good performances. I squirmed quite a bit during the first hour, but Grant's performance is probably worth the price of admission.
2936	1	a	Puts the comparable American Beauty to shame.
2937	0	a	Surges with such juddering, largely suppressed emotion that the whiff of the pop-cultural Senior Common Room will trouble only the most resistant observer. 
2938	1	a	Like a black-and-white Hitchcockian tour of hell.
2939	4	a	You, Me and Dupree offers moderate fun in a less-than-stellar summer season.
2940	3	a	It is a love story, a masochistic and violent one admittedly, but once which has us setting our fob watches for the final chapter in what looks to be an enchanting trilogy.
2941	3	a	Even if you do figure out what's ahead, the movie's stylish execution rewards you for your cunning.
2942	4	a	Pearce's performance is assembled out of rigorously limited physical gestures and a vocal characterization that never rises above a murmur. But it's mesmerizing -- you can't take your eyes off him, and you miss him every time he leaves the scene.
2943	4	a	A kind of scuzzball Double Indemnity.
2944	6	a	It strays too far from the original to please hard-core fans and it is so confused in tone and purpose that it is hard to tell where it's aimed.
2945	0	a	Adams is daffy and delicious in a star-making role, and the script, direction and music are spot-on.
2946	0	a	Eastwood and his perfectly cast ensemble have added layers that give this blue collar multi-generational tragedy Shakespearean scope. It is one of those rare films that surpasses the impact of the book.
2947	6	a	Despite the film's decided thinness, there's still a kernel of something here -- a sweetness and vitality that peeks through.
2948	5	a	"Flowers"" abounds with well-worn movie archetypes and slathers on schmaltz."
2949	4	a	Often too concerned with how smart he's being, Sean Penn gets the quiet moments right while some of the more dialogue-intensive come off poorly.
2950	6	a	The movie is merely a long, empty exercise in style.
2951	2	a	...a good enough thriller with fine production values, but it's not top notch Fincher. Where it should have shrieked and howled it only occasionally rattles the windows.
2952	0	a	It is artful, inspiring, perfectly cast and powerfully acted, beautifully shot, scored with sensitivity rather than sentimentality, efficiently edited, profoundly dignified.
2953	5	a	Gooding is so pleasant and likable, it's hard to get mad at him for wasting our time.
2954	3	a	The Edge of Seventeen, the feature debut from writer Kelly Fremon Craig, stands out above the countless other teenage movies from recent years by virtue of its honesty and realism.
2955	4	a	The revelation of poverty, squalor and mental illness in LA's underclass is horrific. But the film suffers from uncertainty of tone.
2956	3	a	Attempting to describe the level of tragedy contained in Moore's performance in the film's third act brings to mind the limits within Alice's chosen field of study. Because no words do it justice.
2957	3	a	maintains a delicate balancing act between the comical tale of a boy's desire to be a ballet dancer and the backdrop of hard-edged, violent realism against which it is set
2958	4	a	Is Jack, who is patterned on a real-life character, sociopathic or just plain clueless? Gallo doesn't seem to care. He cares about parading before us lowlifes living the high life.
2959	5	a	To employ terminology that might be used by Simon Cowell, the brutally honest American Idol judge, American Dreamz is bloody awful.
2960	4	a	"Given the theme, the unfocused, scattershot narrative of ""WTF"" is understandable. While this may frustrate some viewers, the film works largely through an endearing performance by Tina Fey."
2961	3	a	Safety Not Guaranteed is droll and hilarious, but there isn't a cheap laugh in it, and the ending is so perfect it sends you soaring.
2962	5	a	Not Easily Broken, battles credibility problems. Even so, Duke crafts some nice scenes between Henson and Lewis as the movie pushes their own relationship to a point of catharsis.
2963	3	a	Some inner logic may not hold up under the sober light of day, but this unusual action-comedy has the loosey-goosey feel of something that can't miss, like a soused round of bar pool.
2964	3	a	Director Peter Weir and his cast and crew journeyed to such locations as Bulgaria, Morocco and India to give the film a realism that borders on documentary.
2965	4	a	[Indulges] the senses with its gore, set design and costuming, and drawing on the skills of its cast...
2966	6	a	Will adults enjoy this film? Some might be amused by the crazy situations and verbal and visual outrageousness--though they probably won't admit it.
2967	3	a	Taking Woodstock has the appeal of an inside story told from an especially good angle. But beyond that, the movie is a celebration of the way this event has gone into memory and of the meaning it has acquired.
2968	5	a	McConaughey's facial hair is his best acting prop: It seems to exists only to trap spittle after eating roasted meat.
2969	5	a	I'm not sure I've ever seen a fantasy film that's at once so visually amazing and so emotionally dead.
2970	2	a	"The best thing about ""Mother and Child"" is Annette Bening's perceptive performance."
2971	5	a	Perhaps the hardest thing to figure out about Christopher Robin is who the hell it's supposed to be aimed at.
2972	7	a	Rod Serling would have wrapped this mysterioso story about a psychiatrist and a suicidal patient dislocated by time, space and a lot of crazily raked angles into a tight half-hour episode.
2973	8	a	Gibson turns the thing into a bloody shock spectacle; he implicates the viewers like the Jews who watched the crucifixion and beatings as entertainment.
2974	4	a	"The Angry Birds Movie"" is unnecessary but cute, like a bonnet on a cat - and there are certainly worse recommendations than that."
2975	6	a	Paper Heart is a cute movie, a little too cute and a little too aware of its own cuteness.
2976	7	a	A large, talented cast is mostly wasted in Welcome Home Roscoe Jenkins, one of those movies Hollywood cranks out to celebrate the down-home charms of small town life by exposing the vapidity of showbiz and celebrity.
2977	6	a	There is potential in this story to explore the way gender, sexual orientation and social class confined people in the Victorian era, but Close is so obviously female, it's distracting right from the start.
2978	7	a	Flatulence ensues.
2979	4	a	"Endless vistas of the lush Italian countryside, some playful banter, and a likable cast make ""Letters to Juliet"" worthwhile, even if you feel like you've seen it before. Several times before. "
2980	3	a	Beautifully-acted comedy-drama that doesn't overdose on its quirks.
2981	4	a	Connery and Zeta-Jones are such fun to watch together it almost doesn't matter how little sense the movie makes -- and their relationship is far more gleefully perverse, weirdly chivalrous and surprisingly interesting than the trailer makes it look.
2982	8	a	Not quite as funny as a perforated ulcer.
2983	3	a	Don't let this put you off Selma: it's a good, although not great movie, that steers a coherent path through a weighty historical moment.
2984	5	a	Feels less like high-concept filmmaking and more like wishful thinking.
2985	1	a	Capricious, meditative and absorbing.
2986	9	a	If watching people having their faces cut off, getting their legs amputated and having their throats tenderly slit is your idea of a horrific good time, you'll certainly get your money's worth here.
2987	6	a	Without that title and a year's worth of Internet-fueled buzz, this would be just another forgettable, mildly entertaining, mid-August throwaway movie.
2988	7	a	Foxx and friends are broken by this laughless comedy
2989	0	a	This sensational film is richly deserving of the lavish praise it has won from all corners.
2990	3	a	The drama is scaled to just the right size: kids get into trouble or inadvisable situations, but there are no major melodramatics. We see them in their natural habitat.
2991	3	a	If you only see one action movie this year, see The Expendables -- twice.
2992	1	a	An adrenaline pumping disaster movie told within the context of a small scale family drama ... is an entertaining thrill ride.
2993	4	a	The special effects here will have you reclining in your seat, admiring the spectacle. Unfortunately, the film's pedestrian pacing won't get you on the edge of it.
2994	4	a	May give the kids nightmares but it won't turn on your 'heartlight'.
2995	1	a	...This film will charm your socks off
2996	3	a	Sometimes movies tire us by trying too relentlessly to pound us with their brilliance and energy. Here is a movie pitched at about the energy level of a coffee break.
2997	5	a	Stale and stagy.
2998	3	a	Lancaster is wonderful; a tribute to the human spirit.
2999	3	a	Thrives on a thrilling soundtrack, a doozy of a yarn and Chadwick Boseman's dynamite-powered portrayal of Brown.
3000	3	a	Along with CLERKS, it makes a nice bookend to [Kevin] Smith's Jersey chronicles
3001	3	a	Easter Parade may not strike the perfect balance between song-dance interludes and story, but it's an appealing show just the same.
3002	1	a	[Palo Alto] is a lovely debut film, and a strong expression of just how it feels to be a teenager struggling to figure out your place in the world.
3003	6	a	Johnny Depp is such a talented chameleon that when he portrays someone who is supposed to be boring, he actually is boring.
3004	1	a	Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri will make you laugh -- and then make you wonder whether you should be laughing. And that's why it's so good. There are no easy answers.
3005	3	a	I cannot believe this movie didn't make a boatload of money.
3006	0	a	The dynamic between the sullen Smith and sincere Bateman may be the best thing in the Peter Berg's movie, but it's a tough call because the whole popcorn fest is flat-out fantastic.
3007	5	a	Woody the pretentious; has some moments, but overall it's too self-conscious.
3008	0	a	The lives are often desperate and the characters inarticulate, but the group portrait is as grandly, sometimes as hilariously, realized as anything the director has ever done.
3009	3	a	Hello, My Name Is Doris is aimed at an older audience, but Field's performance has so much youthful energy that it ends up being a broader story of the first buds of love that, like Doris, would be acceptable and entertaining with any crowd.
3010	4	a	Curious collection of shorts will bore most kids.
3011	6	a	The return of Shane Black to the world of The Predator is never defined as being the director's film or about the alien monster. [Full Review in Spanish]
3012	5	a	...a thoroughly mediocre Aliens ripoff.
3013	4	a	Because Mora doesn't go the usual route for The Beast Within, the film ends up being a bit of an oddball creature feature that often stumbles a bit tonally and suffers from some pacing issues around the midway point.
3014	6	a	Debra Messing and Dermot Mulroney star in a romantic comedy that struggles to capture the charm and ebullience of Four Weddings and a Funeral.
3015	1	a	It's best appreciated as an arcane work about a great tortured artist by a great tortured artist.
3016	2	a	a smart, visual dialectic on the ease of showing certain creative processes and the impossibility of documenting others.
3017	6	a	We get that the story may not be about answers, but the film could have used a lot more interesting, thought-provoking questions along the way.
3018	8	a	No drama, suspense or excitement in this dud.
3019	3	a	A definite feel-good movie.
3020	3	a	If you're squeamish, stay away. But risk missing a great film.
3021	4	a	There's something to the tribal primitivism of the picture, the idea that man at his essence is composed of balanced portions of nobility and violence.
3022	3	a	If Apatow was seeking to make a film that's smutty and funny, but also romantic and realistic about relationships, he's succeeded admirably.
3023	5	a	One of those pictures whose promising, if rather precious, premise is undercut by amateurish execution.
3024	2	a	"The real draw for ""Final Fantasy: The Spirits Within"" is to the many fans of the video game series and those who are curious...."
3025	4	a	Down-to-earth, funnier than you'd expect, and sympathetic toward its volatile, damaged characters. 
3026	6	a	"If it weren't for Matthew McConaughey's tightly coiled performance, the nasty white-trash drama ""Killer Joe"" wouldn't be worth the powder it would take to blow it to hell."
3027	0	a	Sean Penn's achingly poetic Into the Wild seduces gently, creeping up in incremental steps. Yet in the end it leaves us drained and devastated.
3028	0	a	From start to finish this is a wonderful and immensely creative animated film about a loser who arises to the challenges faced in a town without water. 
3029	3	a	Smartly directed and sharply written, this is an entertaining, emotionally engaging drama with a pair of tremendous performances from Anthony Hopkins and Helen Mirren.
3030	6	a	Jack Black and Cate Blanchett are a delightful duo, but a sense of wonder never takes hold here. It's a movie about magic that's disappointingly dull.
3031	9	a	Prince follows his disastrous Under the Cherry Moon with another lame film.
3032	3	a	Woody Allen's beleaguered heroes have never been reluctant to indulge in a little fantasy to get what they want.
3033	5	a	Unrelievedly somber and slow, giving a gloomily portentous feel to ideas that aren't nearly as profound as the makers seem to think.
3034	5	a	There's the makings of a nasty satire of modern American materialism [here] but in the end...the movie goes soft, squishy and even--heaven help us--preachy.
3035	4	a	The dependable Diesel and a fine cast keep this hokey action flick mostly entertaining.
3036	4	a	Fans of straight action/adventure may enjoy this film; fans of TV's Mission: Impossible may not recognize it.
3037	9	a	The usually dependable Rob Cohen directs from a ludicrous script.
3038	4	a	"Though hilarious in parts, and heartwarming in others, The World's End has the great misfortune of simply being branded as a ""fun"" comedy, and one that is sadly unlikely to amount to being too much more than that."
3039	2	a	never less than entertaining
3040	6	a	Middling mystery less mind-tickling than Non-Stop. That movie goes from kind of fun to really bad. Veronica Mars is so average it may as well never have existed at all.
3041	1	a	So often, I have seen films like this that try to walk the fine line between creativity and confusion. Director Marc Forster manages to walk that line with precision.
3042	3	a	The picture is gut-wrenching in its study of stress, illness, and love
3043	1	a	"Cruise, who already delivered a great performance this summer in ""Tropic Thunder,"" is at the top of his game here"
3044	4	a	a pleasant enough meringue of a romantic comedy. Light, sweet, and essentially insubstantial
3045	4	a	You see all the major landmarks, but how enlightening can a road trip be if you never even get off the highway?
3046	4	a	The movie loses focus when it most needs it.
3047	0	a	Henri Decae's black and white photography helped Truffaut enormously but what the director himself provides is a sense that though there is no easy answer to the problems of growing up, there is a hope that will never be wholly denied.
3048	1	a	A delicious blend of hilarity and heartbreak.
3049	1	a	Though hardly a crowd-pleaser. it's the sort of challenging, thought-provoking, stylistically striking piece of auteurism one rarely encounters nowadays.
3050	3	a	Seething with teen-angst irritability and an obstinate blind ignorance to just how much of an outcast he is, Napoleon Dynamite may be the biggest dork in the history of high school movies.
3051	3	a	If movies are among our greatest, most enduring vehicles for illusion, then a movie about dueling illusionists should, in theory, offer that same sleight of hand--only amplified. In this case, it does.
3052	4	a	Fitfully amusing and poignant in its insights into ageing, this cross-generational fling saga lacks the character and depth to say anything genuinely significant.
3053	1	a	You'll think. You'll laugh. You'll be marvelously entertained. And you'll be touched.
3054	5	a	What seems like a dream team on paper is more of a tedious nightmare on celluloid, where Bullock and Grant are trapped with their well-worn screen personas in a dumb, ultra-predictable movie.
3055	3	a	Loving tribute to silent films has a few tense moments.
3056	4	a	The action is reasonably well-staged, but the film is overlong and occasionally draggy.
3057	2	a	While it's too gentle to be a classic, it's still worth a look.
3058	2	a	If Killer of Sheep is Burnett's masterpiece, this film, an odd combination of drama, comedy, and irony, well-acted by Danny Glover, is his most accessible picture.
3059	6	a	Such great performances... Such a dreadful movie.
3060	5	a	'The Imitation Game' doesn't embarrass itself by trying to explain convoluted mathematical issues; there's nothing on the order of 'A Beautiful Mind''s forehead-slapping breakdown of game theory.
3061	10	a	At best it's perversely interesting as a major misstep for both stars.
3062	6	a	... the movie is strangely inert and depressingly literal-minded.
3063	5	a	The movie's leads are completely stranded by the humorless material and a glacial pacing that's about as exciting as an all-night filibuster orated by Orrin Hatch.
3064	5	a	"Unless your idea of wit is an unrelenting stream of groan-inducing insect puns, ""Bee Movie"" offers little more than buzzkill."
3065	0	a	A beautifully observed study of childhood that's unmissable, whatever your age. 
3066	2	a	A well-executed spy-thriller.
3067	3	a	"... the inventor of the summer blockbuster directing the biggest movie star on the planet... It's big, it's loud, and it's what you expect an ""event"" film to be."
3068	3	a	...an erratic yet consistently entertaining summer blockbuster...
3069	4	a	The four stars all give solid, nuanced performers, but it's Roberts whose the stand out - capturing the bewidlerment of adolescence perfectly.
3070	9	a	We know what sequel shouldn't have been made.
3071	4	a	Roscoe Jenkins works best when it aims lowest.
3072	3	a	...one of the most entertainingly trashy thrillers to hit multiplexes in quite some time...
3073	1	a	...something akin to a fatalistic primal scream: We suffer, therefore we are.
3074	9	a	The simple fact is that rape, no matter what the context, is not funny, and the fact this movie so blithely plays the moment off as another politically incorrect stepping stone isn't just wrong it's downright offensive.
3075	5	a	"Carnage Park"" is an extremely empty experience."
3076	0	a	Schrader's best screenplay since Taxi Driver.
3077	3	a	A worthy, thought-provoking follow-up to Another Earth, in which fact and faith square off with increasing complexity and consequences.
3078	0	a	"Nebraska"" strikes at a distinctly American mindset of jealousy, greed, and betrayal that undermines its citizens' equally persistent sense of optimism, integrity, and familial connection."
3079	9	a	[Williams] has played against type before, but his presence feels like epic miscasting in this underwritten dramedy ...
3080	7	a	The central flaw of Rules of Engagement is the script.
3081	9	a	Michael Chiklis won't have to put on that uncomfortable Thing outfit again.
3082	3	a	A pleasant and consistently engaging romance...
3083	9	a	The antics of cute or precocious children can't save this mess.
3084	2	a	The movie is clever, stylish, and full of fun, beautiful people that you wouldn't mind sharing a flat with, especially in an incredible city like Barcelona.
3085	6	a	There were extended sequences when my eyes literally could not track the action. Sense of space was demolished. Motion swamped the screen.
3086	9	a	If you loved the earlier films, these are moments you will hold on to, but they're very few, and they're not enough.
3087	0	a	An explosively suspenseful, deeply moving dark comedy and an astonishingly assured fiction debut from Tanovic.
3088	3	a	Gracefully directed, deliberately paced and intentionally free of the action you'd expect from a samurai film, all of which makes its climactic confrontation that much more effective.
3089	1	a	The best of Rango is a lot like the best of the first Pirates movie -- crazily funny and rambunctious.
3090	4	a	The rubber Seymour Cassell head makes it almost worthwhile.
3091	7	a	Perhaps the neurotic, self-entitled cluelessness on display, especially from Keaton's character, was meant to be amusing or gently satirical, but it's really just grating.
3092	3	a	Underappreciated gem with magnificent performances.
3093	9	a	A lazy assemblage of sketch- comedy raunch, mock-schlock TV ads, and ideas that even the writers of Mall Cop and Observe and Report would have tossed.
3094	4	a	"Although one of Sidney Lumet's minor efforts, ""The Anderson Tapes"" functions as a cool retro caper movie full of nostalgic details. The film's car chase climax is no joke."
3095	4	a	Colvin continually stresses finding the personal within her stories, and the movie itself fails to do just that.
3096	3	a	The more you are engaged and invested in the Internet, the more you'll get out of the references in this movie.
3097	0	a	Gallo and Ricci? Can you possibly go wrong? Well, maybe if you tried to be conventional, but there's no danger of that here.
3098	1	a	This is a fantastic film ... Corbijn dispatches each scene like a maestro snooker player sinking balls, with power, style, and, most importantly, absolute precision. See it on the big screen.
3099	3	a	It's the wackiness of the whole thing that makes it work.
3100	2	a	Sensationally stupid, haphazardly made and qualifying as unmitigated trash by any standards, Paul Blart: Mall Cop also manages to be consistently hilarious, thanks to star Kevin James.
3101	10	a	The pun-fueled dialogue is a perfect match for the visual ugliness.
3102	3	a	There's many levels of brilliance to this film, from the script to the acting to the cinematography to the overall directing.
3103	0	a	So good it's scary.
3104	3	a	An arrested-development comedy that develops into something else altogether.
3105	1	a	Russell's films find their heroes among the men and women who respond with grace and conscience to what the Jennifer Lawrence character calls 'poisonous choices'...
3106	6	a	At the end, I felt cheated.
3107	6	a	Ultimately a forgettable entry in the young-adult genre.
3108	6	a	"Crimson Peak"" ends up feeling like a bit of make-work, a project to keep the visionary filmmaker busy until something that truly sparks his passion comes along."
3109	3	a	To say that The Dressmaker is sui generis is almost an understatement.
3110	5	a	If you're in search of a film with any real emotion or believable story, forget it. If you're OK with a flick that has some funny bits and a kooky couple playing second banana -- hey, launch on.
3111	5	a	One of the better shoot 'em up games in computing history comes to the big screen in a way that is not only near unrecognisable, but also one of the most disappointing adaptations of a game ever.
3112	6	a	Sucking all the 'classic' out of Robert Louis Stevenson's Treasure Island and filling the void with sci-fi video game graphics and Disney-fied adolescent angst...
3113	8	a	You, Me and Dupree is exactly the kind of brainless, witless junk that Hollywood knows it can peel off the scrap heap at any time and make a quick trip to the bank on.
3114	4	a	The Kings of Summer can't quite decide between dysfunctional family drama, the aesthetics of floaty Americana, Goonies-brand adventurism and outbursts of rip-roaring comedy. 
3115	2	a	It is about daydreaming and wish fulfillment, as directed by Neil LaBute.
3116	3	a	Still charming and watchable. The three leads show their comedy potential.
3117	6	a	Everything from the icy blue palette of the cinematography to the icy blue glare of its star speaks to a mood that is somber rather than hyperkinetic.
3118	1	a	Now that's more like it.
3119	0	a	Though Penn's sympathies lie with McCandless, the director's camera is impassive, and the film's driving intent is to doggedly document rather than celebrate.
3120	3	a	Exceptional tale of a family in crisis; cursing, alcoholism. 
3121	4	a	Remarkably the movie, like the couple at its center, isn't easily broken.
3122	3	a	This is one of the more exciting Disney animated features. It moves quickly and has some good, distinctive voice performances.
3123	5	a	The product of an out-of-touch filmmaker that never really gets to second base.
3124	5	a	Rising is a movie that solves a mystery no one should want solved, with more grisly crimes that spare us no detail, held together by an actor who is no Anthony Hopkins.
3125	1	a	In Project Nim Marsh is much less concerned with the scientific results of the study than he is with the behavior of the human beings involved, particularly Dr. Terrace whose behavior was, to put it mildly, not a credit to his species.
3126	3	a	It's Cage's best work in years.
3127	1	a	I, Robot is everything a summer blockbuster should be
3128	3	a	Enjoyably twisty, impressively directed thriller with great performances, a sharply written script and a pleasingly bonkers finale.
3129	4	a	This one wares out its welcome with cheesy dialogue and a longer than necessary running time, but check it out when it hits DVD or cable.
3130	4	a	The event itself is glimpsed only from a distance but, when Elliot does reach his vantage point, the view is poetically amazing. You feel the presence of Joplin and Hendrix rather than actually see them.
3131	3	a	It works simultaneously as character study, teen drama and sci-fi thriller seamlessly reconciling these elements into a hugely watchable whole.
3132	1	a	Uneven but ultimately absorbing adaptation of Dennis Lehane's best-selling novel.
3133	6	a	Even though its heart is in the right place and it boasts a strong cast, it's a case of preaching--and singing--to the choir.
3134	2	a	A relatively solid biopic with fine performances from Miles Teller and Aaron Eckhart and a great screenplay from writer/director Ben Younger.
3135	7	a	A very sterile film, one where we spend a great deal of time with the characters without ever getting to know them -- or, really, what the life of a geisha is all about.
3136	2	a	Awesome fx, poor story.
3137	3	a	People of any color can sympathize with the plight of Anthony Curtis and understand, if not agree with, the eventual choices life forces him to make.
3138	3	a	A worthy remake.
3139	6	a	"All of this leads up to a promising reveal but what we get is a great big ""huh?"
3140	9	a	Only the procession of unintentional laughs and an unflinchingly confident turn by youngster Jodelle Ferland as Lilith emerge as reasons not to bury your head in a bucket of popcorn and rue the regrettable moment a certain vault was unlocked.
3141	3	a	At times, it's like three episodes of NYPD Blue jammed together and whittled down to feature length.
3142	3	a	Tremendously lovable and funny stuff.
3143	2	a	Director Justin Lin has a spooky, second sense for staging bombastic action sequences, even if he breaks every law in physics to make them work.
3144	3	a	Of course I should know better, but the movie had me blubbering from its first down.
3145	6	a	As it turned out, the film wasn't so bad, but it wasn't much good either. It was just sort of ... there.
3146	3	a	Carol uses satire as a mask which, once cast aside, leads to ... unspoken discussions on station, gender, sexuality, and identity.
3147	2	a	The appeal of The Burial Society lays in its unusual and obscure take on an otherwise mundane tale of greed, treachery and double-cross.
3148	5	a	The Curious Case of Benjamin Button is an anodyne Hollywood film that offers a safe and sanitised view of life and death. It's Forrest Gump goes backwards.
3149	2	a	It's heart-breaking to watch, made all the more poignant by Julianne Moore's largely subdued, deeply moving performance.
3150	6	a	Chaining people to your radiator is a Wrong Thing To Do. This is not the opinion of Black Snake Moan.
3151	5	a	There's a lot of hokey fun in old pulp stories like Burroughs', but John Carter fails to capture any of that charm.
3152	2	a	Improves on the original by leaps and bounds.
3153	1	a	This has more in common with a Wong Kar-wai film than any Hollywood movie I've seen lately.
3154	1	a	In a career full of fascinating performances, this may be McDormand's most-fascinating yet.
3155	4	a	Seth MacFarlane's comedy western boasts gags galore - some a lot cruder than others. But the hits outnumber the misses.
3156	7	a	A story is too engineered for belief. 
3157	2	a	Thanks to an intriguingly nuanced performance from Australian actor Jason Clarke, Chappaquiddick does more than simply rehash why Kennedy was never able to leave the incident behind.
3158	4	a	A noir thriller about greed.
3159	4	a	Like one massive inside joke that only regulars to the View Askew Universe will get, Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back is the ultimate measure of Smith's undeniable nerdiness.
3160	6	a	A very specific film made for a very specific audience.
3161	5	a	Unappealing character driven Western set in the post-Civil War Texas.
3162	2	a	Though it's your typical formulaic violent action picture, in the model of Dirty Harry, it has more intelligence than expected.
3163	3	a	Because of Lawrence, I just can't write off this movie.
3164	3	a	Director Scott handles this knotty plot with effortless grace.
3165	0	a	It just might be one of the very best movies ever made.
3166	4	a	Scatty, intriguing but slightly undercooked ...
3167	1	a	Pardon the cliche, but it really is that rare film that will appeal to all ages.
3168	3	a	Amy Adams is a star in the making.
3169	4	a	The climax lacks the punch and satisfaction it could have delivered in a true clash of the titans.
3170	4	a	The least effective Hammer horror film featuring Christopher Lee as the fly-by-night Count.
3171	9	a	A major misfire from one of my favorite directors.
3172	6	a	Perhaps it's inevitable that this cranked-up drama wants it both ways.
3173	6	a	It isn't enough that the movie's heart and soul are in the right place. It needed edge and art to throw a punch.
3174	2	a	Boseman gives a performance both subtle and powerful, featuring a bewildering combination of supreme self-confidence, volcanic anger and emotional vulnerability. The supporting cast is also excellent.
3175	2	a	It manages to capture the way Saint Laurent's vision changed the world around him. [Full review in Spanish]
3176	4	a	Wilfully offensive and powered by a chest-thumping machismo, but it's good clean fun.
3177	1	a	This is the best action adventure movie for kids I've seen in a long, long time.
3178	6	a	A sweet-natured but awfully clumsy animated tale. Best for very young viewers.
3179	5	a	"Inside Out"" this is not... the most constructive outlet for anger is a violent bombing of the birds' adversaries, as if Ted Cruz's foreign policy advisor wrote the screenplay."
3180	3	a	You're getting what's advertised on the menu, for the better, and never the worse.
3181	5	a	If his future film choices are anything like this, Everybody Loves Raymond won't just be Romano's hit TV show. It will have to be his mantra of daily affirmation. 
3182	6	a	...[a] banal bikini-clad action/adventure...Into the Blue merely sinks aimlessly into the deep-watered depths of its Caribbean currents.
3183	2	a	Perhaps the biggest surprise comes from the fact that Soderbergh and his cast make the brothers sympathetic, rather than merely treating them with condescension. Tatum and Driver portray Jimmy and Clyde with an underlying sense of dignity.
3184	6	a	By being late to the multiplex marketplace, the film version offers little we haven't seen done before and done better.
3185	4	a	...the film takes a tonal detour, veering from indie-inflected city comedy with Woody Allen undertones to something reminiscent of the work of Nicole Holofcener.
3186	0	a	A great Broadway show becomes a great movie, thanks largely to Morse
3187	0	a	Tune in, drop out, and let this superb hippy noir wash over you.
3188	7	a	John Moore directs the hell out of the action, while Jonathan Sela's glistening photography captures the snow and rain that fall on these bloody New York streets. But you'd have to be on crack not to guess the 'surprise' finale.
3189	4	a	A film titled Eat Pray Love should at least capture a spiritual experience and offer romance with some sizzle. This felt more like Eat Grieve Befriend.
3190	1	a	Almost immediately, you sense this is going to be one of those small, carefully realized gems that exposes something true about the human experience. And it is.
3191	0	a	A film that's at once light, joyful and emotionally devastating, with deeply affecting central performances. A full-hearted romantic masterpiece.
3192	6	a	"Love, Rosie"" is one of those annoying movies in which everything would be just fine if the two central characters had a simple conversation that cleared up all their misunderstandings."
3193	9	a	It's a pointless, plodding and just plain ugly effort which fails on just about every level.
3194	6	a	A gaudy chimera with no other reason for its existence than to be flamboyant to no great end.
3195	6	a	Alba shines brightly as the beautiful, independent klutz who steals Cook's heart. Maybe fate will see to it that appearing in this movie will guarantee her next role is a winner.
3196	3	a	Worthy of its subject and the dollars of music and film fans alike. As roundly entertaining as any biopic in recent memory.
3197	4	a	There is fun to be had. Just don't expect something on a level with the director's recent work.
3198	10	a	Caligula is sickening, utterly worthless, shameful trash. If it is not the worst film I have ever seen, that makes it all the more shameful: People with talent allowed themselves to participate in this travesty.
3199	3	a	The action sequences are truly breathtaking, and Woo's attention to detail pays off in a film where computer keystrokes are as vital as huge explosions.
3200	0	a	Possibly the greatest comedy of all time, with a performance by Rosalind Russell that can only be described as 'bravura'.
3201	1	a	Space Jam is, at times, a hoot, especially when it has fun with Michael's less-than-stellar baseball career. 
3202	5	a	Buried under all this is a rather sweet story about families, but it's hard to see it amongst all the tastelessness.
3203	2	a	Defying chronology and without interviews or narration, Morgen's inventive docu is a colorful chronicle of the Democratic Convention and Conspiracy Trial perfectly tuned to our politically charged times--a call to arms that's not didactic or preachy
3204	5	a	An animated flick that doesn't leave much of an impression. It's even difficult to recall what happened once it's over because it's so slight and sluggish.
3205	1	a	The dialogue didn't feel forced; it was charming, witty and extremely relatable.
3206	7	a	A coy and hollow parody.
3207	3	a	This thriller is among the cleverest, most innovative films of the year. It proves that even a mediocre, B-movie script can be made memorable by a strong director and brave leading actor.
3208	5	a	The lack of naturalness makes everything seem self-consciously poetic and forced...It's a pity that [Nelson's] achievement doesn't match his ambition.
3209	9	a	The fifth outing in this dance film franchise is probably the most witless yet, with a narrative bereft of even an iota of plausibility and acting that's utterly out of step.
3210	3	a	This movie looks and feels superb, it is pure couture cinema. But there is also a excess of richness and bombast and for all its sleekness I felt that the spark of emotion was being hidden, and there is a kind of frustration in the operatic sadness.
3211	1	a	Imagine that the Pixar writers room dosed themselves with psychedelic drugs and went to their local supermarket to quench their munchies; the result is the perverse hilarity of Sausage Party.
3212	0	a	A poignant, meditative, meaningful, and commendable movie about the afterlife from the uniquely gifted Clint Eastwood. 
3213	3	a	This is Weinstein's first dramatic feature; he's been a documentarian, and that comes through in his ability to show Menashe in the context of his world.
3214	4	a	Fast Five's final chase sequence involving a stolen vault is, hands down, the best action sequence of the entire franchise.
3215	3	a	The movie we imagine it should be, crackling across the screen with a beat you can damn near dance to.
3216	2	a	The strong performances and Crowe's deft touch keep you invested, even if those that oppose the zoo will induce much rolling of the eyes.
3217	4	a	An inspired reinvention of the underworld.
3218	3	a	An easygoing coming-of-age movie.
3219	2	a	Spielberg knows how to tell a story and this one is worth telling.
3220	3	a	Magically, unexpectedly, most funkily, Get on Up feels fresh and crisp as the Godfather of Soul's keenest moves. 
3221	3	a	While perhaps overdependent on coincidence and contrivance, this deft thriller guards its secret right to the end and proved a fitting swan song to Fritz Lang's Hollywood career.
3222	6	a	Nothing to quack about there.
3223	4	a	We are never made to care much about the afflicted characters because Altman doesn't and thereby the stories carry very little weight.
3224	0	a	"Silver Linings Playbook,"" the exuberant new movie from David O. Russell, does almost everything right."
3225	3	a	Midnight in Paris intoxicates you, and it's hard not to fall under its spell.
3226	3	a	This digitally animated feature is not a great movie, but it is colorful, imaginative and solid entertainment. In many respects, it's more educational and more exciting than it is laugh-out-loud funny.
3227	1	a	No tightly-plotted Pixar masterpiece, Rango is its own insane expression, a nervy bundle of outrageous daring, jangled and tangled to a free-wheeling fare-thee-well. Green hasn't been this much fun since early Shrek.
3228	3	a	It's Dern's show ... all the way, and he knows it.
3229	9	a	Icky.
3230	3	a	Not only does it resurrect a nearly defunct sub-genre, but it succeeds far more than it has any right to.
3231	6	a	All the audience can do with this DOA comedy is wait for their next chance to see Robin Williams do another stand-up routine, providing a precious break in an otherwise tedious film.
3232	4	a	Jonah Hex is not a good movie. Not by a long shot... But that didn't stop me from having a hell of a lot of fun watching it.
3233	0	a	Walks the thin line of empathizing with its subject without necessarily endorsing or condoning her action.
3234	2	a	Without the proper comic nutrients, Sausage Party leaves viewers with a feeling of indigestion.
3235	3	a	Mandatory marriage counseling ruins vacation in battle-of-the-sexes sitcom.
3236	0	a	It might be contrived that way, but we are willing to forgive and accept because the path to what we expect is rewarding. 
3237	5	a	While well-crafted and beginning and ending well, for the most part it's like waiting for a tumbleweed to blow across an airless prairie.
3238	4	a	A small tale of beauty, sadness and undeniable fascination ... In a way, the film is a kind of documentary hybrid; we're seeing a story, but what we're really watching is the milieu, which has never been depicted on film before with this veracity.
3239	1	a	Vivid and colorful, this prize-winning arthouse hit, a tragic love story set against the carnival, served as a seductive introduction to Latin American culture and music.
3240	4	a	Now this is how you make a summer movie.
3241	6	a	A spelling bee. A busy bee. A killer bee. But a Seinfeld bee? Sorry Jerry, your hapless honey-seeking hero doesn't create much of an animated buzz.
3242	9	a	This is a two-star movie dragged down a star because of its unrepentant racism.
3243	9	a	"While ""Fanboys"" has an amusing premise, it doesn't know how to properly exploit it and the result is a film that is nowhere near as funny or incisive as it should have been."
3244	4	a	A captivating thriller with three solid performances
3245	3	a	This tense, gripping character study is a cleverly complex, powerful and original American tragedy. Clint Eastwood once again displays an astonishing visual sense. Problem is: it's too obvious whodunit.
3246	3	a	I knew nothing of these individuals beforehand and so it serves as an eye-opener and a fitting tribute.
3247	9	a	No amount of generosity could excuse the levels of ineptitude on display here.
3248	2	a	A triumph for the show's rabid fan base, a fun excursion for relative newcomers, and tangible proof that, sometimes, deceased shows deserve new life. 
3249	3	a	A wonderful experience but if your mind isn't open to the idea of a silent film you might want to give it a miss. There are big rewards for those willing to investigate. You might have a new appreciation for the art of filmmaking.
3250	6	a	Working from a script co-written by James, the film feels like a Die Hard parody that's at least a decade too late. It's sophomoric and rudimentary, the whole thing offering so few laughs I almost fell asleep in the theater while watching it.
3251	1	a	Into the Wild will haunt anyone willing to take the trip.
3252	3	a	This is a funny, touching and innovative piece of work with a fun performance from Jean Dujardin.
3253	0	a	Factoring in the on location filming in Paris and London, low key dialogue-speak, the multiple plot structure, and long takes, 'Hereafter' has a foreign film look and feel. 
3254	9	a	This film undoubtedly was the creation of a marketing guy who thought Tom and Jerry might become more marketable if kids heard them talk and work together.
3255	2	a	Director Martin McDonagh injects his signature brand of dark humour into the proceedings to create an absorbing portrait of how ignoble the quest for justice can be and how moral foot-stomping can often signal that something important is being overlooked.
3256	5	a	Darnell Martin's film is distinguished by some more than adequate performances but drifts through the story of the record label.
3257	4	a	"Hitchcock"" may be a muddled and shallow portrait of its actual title character, but it shines a much-deserved spotlight on the great woman behind this particular great man."
3258	2	a	wins on every level
3259	4	a	Like Friedkin's last film, Bug, this is adapted from a play by Tracy Letts, and takes place in a similarly cramped and mouldering dwelling.
3260	3	a	One of the best movies ever to come out of Canada.
3261	6	a	Each of the side stories is played out in excruciating detail and seems to exist in entirely different movies, all of which will be tied up into bows by the end.
3262	1	a	Fascinating characters...inescapably provokes consideration of the human animal's primal nature.
3263	1	a	Plenty of movies have ensnared their white heroes in the green infinity of the Amazon, but Embrace digs so deep into the void that it eventually burrows out the other side, reclaiming the wilderness as a reservoir of lost memories.
3264	3	a	This spectacularly entertaining epic takes several risks and yet, nevertheless, pays off splendidly.
3265	5	a	Moore's agit-prop is mildly amusing, but far too preachy to hold water.
3266	4	a	These are fine methods for delivering a civics lesson, which to some extent is what the Attenborough approach is all about. But for a film that aspires to entertain as well as educate, they are less helpful.
3267	2	a	An overrated John Hughes version of distinctive art house entries Call Me by Your Name and Moonlight.
3268	2	a	"Verbinski's scored an offbeat oddity, a classic Western with surreal elements and references to films from ""Chinatown"" to ""Star Wars""...If only he'd known when enough is enough..."
3269	3	a	The Farrelly brothers brand of humor is present, but the jokes are incorporated into a surprisingly effective coming-of-age story.
3270	0	a	Expect to leave exhilarated and more than a bit disturbed.
3271	5	a	Might be mistaken for an instructional video on meat-tenderizing techniques for cannibal chefs. Mel's a muscular Christian without a philosophical bone in his head.
3272	7	a	A new wrinkle in how the killings spool out actually makes the film even more predictable, and the deaths, which tend to be squirmy rather than explosive, are so perfunctory and lazily jokey that they leave a decidedly bad aftertaste.
3273	5	a	Beautifully shot thriller that gains points for sheer star power but ultimately delivers very little in terms of action, adventure or romance.
3274	3	a	Undeniably exciting and much better than a movie with this many young, buff bodies should be.
3275	0	a	The great accomplishment of Into the Wild, Sean Penn's film based on Jon Krakauer's fact-based book of the same name, is that it allows us to sympathize with Chris. We may not agree with the choices he makes, but we understand.
3276	8	a	Resident Evil is what comes from taking John Carpenter's Ghosts of Mars and eliminating the beheadings. In other words, about as bad a film you're likely to see all year.
3277	5	a	Cameo appearances by terror icons Dario Argento, Sam Raimi, and Tom Savini help make Innocent Blood a hoot for horror fans, but you don't have to be a gorehound or a vampire lover to get a kick out of the film's virulent mix of guts and guffaws.
3278	0	a	Treasure Planet moves like the story's rocket-powered flying ships taking viewers from one breath-taking adventure to another, but always making room for laughs and even some poignant life lessons.
3279	9	a	Maybe this should have been titled Night of the Living Brain Dead -- that describes the victims, describes the killers, and describes the bankrupt talents behind the butchered hack job that is this movie.
3280	3	a	No Country for Old Men is wide and dusty and terribly bleak. It's beautifully photographed and assembled, with great performances from its lead players and a number of welcome appearances by actors we haven't seen enough of lately.
3281	3	a	Horror/comedies often tread too far to one side or the other of that fine line; Tremors walks it like a tightrope.
3282	3	a	"If Cecil B. DeMille were alive today and given the chance to direct a special effects-laden fantasy adventure on Mars, he might have made something similar to Andrew Stanton's visually stunning epic ""John Carter."
3283	5	a	Disappointing horror flick, with only the Zombie Dogs and Jovovich's skimpy zombie-busting attire to recommend it.
3284	4	a	With each sequel, quality receives a KO.
3285	5	a	a cloying mess crying for another rewrite, or maybe just the quick mercy of being plunked into the nearest trash can 
3286	0	a	Sometimes a movie comes along that is so special, so out of the ordinary that you want to embrace it as tightly as a long-lost relative.
3287	4	a	The thinness of the plot -- as opposed to the sturdy themes -- and sitcom-y snap of the dialogue only tire towards the end.
3288	3	a	If you can suspend disbelief and let yourself be drawn into the movie, you'll be rewarded with an emotional and heart-warming experience that will have you cheering.
3289	3	a	If you are sans children, you may feel a little awkward walking in, but once the movie starts, you'll feel right at home.
3290	1	a	Killer Joe is America at its worst but Friedkin and McConaghey at very close to their best.
3291	3	a	How refreshing to see Spielberg rock the boat with nothing more shocking than pure old-fashioned fear
3292	1	a	Suspenseful without being manipulative, emotional without being nauseating and takes its subject absolutely seriously without being a fatuous bore.
3293	4	a	Exceeded my expectations as concerns dumbness -- and my expectations were high. This movie actually goes beyond being merely dumb; it's more like the nirvana of dumbosity.
3294	5	a	Gods and Generals will thrill die-hard Civil War buffs but it will likely leave the general public feeling as tired and weary as some of the foot soldiers in these battles.
3295	6	a	It becomes all too apparent that Smith has fallen for the same grab bag of pop culture that teen comedy producers eat with a spoon.
3296	6	a	It's enjoyable enough, but a live-action movie with a better script would have been much more engaging
3297	3	a	Nothing much happens in Welcome to Mooseport, but for a little less than two hours you can take a vacation with some very companionable people in a truly nice place.
3298	4	a	An engaging look at fifth Beatle Stuart Sutclife and his relationship with John Lennon.
3299	3	a	One of Demme's best comedies. Rent this and Something Wild and have a crazy good time.
3300	1	a	Sublime, with a touch of the ridiculous.
3301	6	a	The respective charms of Sandra Bullock and Hugh Grant have worn threadbare.
3302	6	a	A surprisingly unfunny, belabored and unimaginative comedy, Bee Movie is a huge disappointment considering the extent of Seinfeld's participation.
3303	4	a	These filmmakers do know what's funny, but they don't know when it stops being funny.
3304	0	a	Call it what you want but this movie is an instantly fond memory.
3305	4	a	The film is nicely shot and Black and Blanchett have some amusing lines.
3306	1	a	What's best about the movie is the density of its satire. Its wry social commentary permeates every aspect of the filmmaking.
3307	5	a	[Coppola's] sense of visual composition, which betrays a Gus Van Sant influence, ensures that Palo Alto remains interesting to look at even as it runs out of ideas.
3308	3	a	Serenity isn't exactly what you'd call sci-fi based on ideas, but it is a delightful, infectious blend of pulp Westerns, Star Trek, Star Wars and even samurai films.
3309	6	a	A sometimes moving, sometimes awkward blend of sentimental family drama, cancer awareness and Christian proselytizing.
3310	3	a	"A friend, after seeing Jacob's Ladder, griped, ""I wasn't afraid of dying -- until I saw this movie."" Put that blurb in an ad and see who shows up at the multiplexes."
3311	2	a	Sharply unsentimental and very funny
3312	6	a	First good, then bothersome. Excellent acting and direction.
3313	1	a	The film, however, belongs to McDormand as the wrathful mother, capable of conveying more menace with her steely gaze and set jawline than a dozen thugs waving weapons.
3314	8	a	Country Strong is a country music melodrama, but I'm not sure which country. Certainly not one with a Deep South region where songs come from the heart, not radio trending surveys, and where folks know the smell of manure means don't step in it.
3315	3	a	Diary of a Country Priest in New York State. A fine Ethan Hawke and Amanda Seyfried. Ending is a bit off the rails.
3316	0	a	"This comedic masterpiece by one of America's legendary filmmaking geniuses is a fitting companion to ""Paris, Je T'Aime"" and like a fine wine should be savored by Allen's legion of loyal cinephiles."
3317	1	a	The result is an irresistible delight.
3318	3	a	Another award worthy performance by Armand Assante that wasn't recognized. And a great song.
3319	6	a	Written by Cheryl Edwards, Kallen's story is pumped with artificial sweeteners, hokey inevitabilities, and denaturing oversimplifications.
3320	3	a	It's a reminder that the victims of war need their stories told, a responsibility that sometimes comes at the cost of the storytellers themselves.
3321	6	a	As a dramatic enterprise it's stillborn. Not to mention depressing in the extreme.
3322	6	a	The World's End, weighed down by ineffective, incoherent fight sequences and a repetitive second half, ultimately establishes itself as just another bloated and overblown summer blockbuster...
3323	3	a	While I don't like to give much credence to industry awards, if there's ever a film deserving of the attention that comes with being nominated, Guatemala's first ever Academy Awards entry is it.
3324	6	a	This is not a Sam Shepherd play; it feels more like HBO.
3325	5	a	A frantic, pointless sequel, funny in clumps, but mostly contrived and empty.
3326	9	a	How do you know when to cut your losses and go see something else?
3327	1	a	Shakes your sense of perception and leaves you spinning out of the theater in a transcendental blur.
3328	3	a	What this tense thriller lacks in action is more than made for by unpredictable twists in the plot, as well as an eerie atmosphere created by the gothic looking buildings and black and white film.
3329	5	a	Sometimes humorous, sometimes repulsive, never insightful, the movie comes off like the work of an overeager college student.
3330	6	a	This superhero saga fizzles.
3331	3	a	Menashe credits its audience with enough tenacity and intelligence to dig beneath its gentle nature and ascribe meaning to the film's subtle gestures.
3332	0	a	Thankfully, Guatemalan filmmaker Jayro Bustamante has crafted an impressive and introspective debuted gem that fuels honesty and a compelling brand of insight tip-toeing through the tunnels of cultural triumph and tragedy.
3333	3	a	You will need a bit of a sweet tooth for some of the flavour in The Light Between Oceans, but there is tremendous confidence and it is hugely watchabe. It will put you in a wobbly sort of trance.
3334	5	a	Meet the Fockers is stuck somewhere between being absolutely hilarious and one of the worst comedies ever committed to celluloid. 
3335	4	a	Never achieves the promise offered by a likable family, believably spooky townies and rich atmospherics.
3336	2	a	A slick production owes its survival to the excellent casting and acting of Brian Cranston. Never a dull moment.
3337	3	a	Brilliant except for the odd part about the adopted child and awkward ending.
3338	5	a	Incongruous vocal intonations aren't even the most significant problem plaguing Bryan Singer's film.
3339	3	a	"The Passion"" is big, physical, violent and unflinching. It's unlike any biblical film ever made and it's impossible to watch it with a trace of passivity."
3340	2	a	Unpleasant to view but ultimately satisfying.
3341	5	a	This is a film of false starts, dead ends and pointless distractions which pays too little attention to what should be its central premise.
3342	4	a	An occasionally dull, very gentle romantic drama that could have used more tension and a sharper screenplay, but it's compensated by a radiant and enchanting performance by Abbie Cornish along with exquisite cinematography.
3343	1	a	Craig is an anchor of cool rationality and judiciousness around which Mara revolves like a demon.
3344	6	a	Alas, Armored is one predictable and forgettable movie that should consider itself very lucky not to have gone straight to DVD.
3345	0	a	There are in fact no bad performances in this picture. The events depicted are often ugly and sometimes repulsive, but Cassavetes never flinches from depicting them fully
3346	3	a	Unmissable.
3347	4	a	In their efforts to make an unsilly movie about dragons, the Reign of Fire brain trust went rather too far. What they've come up with is a grim, enjoyment-impaired, postapocalyptic trudge.
3348	1	a	Team America is a poke in the nose, a kick in the pants to namby-pamby types afraid of offending anyone. It's rather liberating, which, is what Team America is all about.
3349	1	a	Remember how panicked we all were when Soderbergh said he was retiring a few years back? Thank the film gods, there's always one last heist.
3350	3	a	A surprising, off-beat entertainment.
3351	5	a	Dumb but occasionally shocking or fun.
3352	4	a	Jurassic Park III is still moderately entertaining: Pretend it's a very expensive pilot for a TV version of the DNA dinosaur adventures. With that expectation, you'll have some fun.
3353	7	a	Celtic Pride has ingredients that could have made for a tough knockabout farce. Unfortunately, the film, directed by Tom De Cerchio from a screenplay by Judd Apatow, doesn't know the meaning of the term 'light touch.'
3354	3	a	Total Recall is too much -- but it's too much of a good thing.
3355	6	a	Unfortunately, a film needs more than Diesel's Stallone-ish appeal to succeed and that's where The Last Witch Hunter is found lacking.
3356	6	a	Perfectly watchable even if it's deeply lazy filmmaking.
3357	6	a	I, Robot fails to do much of anything other than take our money and repay us with some moments of CGI-induced spectacle and a handful of rehashed ideas.
3358	3	a	The Heavy Metal of anti-war docs.
3359	0	a	This stark and grimly violent tale of humankind's insignificance in the presence of a force it is helpless to control or predict is a morality tale of existential proportions -- and with contemporary implications.
3360	9	a	bumper stickers as Descartes from a director who, until now, could have been called any number of things, but never patronizing.
3361	3	a	A gorgeous and sumptuous period love story that's a worthy addition to Todd Haynes' filmography.
3362	3	a	A fiercely clever and subtle film, capturing the precarious balance between the extravagant confidence of the exiled aristocracy and the cruel earnestness of the victorious revolutionaries.
3363	3	a	The work of a filmmaker and team of writers so conscious of their own formulaic crutch that they demand a production that feels like more than the sum of its parts.
3364	5	a	Man of the Year starts out funny -- at least that's the intention -- and then morphs into a kind of paranoid thriller. Neither one of the movie's split personalities is particularly good.
3365	6	a	Most of Entrapment plays out in head-scratching 'Huh? Why? Eh?' moments.
3366	1	a	The film isn't just a portrayal of the battle between the old and the new. It's a lament for the ways in which they reflect each other...
3367	2	a	It's not a great film, but parts of it are outstanding.
3368	3	a	A hugely enjoyable, warm-hearted romantic comedy-drama with a refreshing honesty towards its subject matter and a pair of terrific performances from Bradley Cooper and Jennifer Lawrence.
3369	4	a	To quote an SNL sketch featuring costar and producer Will Ferrell, I don't think that legally this qualifies as cinema.
3370	6	a	Superficial but giddily entertaining.
3371	1	a	Director David Fincher has turned out an overlong, Forrest Gumpian exercise in mannered whimsy. It's sentimental; it's episodic; it dawdles. Brad Pitt spends a good length of screen time drinking tea with Tilda Swinton. But it's also bewitching.
3372	9	a	Basically only for completists looking to see Jason take center stage for the first time. [Blu-ray]
3373	4	a	The requisite apprehensions about turning a story of only a few pages into a film of feature length are promptly dispatched -- or, well, protractedly dispatched.
3374	5	a	To gaze upon the film, like Frodo staring into that prophetic magic orb, is to be shaken by a dark vision of cinema's future.
3375	8	a	...not so much a story as a victory lap...
3376	3	a	Brisseau is getting at the heart of human nature and the price of ambition, and he's cutting with a sharp knife, revealing all of its entrails whether you like it or not
3377	3	a	Disney's strongest CG animated effort to date can be credited to the strength of a premise that mixes what's worked so well in earlier Disney animated films with a better awareness of what makes a movie entertaining both for kids and adults.
3378	5	a	Aliens In The Attic is a movie solely aimed at children and it does exactly what it sets out to do. It's nothing more than a harmless comedy for kids and tweenagers chock full of slapstick comedy, cute-as-pie aliens and appealing child stars.
3379	6	a	Brian De Palma's exercise in flashy paranoia and shallow cynicism comes out of the gate like gangbusters, but falls apart in a flurry of preposterous plotting.
3380	1	a	After Winslet's amazing performances in The Reader and Revolutionary Road, it's quite possible -- and maybe even likely -- that she'll get two Oscar nominations this year.
3381	6	a	A cobbled-together mess of conflicting tones.
3382	4	a	While kids will probably eat the whole thing up, most adults will be way ahead of the plot.
3383	0	a	This might not be the first movie to get inside the mind of an addict, but it's the only one that captures the life-consuming power of addiction in all its complexity.
3384	9	a	If, as the ads would lead you to believe, you go to see The Break-Up expecting a romantic comedy, you will be severely disappointed. If you go to it expecting a good movie, you will also be severely disappointed.
3385	1	a	Gus Van Sant's capper to a trilogy of experiments in elliptical narrative and lyrical structure is a masterful triumph of art, craft and empathy for the complicatedness of being a real teenager.
3386	4	a	A nostalgic romp through horror mythology.
3387	3	a	Kate Winslet is an absolute goddess in this hilarious, moving and very dark Australian dramedy based on the bestselling novel by Rosalie Ham.
3388	3	a	"Plaza, of TV's ""Parks and Recreation"" fearlessly puts it all out there as a teen put out that she hasn't ""put out."
3389	2	a	Cumberbatch deserved a stronger movie, but at least Tyldum had the good sense to let him loose. Few actors can portray intelligence in a way that honors the audience's own.
3390	1	a	A Most Wanted Man is a mercurial puzzle; it's espionage done right from the right source material.
3391	2	a	Captures the excitement of rodeos.
3392	3	a	Edge of Seventeen hits the pubescent nail soundly on the head with a sureness of touch that easily makes it one of the best and most honest films thus far about the turmoil, delights and utter confusion of the teenage years.
3393	3	a	In addition to the expected shots of Ali and Don King in all their megalomania, the intimate portraits of James Brown, Bill Withers, and B.B. King in his triumphant homecoming are as powerful as their performances.
3394	1	a	Because the movie is exemplary on a number of levels -- the production design is immaculate, and the cast members consign themselves to Nolan's dark vision -- it doesn't need to live or die solely on the strength of the script's cinematic sleight of hand.
3395	6	a	Letters to Juliet represents an interesting paradox: it is a movie that is very nearly perfect without being especially good.
3396	1	a	Even if you've never seen a Hitchcock film in your life, it's worth seeing for the performances alone.
3397	9	a	Its messages of anti-bullying, befriending losers, and pretending the fat kid stuffing Ho-hos into his mouth doesn't make you sick are as timeless as they are trite.
3398	0	a	One would presume that a behind-the-scenes look at the process of naming a new Pontiff would provide ample fodder for observational humor. 
3399	4	a	The movie brings back all the emotional flotsam of youth, and lets the viewer scavenge the debris for lost treasure.
3400	5	a	Sommersby is not a terrible movie, there are just many things about it that aren't quite right.
3401	6	a	Screenwriter Kevin Bisch emphasizes tired jokes and stock situations over anything resembling reality, something that's exacerbated by a seriously overlong running time.
3402	5	a	Fairly desperate military comedy.
3403	4	a	While there's nothing WRONG with this trifle, I was hoping there'd be a better finale for the company that more than anyone was the face of moving drawings for the world...
3404	2	a	It's briskly entertaining as a mystery, and such a pleasing revival that it's not even that frustrating when the film concludes on more than one bit of unfinished business.
3405	5	a	Bad, but not uninteresting
3406	6	a	Although trying to balance self-referential humor and a normal ol' slasher plot seemed like a decent endeavor, the result doesn't fully satisfy either the die-hard Jason fans or those who can take a good joke.
3407	0	a	I've seen the best cloak-and-danger exercises, including The Spy Who Came in From the Cold and the original Day of the Jackal, and in terms of story and cold-sweat suspense, I'd rank this one right up there.
3408	6	a	It's nice to see this story onscreen, but frustrating to watch it try to have it both ways on virtually every plot point. 
3409	9	a	It took five writers to come up with this. The mind reels.
3410	9	a	Irritating characters, little semblance of a plot, weak gags, and sub-par performances ... result in a film that doesn't even have enough going on to interest a five-year-old.
3411	0	a	The end result is a film that is pretty much a total delight from top to bottom and even if you don't think that it is the kind that you might normally go for, it turns out that it really is.
3412	5	a	It comes to the 'startling' conclusion that rich kids might do the same bad things working-class kids do, but get away with it because their money gives them privileges.
3413	6	a	A triumph of high-concept but low-ambition filmmaking.
3414	3	a	Like The Bad News Bears but with much higher stakes.
3415	9	a	What does it say about a film with an hour running time that has twenty minutes of outtakes after the credits to reach theatrical length? Very little that's positive.
3416	3	a	"The only real ""cerebral"" activity that should take place in a zombie movie is the consumption of brains by the heretofore mentioned zombies themselves."
3417	3	a	Families will flock to and enjoy this movie, but it's likely only adults will really get it.
3418	6	a	An absurdly profane comedy that spends its entire time serving up filthy jokes and then trying to top them.
3419	0	a	Apatow's cockeyed Citizen Kane, merging goofball, pothead jokes with a plausible story of unshakable relationship discomfort; a broad mismatch of personalities and body shapes glued together by the cruelty of insemination.
3420	4	a	This drama is unabashedly preachy but satisfying nevertheless.
3421	3	a	Hancock is a rarity. It's an action yarn that feels like a drama and, alternately, a drama that takes our breath away with bursts of eye-popping action.
3422	3	a	Very funny and deeply charming, Midnight in Paris is a living dream about feeling at home somewhere else, with someone else.
3423	8	a	Hardcore masterpiece.
3424	2	a	Ignore the naysayers, this is a very enjoyable action adventure
3425	2	a	Big Bang Theory fans [should] transport . . . to a similarly charming story of endearing nerds and the practical companions drawn into their skewed orbit.
3426	6	a	It has such a nihilistic nature and lack of resolution that rather than high stakes, there's nothing at stake.
3427	5	a	Against the odds of a feeble script and uninspired direction the duo do, in fact, grow on you, and there are a smattering of silly laughs.
3428	0	a	A love for films shines through each frame and the era is recreated with obvious affection, scored to perfection with some tasty boogaloo beats.
3429	9	a	It's not that Gods and Generals is almost four hours long. It's that it's four hours of bad.
3430	6	a	At a certain point the movie is grounded by its director's grave approach.
3431	3	a	A grossly underrated horror film with an intriguing premise and foreboding atmosphere.
3432	2	a	While it doesn't get the grandest of treatment and can't seem to dig deeper than the obvious, Chappaquiddick does serve as a cautionary tale of what Americans have let slide in favor of celebrity and status. 
3433	7	a	"[VIDEO ESSAY] If intellectual sarcasm is your thing, you might like ""Cosmopolis."" Either way, the movie is too pretentious for its own good. "
3434	3	a	Kore-eda has made a career of family stories focused on youth, some of them heartbreakingly bleak. Here he uses a much lighter brush, creating a picture that is simpler than most, and all the more beautiful for it.
3435	4	a	Features moments of profound emotional impact but also struggles with jarring tonal shifts that nearly undermine the film's power.
3436	0	a	"Pauline at the Beach"" is an acerbic study of romantic power games that the sexes play, and the destructive influence they have. It is a film that's easy to love. "
3437	4	a	Intriguing and obliquely involving.
3438	1	a	"Hazanavicius has perfectly captured the look and feel of the silent era with ""The Artist."
3439	4	a	...basically just sits there for a good long hour before it picks up any sensible speed. Is it all worth it, though? In ways.
3440	3	a	There's a new action hero in town, and I'm sorry Yoda, but he isn't a CGI midget with bad hygiene and Miss Piggy's voice.
3441	3	a	Way too long and could have easily been trimmed by a good half hour, but it turns a new corner in [Sean Penn's] career as a filmmaker
3442	5	a	stumbles out of the gate, falls, and never rights itself. For the Halloween offering that its studio hoped it would be, it's all trick and no treat.
3443	6	a	No one can tell a coherent story anymore, and before long no one will notice.
3444	4	a	It's still very much a quick and painless Hollywood production, what slight genius there is in its premise dulled by the sheen of the high production values and its prettier-than-pretty cast.
3445	6	a	An unpolished string of events oversimplified in television-movie fashion.
3446	5	a	In spite of the title, the film doesn't want to take us to too many dark places. In fact, it manages the unlikely feat of making a nightmarish, futuristic world seem a bit like a summer camp.
3447	6	a	Not the worst adventure flick that I've ever seen, but far from a great one either.
3448	4	a	A nice gift for Firefly fans, but not quite as good for the rest of us.
3449	4	a	There's no denying the subject matter is compelling, and the heightened sense of tension goes a long way toward redeeming the film.
3450	3	a	Has a profound cumulative effect by the end--a testament not only to Penn's control and understanding of the material, but the terrific lead turn by Hirsch.
3451	2	a	A high-end version of one of those direct-to-video kids' movies that play on the Disney Channel all throughout October, all cobwebbed tombstones behind iron cemetery gates and dead leaves crunching underfoot.
3452	5	a	Slapstick, but gross-out humor.
3453	3	a	The new comedy version of Freddy...
3454	5	a	"Larry Crowne"" is an inside-out movie, acceptable around the edges but hollow and shockingly unconvincing at its core."
3455	5	a	A really tired affair.
3456	2	a	A visually spectacular and surprisingly heartfelt story that dives into the emotional ties shared between creator, creation and its inhabitants/users.
3457	10	a	An even more lame-brained sitcom than that in which director Brian Robbins starred many eons ago.
3458	6	a	It's got enough melodrama and full-volume diva-meltdown histrionics to blow a movie like Burlesque out of the water.
3459	1	a	Payne remains a deeply humanist filmmaker: He loves people no matter their flaws, and he once again conveys that sympathy through a beautiful, haunting film that initially feels slight but grows large in your memory.
3460	1	a	An unflinching film, The Grey Zone takes us right into the gas chambers.
3461	3	a	For as visually arresting as it is, the fact that Ralph Breaks the Internet firmly puts you inside the heads and hearts of the characters is its most impressive accomplishment.
3462	4	a	a little stiff but still good
3463	1	a	a fun b-movie flicka
3464	3	a	Intelligent and uncompromising, with knock-out performances from Downey Jr. and Foxx.
3465	3	a	The material is presented with so much warmth and affection, it's almost impossible to resist.
3466	6	a	"Tonal inconsistencies sink ""The Dressmaker,"" and the same applies to Winslet's character."
3467	7	a	The film's premise -- that the savvy student played by Charlotte Ayanna would get involved with this creep -- is a stretch at best.
3468	2	a	Story and characters leave much to be desired, but there's something wonderful about this refreshingly gritty, innovative animated feature.
3469	4	a	All those CGI snakes can be quite shudder-inducing. But there is also something cheerfully ridiculous in the way the film switches to rubber snakes for hand-to-hand combat.
3470	4	a	Who would have imagined that a biopic about Jesse James could be so boring?
3471	9	a	Ridiculously tired.
3472	6	a	It's a handsome film, but the pace is continually gummy and the set-ups stiff and artificial. Most crucially, nothing in it vanquishes the sensation that we're being sold something superfluous.
3473	4	a	Fantastic Four is actually very true to its source material - often literally so - but generally misses the spirit entirely.
3474	5	a	The film's few chuckles can be chalked up to the sheer comedic charisma of McCarthy and Bateman.
3475	2	a	Despite the Ed Gein and love story MacGuffins, 'Hitchcock' makes for a 'good evening.'
3476	3	a	A lucid, nuanced and compelling telling of the accident and its turbulent aftermath.
3477	9	a	Ziyi is radiant, as real as the script allows -- just not Japanese. Sweetly shot overall, though a dismal mood dominates. Otherwise somewhat simple and soapy.
3478	3	a	Heathers really is odd, like a mix of something by Stephen King and Bret Easton Ellis...
3479	3	a	Freeman goes only so far with a dialect, and the script barely gets into Mandela's complexities, but the performance feels fresh and spontaneous. Damon is becoming one of the truest, most reliable actors of his generation.
3480	2	a	With its sweat glistening off tanned muscles mannerism and hard-nosed bare knuckle bravado, Fast Five is the perfect cure for a Spring season filled with failed attempts at recapturing past glories.
3481	1	a	This is a beautifully crafted story that takes us on quite the journey of exploration and discovery.
3482	4	a	The basically good -- though not very inspired -- Barnyard just stirred up a lot of 'been there, done that' feelings in me as I watched this film.
3483	4	a	While the viewer will remain one step ahead of the story at all times, director Christian Alvart manages to keep the emotionally charged events moving at a fair clip to gloss over the mounting credibility factors.
3484	3	a	Incredibly powerful and often moving, anchored by an awards-worthy performance from Oyelowo.
3485	1	a	Soderbergh isn't exactly hiding a secret drama inside his barrel of laughs and twists. But his comeback project keeps quiet about being one of the sweetest, most affirming movies he's ever made.
3486	7	a	Offensively violent, casually heartless, and often clueless to just how routine it is.
3487	3	a	Chappaquiddick doesn't solve the mystery, and some of its scenes are invented. But it gives a vivid sense of the people to whom history happened.
3488	4	a	Perhaps worst of all are the limited expectations Coppola has for her own heroine. It's hard to love a movie where a woman finds herself from the passenger seat.
3489	4	a	It's a movie that's, mostly, a soundtrack. But, good lord, still. What a soundtrack.
3490	3	a	There's a lot to like here and with strong performances all-around, a fresh script with characters that sound and act real. Add this film to your essential Oscar viewing game plan.
3491	4	a	fairly competent but standard action fare - Better than CLIFFHANGER but not as good as THE EIGER SANCTION
3492	4	a	An intriguing and timely satire about the increasingly insidious ways consumer culture tries to keep us spending even when we can't afford it.
3493	4	a	All the intense, pent up passion between Benjamin and Daisy which kept the film so taut and engrossing for an hour and a half is a mortifying drain once they unite and are free to express their devotion.
3494	4	a	The story is cleverly worked.
3495	6	a	Harlin's version at least had cheap thrills -- Schrader's has none.
3496	3	a	Scary premise of mad sitter vs mother and child...effective.
3497	1	a	It's a rarity, a comedy about young adults that does not laugh at their inexperience, and remains accessible even to old fogies.
3498	6	a	a carbon copy sequel
3499	6	a	'Corn, corn, nothin' but corn,' Duvall complains as he looks at his crops; unsympathetic viewers will feel they can relate...
3500	2	a	The perfect family film in every way, moms, dads, kids and even those Martians are gonna love this funny, warm and wonderful tale.
3501	5	a	There's barely a laugh to be found in this new comedy from Horrible Bosses director Seth Gordon.
3502	6	a	At least it will not suck anybody's will to live.
3503	4	a	The plot and the details are cartoonish, not psychological. Now, with that in mind, Air Force One is pretty good.
3504	1	a	An extraordinary portrait of a life lived always in the shadow of despair.
3505	6	a	The final image -- a freeze frame of a pas de deux staged to resemble a triumphal Communist poster -- perfectly captures the film's overall effect: it's strenuously brainless. 
3506	3	a	Once Heigl sells us on why she might not outrightly reject the man of her nightmares and delineates a character who might take a sort of let's see approach, we detect the charm of her interpretation and the possibilities of the premise.
3507	4	a	The gag wouldn't work with just anyone in the lead, but Adams' openhearted performance never winks. She really does want the best for everyone, and can't fathom why they don't all feel the same.
3508	3	a	As undemanding summer movies go, America's Sweethearts is surprisingly funny and sweet, despite some missed comic opportunities and curious casting choices.
3509	3	a	The triumph here is that Hanson and screenwriter Scott Silver have found a fresh way to tell this story.
3510	0	a	Guadagnino has coaxed from his cast a film unmatched this year for lifelike rhythms and attention to human behavior.
3511	5	a	A soapy heartstring fiddler ...
3512	6	a	The movie has a handful of things that will make it worth watching on cable, someday.
3513	5	a	Unfortunately, it takes a sharp detour and goes down the action route, which ends up misfiring. 
3514	5	a	The weakest entry in a series lacking in solid entries.
3515	7	a	The film isn't campy enough to be fun or smart enough to be good, but it passes by quickly and without doing any serious harm to the viewer.
3516	3	a	Donnie Darko may be too ambitious for a debut feature, but ambition and imagination still trump mediocrity any day of the week.
3517	5	a	Ironically, it's Foxx's gift for mimicry--the same skill that made him a perfect Ray Charles--that defeats him here.
3518	0	a	An instant classic.
3519	6	a	Without looking it up, I'm guessing the title is Latin for drudgery.
3520	2	a	Lustrous
3521	3	a	A slight, but enjoyable, Disney animated feature comprised of two cartoons linked together by host Jiminy Cricket.
3522	7	a	Lanie, who suggests a blow-dried human Q-tip, is so jarring on the eyes, it's difficult to concentrate on the story.
3523	0	a	In the span of three films Craig has made the character his own
3524	3	a	Bruce Beresford delivers one of his best films in the story of Chinese ballet star Li Cunxin.
3525	2	a	A purposefully disjointed, pretentious, philosophical, and deeply stylized journey through an exaggerated commentary on the haves, the have-nots, and those stuck in the middle. 
3526	4	a	Alba? We'd follow her anywhere, especially Into the Blue.
3527	4	a	An unabashed B movie: basic, brutal and sometimes clumsy, but far from dumb, and not bad at all.
3528	2	a	Reminds us that silent films aren't inferior to sound ones, just a little different.
3529	0	a	As much a poignant meditation on motherhood lost as a searing indictment of the Catholic Church's antiquated attitude about what might be in the best interests of an adopted child.
3530	3	a	John Dahl knows the secrets to making a great B-grade fright flick.
3531	0	a	...a bittersweet celebration of romantic frisson - the notion that our most precious moments of connection are often the fleeting ones.
3532	4	a	There's one other way to approach Matchstick Men, and that's to forget all about neuroses and con artistry and admire the movie instead for the unsettlingly beautiful directorial study in geographical mood that it is.
3533	4	a	A handsomely produced and generally well-acted film that favours philosophical, scientific and religious discussions over rampant toga tussling and sword slicing.
3534	6	a	It's so sad that Phoenix went out not with a bang but with this whimper.
3535	4	a	Much of the movie feels dull or derivative.
3536	3	a	In a way, I was almost hoping that the three storylines didn't tie together at the end. Each of them stands so firmly on its own.
3537	0	a	A symphony in the language of film. The Curious Case of Benjamin Button is simultaneously uplifting, devastating, and achingly human.
3538	6	a	By turns thoughtful, awkward and lacking in chemistry, the movie ultimately sticks to the rom-com template without making the outcome matter.
3539	2	a	"Mr. Cronenberg's direction throughout ""Cosmopolis"" is impeccable, both inside the limo and out."
3540	2	a	A highly scathing jolt of relationship reality.
3541	5	a	A ponderous tale of envy and one-upmanship that promises much but in the end delivers surprisingly little...seriously short of cinematic magic.
3542	5	a	Not an ideal Chan vehicle but, on the other hand, it gains a lot from his ecstatic presence. 
3543	4	a	"The burly Lustig has a melancholy quality - he plays ""himself"" as a fellow with a good heart, but one who's become a little too comfortable with failure."
3544	0	a	Schindler's List is a film whose meanings are to be found less in its uplifting outline than in its harrowing flow of images -- images of fear, hope, horror, compassion, degradation, chaos, and death.
3545	4	a	The subtlety that's missing from the filmmaking can still be found in the honest, affecting portrayals by both Harris and Gooding.
3546	2	a	Matt Damon again pulls off a great mix of inscrutability and vulnerability.
3547	4	a	Memo to Hollywood: Give John a real movie to direct. Please.
3548	5	a	A handsomely made but tonally uncertain film; it's unsure whether to be an old-fashioned inspirational heartwarmer, or a paranoid prose-poem about ruined lives on the city's dangerous margins.
3549	9	a	Wild Wild West is a comedy dead zone. You stare in disbelief as scenes flop and die. The movie is all concept and no content; the elaborate special effects are like watching money burn on the screen.
3550	8	a	Does LaBute feel any sympathy for his victimized women, or merely contempt for their weakness?
3551	4	a	It does have the limitations of the form: selective memory and admiring treatment that errs on the side of its subject. But Resurrection also humanizes Shakur even as it enshrines him and soft-pedals some difficult questions.
3552	9	a	The most chopped up, stitched together Frankenstein job in recent memory. 
3553	3	a	An old fashioned survival yarn, beautifully shot and well-told. 
3554	4	a	Pleasantly regressive big monster flick.
3555	6	a	the essence of cool
3556	7	a	This one, like its characters, takes too few risks.
3557	5	a	I wanted to be moved. Really, I did. A lot. Instead, I left cold. 
3558	4	a	The popcorn thriller manages to keep the viewer's disbelief at bay, while offering a deceptively smooth ride through some frequently bumpy territory.
3559	3	a	An enjoyable teen comedy with likeable characters, a witty script, strong performances and some great tunes - this is the film the High School Musical movies should have been.
3560	6	a	What it really boils down to is I wanted a Mandela movie with a little rugby and got a rugby movie with a little Mandela.
3561	4	a	It's too formulaic, too efficient at simply whisking you through and making sure you've clocked the diversity message.: without square pegs - like those played by Cumberbatch and Knightley - the world would be by far the poorer.
3562	9	a	Wilmer Valderrama and George Takei's reaction shots are the only feeble sources of humor in this dramedy.
3563	4	a	A frenetic kids' film that is chock-full of madcap energy, throwaway sight gags and very silly puns, Angry Birds should most please those who are willing to relinquish their cynicism and go with the flow.
3564	2	a	The ensemble cast creates a really fun atmosphere by embracing the blatant ridiculousness of the films. And isn't that what enjoying a big, dumb action movie is all about?
3565	9	a	A hideously annoying and emotionally blank tale.
3566	6	a	Aliens in the Attic is inoffensively mediocre, bereft of subtext and depth but too playful to get terribly bent out of shape about its shortcomings. It could have been a whole lot better, but it also could have been a great deal worse.
3567	5	a	Bottom of the barrel Spielbergiana
3568	4	a	Gladiator is a flawed motion picture, and one that, for all its flashiness, comes off as a mild disappointment. It is still a good film, but only marginally so, and easily could have been a great one.
3569	1	a	A buoyant comedy that contains moments of pathos, this silent black-and-white movie recalls Singin' in the Rain but possesses a reverence that's endearingly French.
3570	3	a	Gets off to a decent start for this next trilogy, but it's not the epic, genre-redefining event of the one that preceded it.
3571	0	a	New York never looked as thrillingly sordid as it does in this scabrous masterpiece.
3572	6	a	Illiterate, often inert sci-fi action thriller.
3573	1	a	The quality of small films currently playing in town is rather extraordinary at this moment. Rejoice that Three Billboards is one of them.
3574	0	a	Run out and see this baby.
3575	5	a	Passion might be a courageous, visceral, boldly artistic motion picture, but that it doesn't make a very convincing dramatic experience.
3576	5	a	click to read full review [Greek]
3577	4	a	You, Me and Dupree may elicit some chuckles throughout, but the premise tires before the film runs its course.
3578	9	a	...couldn't get a laugh from a hyena.
3579	3	a	Jean Dujardin is ready for a game between eras: his chatty smile and way of moving connect with the great adventurous gallant of silent American cinema. [Full Review in Spanish] 
3580	2	a	A gentle and emotional movie; frequently hilarious and consistently honest. [Full review in Spanish]
3581	3	a	Although its humor is not for all tastes, no one can say this crazy picture doesn't have the guts to live up to its title.
3582	1	a	The movie makes a claim that can't be matched by many Bond films: It's actually about something.
3583	3	a	A sometimes average film elevated above and beyond by its leads.
3584	0	a	Three Billboards outside Ebbing, Missouri is an empathetic view of humanity at its best, its worst, and, as is most often the case in this world, everything in between.
3585	6	a	[Glenn Close] does an exemplary job of giving a surface-level performance, which is the kind of praise that no matter how generously it is meant, just won't come out sounding like a compliment.
3586	1	a	This is one of the better Bond films in the franchise.
3587	1	a	Cate Blanchett and Rooney Mara take us inside a passionate story of desire and retribution that's both satisfying and disturbing.
3588	9	a	The epitaph of the modern spoof.
3589	10	a	This film is awful in too many ways to count.
3590	2	a	"Though ""Hitchcock"" provides little new insight into the man of its title, it is valuable for finally giving the woman behind the man her due."
3591	4	a	The garments are beautiful, evocative, and specific, rich in texture and in meaning alike. 
3592	4	a	A near miss by director/screenwriter Penn when he mistakes a self-absorbed college student for a hero of the counter culture
3593	3	a	Merciless and darkly funny.
3594	3	a	Paul Blart: Mall Cop is a slapstick comedy with a hero who is a nice guy. I thought that wasn't allowed anymore.
3595	5	a	Director Barry Levinson gives the movie a gritty veneer of realism and sun-baked menace, but Mitch Glazer's script is limp, unconvincing and vaguely distasteful, even despicable-a facile fantasy of stardom among honor-killing savages.
3596	5	a	There's a certain poetic irony in the fact that Figgis' production company is called Red Mullet, because the supposed red herrings tossed into this non-mystery are mullet indeed.
3597	1	a	A solidly made, genuinely creepy and effective ghost story of a type the movies rarely attempt and even more rarely get right.
3598	4	a	Falls neatly into the category of Good Stupid Fun.
3599	3	a	Terrific fun, a sequel with more self-assurance than most original films can muster.
3600	3	a	"Skyfall"" is so good you almost forget it is a James Bond movie."
3601	4	a	The nature photography is excellent, and real-life husband and wife McKenna and Travers are very good, their genuine affection transferring to the screen.
3602	3	a	Outstanding drama. Actually makes a case for adultery. You really feel for them and get sucked into this quiet world.
3603	4	a	It's a superior model of library-card nostalgia.
3604	3	a	Team America: World Police is controversial, vulgar, and politically incorrect. Bless Parker and Stone for making it. 
3605	6	a	It's sporadically entertaining but never amounts to more than Mediocre Four.
3606	0	a	A triumph for the offbeat, grimly funny brothers, it reveals in its mythic fashion the vagaries of the creative process that plague every artist.
3607	4	a	Not as good a smoke as the first, but worth a puff.
3608	3	a	Although the characters are like those in the original books rather than the exuberantly coloured cartoon versions, the warmth you feel from them all is nothing short of delightful.
3609	7	a	"The film has elements of Hitchcock and, most of all, George Franju's far, far superior ""Eyes Without a Face,"" but ""The Skin I Live In"" is structurally rickety."
3610	2	a	...it can't distract us from how familiar the story feels, even if you know nothing at all about Brown. What makes the film worth seeing are the two lead performances. 
3611	4	a	Intense relationship drama for adults only.
3612	3	a	Is it trash or art? Maybe it's a bit of both. It's certainly one of the most 'alive' films out there.
3613	4	a	The movie is so elegant, actually, that it feels a little musty, and while its atmosphere is spectacular, its story is a bit stale.
3614	3	a	...the picture mistakes opulence for importance. It's like a geisha who is all dressed up with no place to go.
3615	0	a	Egoyan's masterpiece -- a twisting tale of erotic obsession and hypnotic storytelling.
3616	3	a	Fast-paced romp has violence, gangsters, drugs. 
3617	4	a	One thing's for sure: loving thy neighbour will be a darned sight harder after this.
3618	6	a	"The Lazarus Effect"" boasts nothing special. It's not going to provide much relief for horror-starved audiences."
3619	0	a	Carol is a truly striking cinematic achievement, artfully exploring themes that resonate still with powerful force today.
3620	3	a	The kind of boot-strap-pulling, tear-duct-tickling, I-am-Spartacus-crowing movie-on-a-mission that might rankle more cynical movie goers but sets hearts aflutter for most everyone else.
3621	4	a	For the millions that pick up the newspaper each night and ask, 'How could someone do such a thing,' Monster provides some answers.
3622	0	a	It loosens the shackles of a post-Pixar/post-Blue Sky animation landscape, where family entertainment must either be an emotional roller coaster or mindless slapstick.
3623	4	a	What was deeply moving on the printed page seems mechanically melodramatic when dramatized in Derek Cianfrance's film. You want to be moved but can't shake the feeling that mostly you're being manipulated.
3624	3	a	Black Snake Moan is a myth-and-reconciliation story with outlandish scenes meant to make you laugh, make you uncomfortable. Both.
3625	2	a	...may not be a weighty take on its subject, but the script is full of well-earned laughs, including one of the best closing lines of the year.
3626	3	a	It puts a smile on your face and you can't resist the charming nature of the film.
3627	2	a	McGregor, in his directorial debut, does well to juggle both the family drama as well as the bigger events playing out in the background without resorting to preachiness or a need to tie everything up neatly.
3628	3	a	People who go to see Jurassic Park III are not there for character development, they want cool-looking dinosaurs, and that they will get in spades.
3629	3	a	Impressive, unique, and inspiring.
3630	4	a	The acting is passable, the dialogue is serviceable and occasionally clever, and darned if it's not an adrenaline-booster all the way around.
3631	4	a	Another tale about how suburban domesticity is miserable simply because it's marriage and it's the suburbs.
3632	3	a	It's a genre picture bathed in overwhelming darkness and torment.
3633	5	a	If the restless children in the movie theatre are any indication, the movie is just as uninteresting for them as it is tiresome for the adults.
3634	2	a	This probably isn't the way you remembered the tale -- set amidst sweaty dancers at Carnaval -- but it's certainly, well, different.
3635	9	a	Anyone paying to see it in Brooklyn or anywhere else for that matter will probably leave the theater angrier than the film's title character. 
3636	4	a	While there is an underlying existential anxiety to the whole thing, there's not enough pizzazz to either the visuals or the dialogue to make It Comes at Night worth going to see in the theater.
3637	10	a	This deeply unfunny film is further proof that movie comedy these days -- in its acting, writing, directing -- is far below the average sitcom.
3638	3	a	This is a rare thing - a comedy for both him and her.
3639	2	a	"First Reformed"" is Ethan Hawke's film and the actor gives a richly textured performance of a man at an important crossroad in his life."
3640	0	a	A Beautiful Mind, this film thankfully isn't. Don't let anyone tell you otherwise.
3641	1	a	'Screwball' is a slang term for 'crazy,' and perhaps this is what inspired writer-director David O. Russell to literalize as well as update the screwball comedy genre here...
3642	0	a	David O. Russell deploys his deranged genius to explore the real events behind Abscam, cleverly focussing on the inter-relationships rather than the details of the elaborate sting operation.
3643	0	a	People who see it may feel like dancing out of the theater afterward. Go for it.
3644	0	a	It's one of the all-time great feel good films, but its sly cultural commentary is what makes it the masterpiece that it is.
3645	3	a	It does at least come across as a portrait of an era that's affectionate, authentic and pleasingly adult in its tone and concerns.
3646	4	a	A psychotic Sophie's Choice. Much more a gruesome tale of revenge than it is a suspense thriller along the lines of Harris' earlier Red Dragon or The Silence of the Lambs.
3647	2	a	A surprisingly effective thriller, featuring good-to-great performances and a taut, interesting screenplay with enough twists and turns to keep the audience entertained for its scant running time.
3648	3	a	It's stirring scattershot stuff, made with a fine eye for period detail and an evident passion for the music, which remains the driving force throughout.
3649	3	a	The performances are an understated joy, particularly Brosnan, who convinces as the not-quite-romantic interest, and Kinnear, who makes goodness believable.
3650	0	a	Terrifically acted, superbly written and masterfully directed by the Coen Brothers, this is an incredibly suspenseful thriller that looks set for Oscar glory come February.
3651	2	a	When the Torah is explained in mathematical terms, it's enough to make you want to take up second year trig - like the movie, a deeply flawed idea.
3652	4	a	It manifests a mounting sense of disillusionment, suggesting that the rodeo lifestyle many characters so unreservedly romanticize often leads to physical and psychological ruin.
3653	2	a	It's a film that just keeps getting stronger as it goes, unfolding almost imperceptibly and becoming deeper with each scene.
3654	6	a	A film that's nowhere near as fantastic as it should be. Something's missing. And that something is most likely a strong director.
3655	3	a	Although there are some minor problems in the script and storytelling plus the characters seem assembled from the Disney cookie-cutter conveyor belt the kids won't mind.
3656	2	a	The film's overall upbeat tempo and eventful complications made for an entertaining watch.
3657	4	a	The movie isn't completely unlikeable, but it's not for Chan connoisseurs.
3658	3	a	Neatly, the script embarks on one journey while dangling the possibility of another: the prospect of taking a sudden leap from comic reality into the realm of pure imagination.
3659	5	a	Paddling upstream with a mystery that's not terribly convincing, focusing on characters simply deployed for oddity, and welcoming an indulgent run time that's bruising when the picture stops for no reason whatsoever.
3660	6	a	When life hands you lemons, make a wild mushroom-and-human cheek brochette with meat carved from the decapitated head of the war criminal who ate your sister.
3661	4	a	Like going to a fun fear.
3662	4	a	'Cadillac Records' has the talent and the music that should propel audiences to come see where the heart of rock and roll started.
3663	1	a	Woody Harrelson provides the humor, the teens provide the heart, and writer-director Kelly Fremon Craig provides one of the season's must-see movies.
3664	6	a	Finally just another schoolmarmish prestige piece touting America's moral superiority
3665	5	a	More deadly than silent.
3666	4	a	It is a nice blend of slapstick fun, a little family pathos and a whole bunch of dogs of all shapes and sizes and is likely to be a popular draw for harassed parents looking for a little respite from the youngsters.
3667	2	a	What makes the movie compelling, despite the subdued dramatic payoff, is that it is a heightened reflection of our experience - our love affair, really - with our gadgets, our apps and, yes, our brands.
3668	5	a	The same. Only worse.
3669	9	a	I was cursed with having to watch this buttock-numbing twaddle, through which you spend most of the time wondering which is worse -- the truly appalling script or the dreadful supporting performances.
3670	0	a	A charming road movie that develops into a full-blown study of life and roots, offering a beautiful insight into the way families migrate and change.
3671	4	a	You're either going to pay to see it twice or wonder what all the fuss is about.
3672	4	a	If the art of the mashup is what passes for originality these days, then Rango is a creative tour de force. 
3673	6	a	Sad, then, to see that the Marvel rag that elevated the human element in the pow-biff-bam of the superhero world has been transposed into the most plastic of comic-to-movie adaptations yet.
3674	4	a	The highlight of the film is all the bouncy Gershwin brother tunes.
3675	3	a	Truly terrifying journey into madness.
3676	6	a	The movie greedily uses its rich cast.
3677	6	a	Ends up having more on its mind than it can successfully handle.
3678	3	a	This bizarre and disturbing drama has all the Almodovar touches.
3679	4	a	A gently sweet film which, without realising its early melancholic promise, aims a little higher than the bear necessities required of a Disney merchandising cash cow.
3680	4	a	To watch Johnny Depp act in anything is always a treat. But does it have to be the only treat going?
3681	7	a	A sadly ordinary bit of fluff, a romantic comedy that aims to be wacky and charming and winds up being neither.
3682	6	a	So much potential left unused...frustrating. I walked out of American Dreamz feeling good, but it was the kind of fluffy good that this movie should have been mocking, not emulating.
3683	4	a	Gough can't disguise his third act monster's rubberiness, but it doesn't fatally wound his clever chiller that impresses up to its inevitably downbeat conclusion.
3684	4	a	Invictus remains inspiring and educational, especially during this present time in America in which we are supposedly muddling our way into a post-racial society.
3685	0	a	A rare, intimate look at Tibetan Buddhists' search for the reincarnation of a deceased Lama, this beautifully filmed documetary is an extraordinary spiritual travelog, with all the dramatic elements of an exotic, enthralling fantasy
3686	1	a	Arguably the best baseball movie ever made.
3687	3	a	Cheerfully catch-all.
3688	1	a	Contemplative, sumptuous and haunting, this is one of the year's best films.
3689	5	a	If you've seen the trailer for this adaptation of Cecelia Ahern's second novel then you probably needn't bother forking out for a ticket as they more or less signpost just how the story pans out.
3690	4	a	Buried beneath this melodrama-but shining through nearly enough to justify a look-one can see the film that could have been. 
3691	6	a	Everything about it was unreal, except it did a big box office.
3692	1	a	You can't go wrong with Knocked Up if you just want to laugh, and feel a bit dirty about it later.
3693	5	a	A bland exploration of a bright concept.
3694	5	a	It's a movie that resists not just the temptations of the day, it resists doing or saying anything even moderately interesting about adolescence, single parenthood or a simpler time.
3695	3	a	Call Me By Your Name survives because of poignant screenwriting, keen directing, and tender acting.
3696	1	a	A tale of tragic misinterpretation, Mystic River requires deep focus into the multiple tortured souls to fully be harnessed.
3697	1	a	Its greatest achievement is to insist that we, the relatively lucky, do what fear and pride seldom allow us to do -- to venture back to life's opening scene, respinning the wheel and replaying the lottery.
3698	6	a	The off-the-cuff slaphappy material feels too stretched out and relentlessly spotty to emphasize any pinpoint intellectual political humor. Slight in its sarcastic overtones...
3699	4	a	Albert Nobbs is more a parable than a person, and Albert Nobbs plays out more closely to a fable than an authentic tale.
3700	6	a	Like discovering a roommate's mangled, half-eaten pie in the fridge; it's not wholly formed, pretty-looking or good for you, yet you still somewhat enjoy it. Ergo, a marginal recommendation for target demo.
3701	4	a	A brave bid to recreate a modern American tragedy, with a revelatory turn by its lead actress.
3702	5	a	For all the expensive honey drizzled over this script, Forster's film is just unpersuasively weird for an hour, before it tails off in the softest of focuses.
3703	6	a	Babe: Pig in the City is mostly a joyless sequel to the joyful original.
3704	3	a	True tale of courage -- and complicity -- at Auschwitz is a harrowing drama that tries to tell of the unspeakable.
3705	3	a	Fine, subtle, moving Ang Lee film.
3706	2	a	A formally daring attempt to capture the rhythms of adolescence wrapped around a murder mystery, Paranoid Park continues Van Sant's fascination with American youth.
3707	6	a	Besides the fact that it's full of near-misses, the movie's charming leads salvage it from being just another predictable romantic drama.
3708	4	a	This chameleon stands out.
3709	4	a	Great production design and very little else.
3710	3	a	The film's strength is its comedic bent - there are some very funny moments contained herein.
3711	3	a	High-art pulp: brazenly kitschy, elegantly creepy, patently ludicrous.
3712	2	a	To the cast's credit, the film is still a lot of fun, even if it's lacking much of the depth that made the original such a hit.
3713	3	a	Funny and scary, this is vintage Polanski.
3714	3	a	"What it all comes down to is that if you in any way, shape or form enjoyed the ""Lord of the Rings"" movies then you must see ""The Hobbit."" Many happy returns."
3715	4	a	...Get On Up is raucous and messy, but it's at least compellingly messy.
3716	8	a	Not a single scene or character rings true, and shame on anyone who can't pick out the murderer in the first reel.
3717	4	a	Nanni Moretti's latest is a mixed bag that too often settles for easy, superficial laughs.
3718	4	a	The Hills Have Eyes meets The Texas Chainsaw Massacre meets Jeepers Creepers. This movie is relentless in its pursuit of scares and squirms.
3719	0	a	A social-realist blockbuster - fired by furious compassion and teeming with sorrow, yet strewn with diamond-shards of beauty, wit and hope.
3720	6	a	Dickie Roberts doesn't fail totally, but Spade is such a lackadaisical comedian that what does end up having any appeal at all always seems to have happened by accident.
3721	4	a	Complex romcom is sweet, if not a home run.
3722	4	a	It's not seamless, but Wilson fans can safely roll out the welcome mat.
3723	6	a	So, okay, men are completely irresponsible slobs, which is why women need to be unceasing nags. Check. Great message for the kids.
3724	2	a	Imaginative special effects and appealing performances.
3725	4	a	Failure to Launch thankfully doesn't live up to its title. Bolstered by some quirky performances, it actually takes off in a surprisingly engaging way.
3726	3	a	Daniel Craig steals the show. 
3727	6	a	Brooke and Gary articulate their discontent with considerable precision and occasional verve. It's that they haven't figured out a way to make emotional torment funny, which is the tall order inherent in anti-romantic comedy.
3728	3	a	A quirky, unique fable featuring the most original character to hit the screen in years.
3729	3	a	It Comes at Night intends to be a cautionary tale about the corrosive, terrible power of fear, but its isolationist bent and thinly disguised xenophobic message also feel creepily and politically prescient.
3730	0	a	An electrifying and enthralling labor of love that acts as a defibrillator for your creative juices.
3731	4	a	I wasn't fully convinced by the lead performance of Australian Jason Clarke. There are moments where his character is so dumb but others where he is so shrewd.
3732	1	a	The spectacular battle scenes, the tenderly poignant love story, and the still-amusing work by Hackman make its broad transgressions quite forgivable.
3733	3	a	Whitaker makes a compelling lead, and the sense of humor here is refreshingly wry and ironic.
3734	4	a	Fun ride from Russell. 
3735	6	a	This one, again, is driven by the tried and tested formula that is cast in stone for all Step Up films.
3736	3	a	If the Ocean's Eleven movies left you with the urge to upgrade your wardrobe, Logan Lucky might inspire a day at the races.
3737	3	a	Campion has created another resonant paean to love's pain and joy, and gives new life to John Keats, too often now associated with dusty school books.
3738	3	a	In his fourth and best film to date, Sean Penn has made an eco-road movie that refreshes and invigorates. Exquisitely shot, robustly acted and deeply felt, it's a potent ode to wanderlust and human pluck.
3739	5	a	Good salesmen would show no pity. The Joneses weeps, and we're not buying it.
3740	4	a	While 'Cosmopolis' is mostly emotionless and a big letdown it isn't completely boring and has the potential to be better with repeat viewings, but it just isn't as good as a Cronenberg film should be.
3741	4	a	Seeing the film ten years later - and in the mighty shadow of Pixar's recent masterpieces - the film feels a little chaotic, safe, tired on its feet.
3742	5	a	Somewhere between Ready Player One and The Emoji Movie, summoning up a zero-gravity spectacle of dazzling colours and vertiginous perspectives, a featureless and inert mashup of memes, brands, avatars and jokes.
3743	4	a	This is never quite as taut as it needs to be, and the Manichean struggle becomes a bit facile.
3744	10	a	This movie is a corpse in desperate need of reanimation.
3745	2	a	Bryan Cranston has become a character actor who can command attention in leading roles, and he shows why here.
3746	9	a	The dead space where laughter should be is like lead.
3747	3	a	A sensual, propulsive thriller, the apocalypse as viewed from lush interiors and a hermetic remove.
3748	8	a	It's wearisome and dull, offering plenty of gore but no brains to back it up.
3749	3	a	Pleasant? No. But the new biographical film Cobb, about baseball great Ty Cobb, is certainly engrossing -- primarily due to a smashing lead performance by Tommy Lee Jones.
3750	6	a	There are only so many ways hapless teens can get brutally slaughtered, after all
3751	1	a	As close as you can get to a family-friendly, live-action satire of Disney animation, made all the better since Disney itself made the film.
3752	9	a	This simply isn't funny enough to charm the parents of the film's intended audience: impressionable and not particularly discerning children.
3753	4	a	Provides scant evidence about why we should care about Grahame to begin with and how her fate was perhaps emblematic of movie sirens both past and present.
3754	3	a	A terrific western with a superb cast
3755	4	a	Flimsy but good wholesome fun.
3756	7	a	An observational character piece that's meant to be experienced in terms of visual beauty, erotic charge and thoughtful contemplation on the intensity and brevity of youth and love.
3757	2	a	Sexual orientation aside, it's the kind of film that can have you looking past family member faults and focusing on what's important.
3758	3	a	Make no mistake, Arctic Tale is a stunning film, full of all the astonishing, even breathtaking nature photography we've come to expect from the folks at National Geographic.
3759	5	a	Dialogue-heavy and too cerebral for its own good -- or, at any rate, too cerebral for its racy subject matter.
3760	4	a	Landmark film that was never all that hot with a solution so jaw-droppingly racist that it's hard to believe.
3761	6	a	Technically it's a very solid movie, but tonally it has problems, which build with each similarly dark and unsettling scene.
3762	0	a	it's the film's stellar cast, along with a gritty narrative and stylized direction, that makes The Cincinnati Kid the best poker movie ever.
3763	6	a	Safety Not Guaranteed is an indie flight of fancy. It's fresh and imaginative. Its best moments are when it is grounded in the absurdity and whimsy of the human condition.
3764	5	a	A simplistic and overly-familiar take on teenage existence, with all the adults portrayed as either clueless or subtly abusive, leaving the world-weary kids to struggle unaided with the harsh realities of life.
3765	5	a	Fine as a series of columns in the Los Angeles Times but a misfit as a movie.
3766	6	a	Early on, [Downey Jr.] remarks that his goal is to understand how and why a person can go from Juilliard to the streets. If only The Soloist had the same intent.
3767	1	a	Uncovers a complex, multilayered tragedy with a surprisingly wide range of victims and perpetrators.
3768	3	a	Somewhat in keeping with its narrative's spectacle of deception, the comedown of this sugar rush of a film might not reveal the most nutritious consumption, but sometimes the messiest concoctions have a better taste.
3769	1	a	The script by writer-director Boaz Yakin is fresh itself, marrying the physical violence of Fresh's world with the intellectual violence of competitive chess.
3770	4	a	The most exciting part of the film is the designer's famous show of sumptuous Moroccan-inspired gowns, bursting with wild color and verve. It's thrilling to watch the collection brought together ...
3771	0	a	Watching Amadeus is like listening to Mozart: it is a horrible beauty beyond words.
3772	1	a	He's [Joss Whedon] interested in relationships, and he makes the smart choice to create drama through character development rather than action.
3773	3	a	Charming tale of songwriter finding her voice has profanity. 
3774	3	a	Displays a succinct sensitivity making it [Sayles'] best film since Lone Star.
3775	5	a	Instead of an out of this world adventure, we're handed a lazy slice of moviemaking.
3776	1	a	Altman, who has made a career of pulling the critics and cineastes his way, demonstrates that artistic sleight of hand once again.
3777	2	a	After Shaun of the Dead and Hot Fuzz, Pegg and Wright conclude their so-called Cornetto Trilogy with yet another riotously inspired exploration of British culture: the pub crawl. 
3778	1	a	The techs are, simply, outstanding in every way.
3779	7	a	Rock the Kasbah is a lazy comedy and outdated political farce that wastes Bill Murray's comedic talents. 
3780	2	a	Even if everything doesn't quite add up at the end, it's OK, since you've just had such a fabulous time being bamboozled by some of the best.
3781	5	a	Fanboys finally arrives in theaters today, although what fanboys will see may be its mangled remains.
3782	1	a	Black Snake Moan IS the blues--a spiritual journey in which love and pain are bound together tighter than a guitar string.
3783	2	a	was mostly shocked by Vince Vaughan, who showed me for the first time that he wasn't the long-delayed immature frat boy he so often plays, but actually an imperfect hilarious, yet often silly, character who's main flaw is his selfishness.
3784	5	a	Utter pap, redeemed only by the professionalism of its stars in sub-standard material.
3785	4	a	The Predator is a bloody, shotgun-paced actioner, loaded with expletives. The film entertains, but feels inordinately lighthearted.
3786	6	a	Armored has a decent second half but the use of obvious metaphors, cliches and amateur film making knocks the film down to a satisfactory rental.
3787	3	a	Ghost Dog: The Way of the Samurai was written and directed by Jim Jarmusch, the perfect and perhaps only filmmaker for this material.
3788	3	a	Takes itself and the horrific situation it puts its characters in seriously...A tense and frightful good time.
3789	3	a	James White will break you, leaving you sobbing your eyes out
3790	9	a	Dialogue focuses only on how characters relate to each other. A game of love, lust, power, manipulation. Nothing more aside from their rather single-minded aims.
3791	4	a	Dusting itself off from a nightmare production, this western finally arrives to shoot, for the most part, straight and true. It certainly ain't no calamity Jane.
3792	4	a	Whilst not as funny as it could have been, Hotel For Dogs gets by on sheer charm, thanks to a likeable cast, a decent script, pacey direction and a high cuteness factor.
3793	3	a	The Soloist brings to life its story with genuine compassion, neatly avoiding many of the traps that afflict Hollywood films about mental illness. And Jamie Foxx's transformation will simply astound.
3794	6	a	An account that one can respect for its refusal to sensationalize, but that saps the tale of much dramatic energy. 
3795	4	a	An effort that is full of gosh-wow moments.
3796	4	a	Still Alice is unquestionably well researched and sincere in its intentions, but at times it feels a little schematic. 
3797	4	a	A great evening's entertainment when you want to switch off and dip your head in some popcorn.
3798	4	a	Crimson Peak would have been a wonderful silent film. 
3799	4	a	[Von Trier] manages to generate big emotions out of meager material, mainly thanks to the performances he gets from his actors.
3800	3	a	Jarmusch has aged into a hipster of a sly, vulnerable vintage.
3801	3	a	Most filmgoers can be mildly amused by the film -- and appreciate Dafoe's eccentric portrayal. But hard-core film buffs will truly sink their teeth into it.
3802	4	a	Attempts to add emotional depth are misguided, but this is an entertaining popcorn flick.
3803	2	a	"While not as engaging as ""The Bourne Identity,"" the sequel fills a void in the undernourished spy movie genre. "
3804	10	a	As usual with Almodovar, there is no one to care for; it's detached, smug, empty camp.
3805	7	a	Diabetics steer clear; so awfully saccharine is the derivative romantic drama Letters to Juliet, it may induce a hyperglycemic coma.
3806	5	a	A characteristically morose wallow in indie-style shoe-gazing that should only please the most dedicated fans of the talented Philip Seymour Hoffman.
3807	3	a	You have to admire any summer blockbuster that freshens and subverts the superhero genre, and you're in fine hands with these actors.
3808	2	a	Indeed, this is where Love, Simon succeeds; in telling a small story about how hard it can be to declare who you are and who you want to be.
3809	6	a	So deficient in the genre's essentials - such as witty dialogue, intriguing characters and surprising yet credible plot turns - that you're embarrassed for everyone involved.
3810	5	a	"As the old man says, with life, sheep poop and 'Step Up' movies, ""sometimes you just have to shovel through it."
3811	6	a	A dull, derivative [film] with no new ideas and a main character who, while clearly simple-minded, is somehow the smartest guy in the story. 
3812	3	a	Writer/director Anahita Ghazvinizadeh gives the film a lyrical, meditative quality.
3813	4	a	Black, more than anyone else, should have been the one to wind up The House with a Clock in Its Walls. Too bad he doesn't give as much as he takes.
3814	4	a	Maggie Carey's feature film debut is full of lazy shots, duff lines and dodgy acting. But it also contains fresh ideas and hilarious gags.
3815	3	a	The bastard father of Three Kings
3816	4	a	A well-mounted... seriocomedy with passing punchlines. And for about half the movie, it's compelling stuff.
3817	2	a	This film is far too long but the central relationship of James and Ford is fascinating.
3818	9	a	For Tom Hanks fans, and everyone else, this is one to miss.
3819	4	a	It's no champion, but it's still a reasonably good cry.
3820	3	a	As captivating as it is earnest and off-beat.
3821	6	a	Disappointingly flat. Hitchcock the man feels best left where he himself enjoyed being most: behind the camera.
3822	5	a	...a yawner plot set-up that leads to lots of wannabe off-colour gags, a small army of pursuing villains and an expected final act in which Jason's icky-sticky niceness might perhaps stop McCarthy from being a shrieking psychopath.
3823	3	a	At its very essence a classically Hollywood, ultra-populist, inspirational underdog sports movie--and a well executed one at that.
3824	5	a	Diane Keaton's frequent bouts of hysteria are numbing in this otherwise amiable shaggy dog story.
3825	4	a	High-Spirited, no-holds barred fun.
3826	6	a	Just because you can do three movies doesn't mean you need to do three movies.
3827	4	a	First off, there's just not enough of the dragons. Secondly, the pace is really slow.
3828	4	a	Mediocre Redford drama set in Cuba of semi-old, directed OK by Pollack.
3829	4	a	Embrace of the Serpent is a breathtakingly gorgeous Oscar-nominated drama that caresses your eyes with its visuals as it bangs you over the head with its message.
3830	3	a	Boy, what a movie.
3831	4	a	The film is obviously low-budget but has a smart script and a real feeling for those who would like to turn back the clock. Its modesty on the whole becomes it, and Plaza is a real find.
3832	2	a	A very strong movie in all the ways you need a horror movie to be strong. But it is a movie that could very obviously be better.
3833	3	a	Woo's signature visual ballistics and predilection for highly wrought melodrama of the kind Douglas Sirk might be proud are imprinted on virtually every frame
3834	6	a	There's a fine line between wit and absurdity, and this particular movie too often falls on the wrong side.
3835	2	a	Kevin Kline tends to give bravura performances even when he's not playing bravura characters.
3836	0	a	A rare masterpiece in both the sci-fi and film noir genres. Blade Runner makes you think, makes you question reality, and makes you return to watch it again and again.
3837	6	a	Have your little ones already seen Ratatouille and rented Thunderpants?
3838	5	a	The movie's musings are disingenuous at best and infuriating at worst, delivered with a hollow solemnity that the flowery story never warrants.
3839	4	a	Charming family movie for tweens and up.
3840	9	a	It's not a movie; it's a cause for dismay.
3841	9	a	Crank: High Voltage, starring Jason Statham as a man with a machine instead of a heart, is boorish, bigoted and borderline pornographic.
3842	6	a	It means to speak to raw, complex emotions, but it looks so ridiculously glossy you can never suspend disbelief.
3843	4	a	"This is a rom-com dressed up as an Oscar-baiting ""dramedy"". It's a good rom-com thanks to it's edge... but occasionally has the bad traits of a bad rom-com."
3844	8	a	The term 'Based on the best selling novel' is starting to become a plague that we can't outrun. 
3845	5	a	More sensational than spiritual, this blood-soaked take on the Stations of the Cross retells the Gospels as a horror movie. You can't help asking: where has all the love gone?
3846	8	a	Has there ever been a time when I wanted the hero to die so badly, as badly as in this film? No.
3847	9	a	Director Justin Chadwick... seems to have suddenly woken up behind the camera, with no idea of how he got there or what kind of film this is.
3848	6	a	While the moviemaking in Miami Vice is impeccable as always, its story finally turns out to be too flimsy a reed to support all of the weight put on it.
3849	6	a	Its characters are thinner than cardboard -- or even comic-book paper.
3850	1	a	Carol is a beautifully shot film that captures the mix of nervousness and excitement that comes with most new relationships.
3851	5	a	As a romantic tale, the movie is bland and predictable and the only reasons to see it are the luminous appearance of Vanessa Redgrave in a supporting role and the picaresque beauty of its setting, Verona.
3852	2	a	Bebop does deliver quite a bit of lively animated action.
3853	4	a	A goretastic, surprisingly funny sequel that plumps for easy CGI thrills and disappointing disability tropes all too often. 
3854	9	a	Bateman and McCarthy thrash around in the dark for laughs that never come.
3855	9	a	The title of the movie could also serve as its review.
3856	6	a	A series of vignettes, mostly unworkable.
3857	0	a	Witty, action-packed superadventure with big themes.
3858	6	a	Just isn't mean spirited enough to give us genuine small town comedy.
3859	5	a	McGregor's character paradoxically gets too much and not enough. Swede feels clogged with sentiment for his daughter, with little room for other emotions.
3860	3	a	"It's highly unlikely you'll read a review of this film that doesn't contain the word ""adorable"". It's equally unlikely that you'll be able to watch it without grinning from ear to ear."
3861	0	a	The epitome of the studio-crafted movie. There's not a lazy, haphazard shot in the entire film.
3862	10	a	The trials and tribulations of a Texas family that nobody would want to spend any time with.
3863	4	a	The umpteenth reboot, remake, rehash, reimagination of the Predator franchise is actually good old fashioned monster movie fun.
3864	3	a	Good coming-of-age movie for older kids.
3865	5	a	Unlike its undercover hero, plays it very safe.
3866	5	a	Perfectly inoffensive and almost entirely unfunny.
3867	5	a	You can tell with every frame that Kasdan's heart is not in this.
3868	4	a	It might just be the weirdest movie of the year.
3869	4	a	The look of So I Married an Axe Murderer is crisply professional, and John Graysmark's production design provides an element of visual surprise.
3870	5	a	Ultimately, this vision of feudal Japan seems to fall somewhere between a graphic novel and computer game. But even comics and games are less witless and tedious than this.
3871	9	a	Nothing works: not the haphazard stabs at conjuring a sweet-and-sour comic tone, not the reliance on people saying horribly inappropriate things in lieu of actual jokes, and not the one-note characters ...
3872	4	a	It is a bold and even poignant idea and the movie certainly zips along. It's not in the Wall-E league, but it's well made and inventive.
3873	9	a	It's hard to believe Pixar's founder would have signed off on this project. The film is as overcomplicated, bloated and crash-prone as a bad-old-days Microsoft release.
3874	6	a	A serviceable adventure outing.
3875	3	a	Much like the subject himself, Jarmusch's film is decidedly not smooth and mellow, but it has the kick of a mule.
3876	1	a	"Less a standard biography than a dramatic character study in the shape of a mosaic puzzle, ""Saint Laurent"" paints a touching and riveting retrospective of legendary fashion designer Yves Saint Laurent's life and work."
3877	5	a	It's a sexed-up, dumbed-down Dr. T and the Women, with penguins to pacify women who've been railroaded into going to this movie by their loutish boyfriends.
3878	3	a	American Dreamz is the rare case of a movie that gets better as it goes along.
3879	3	a	One of the slowest and most deliberately minimalist science fiction films ever made.
3880	0	a	Fascinating tale by the Coen brothers, among their best, with standout work by leads Turturro and Goodman.
3881	6	a	A weirdly off-plumb little movie, one that manages to be condescending and compassionate, knowing and blinkered, reassuring and unsettling all at the same time.
3882	3	a	[McFarlane] is trying to push boundaries that most politically correct comedies and comedians stampeded away from years ago. For me, that is how the West is truly won.
3883	6	a	The movie reeks of the kind of atmosphere that makes you reach for the Lysol.
3884	4	a	Twohy's script dares and succeeds in peppering the dialogue with funny insider references to Hollywood scripts and actors.
3885	4	a	Writer-director Derrick Borte makes an impressive film debut that takes advantage of a familiarity with marketing consumer goods and seductive advertising.
3886	3	a	Enjoyable, well made animated adventure with likeable characters, a strong script and some decent set-pieces as well as a nice line in satire and some quietly subversive gags.
3887	4	a	Dan Mazer's film about a couple who got married too quickly is both funny and plausible, if slightly constricted by its romcom template.
3888	3	a	Mendes has made a troubling film that wrestles with big themes and touchy subjects, even if it is set in an overly familiar milieu.
3889	4	a	The magnitude of the acting overshadows the modest reach of the material.
3890	3	a	Though I usually take pleasure in Almodovar's sexy darkness, this film induces queasiness.
3891	4	a	To enjoy the narrative remixing, you have to cut through an awful lot of postproduction hooey.
3892	3	a	Schindler's List is one of Steven Spielberg's most powerful films, capturing the tragedy and horror while still finding room to inspire and move generations.
3893	4	a	As a piece of filmmaking craft, it's competent, if unremarkable...if Love, Simon helps even one gay teen come to terms with their sexuality, in the friendly confines of familiar movie formulas, hey, it was probably worth it.
3894	9	a	Jet Li and DMX duke it out with an assortment of thugs as if they were slowly making their way to the final stage of Super Mario Bros.
3895	3	a	This sleek and sunny comedy is an all-too-rare example of smart and inventive Hollywood filmmaking.
3896	4	a	There aren't nearly enough preposterous thrillers that involve gorgeous young stars wearing very little clothing.
3897	3	a	"Enchanted earns its label as a ""family film"" by virtue of its ability to captivate audience members both young and old."
3898	6	a	The actors have the showmanship to chew the lurid, shopworn material up to bits, savoring it like a Royale with cheese.
3899	2	a	Beineix's villagescapes and countryside vistas are hard to resist, and the dichotomy of a stone cold looney prancing around them only makes the tableau more curiously complete
3900	6	a	A smooth but frustrating third feature with an extremely good ensemble cast.
3901	4	a	Universal's latest is merely adequate, and will likely be best enjoyed by the happily indulgent and mildly inebriated.
3902	3	a	An impressively directed, superbly edited and utterly riveting tale with an endlessly fascinating collection of twists and turns and some intriguing points to make about both animal and human behaviour.
3903	3	a	Transports us to a world that is like yet unlike our own, and, in its mysterious familiarity, is eerie, intense, and compelling.
3904	0	a	Most audiences will look at the film and see only the simple plot of a fugitive and his two pursuers, but is there more being said and more being asked within the wide open spaces of No Country for Old Men? Indisputably.
3905	5	a	It's a trifle.
3906	4	a	What work better in the movie are mostly smaller moments: the jokes that land, the rapport between the reporters, and all the weirdly ordinary ways people manage to find a new normal, even in the most WTF circumstances.
3907	4	a	Here's a real gem and total justification for the existence of the B-movie.
3908	2	a	I'm not sure if I enjoyed myself, exactly, but I could hardly wait to see what I'd be appalled by next.
3909	6	a	"On the surface, ""Couples Retreat"" appears to be a quickly stitched together comedy that places a bunch of likable actors in a tropical setting for some cheap laughs. And that's exactly what it is."
3910	4	a	mike myers' only tolerable picture
3911	3	a	Cumberbatch creates a memorable character who is at once fascinating and off-putting.
3912	1	a	Woody Allen's time-travelling comedy Midnight In Paris is a valentine to Paris and an absolute delight.
3913	9	a	The movie is Dawn of the Dead crossed with John Carpenter's Ghosts of Mars, with zombies not as ghoulish as the first and trains not as big as the second.
3914	9	a	Most of the jokes fall in one of two creepy categories -- slapstick having to do with the baby's superhuman strength or slapstick involving the baby's sex drive.
3915	6	a	This movie is two hours of Jones acting badly and Wuhl looking drawn.
3916	4	a	For a documentary about a music festival, Soul Power doesn't include nearly enough music.
3917	1	a	American Graffiti is a music-infused tone poem - a fond, delicate trip back to an era often forgotten.
3918	5	a	The half-jokey, half-serious dynamic that works so well in The Big Short - where laughs get caught in your throat - fails to find its groove here. 
3919	3	a	Allen's best, or at any rate by a considerable margin his most pleasurable, since at least Sweet and Lowdown.
3920	3	a	An overwrought score pushes the film into the territory of melodrama, but mostly it works, with tender performances from the two leads.
3921	6	a	This uneven serio-comedy about the impact of parenthood on identities, lifestyles and frienships is too much like a TV sitcom, only occasionally witty and timely in illuminating the way we live now.
3922	6	a	Remember why Kathy Bates won an Oscar? Well this is something like that. 
3923	6	a	Darling Companion is barely half as charming as it imagines itself to be.
3924	3	a	It's good, gory fun, even if its satiric jabs at societal mores come across as more heavy-handed than in the past.
3925	5	a	...silly, repetitive, episodic, mannered...
3926	7	a	Snake Eyes is a technical tour de force, sadly lacking in one important element - surprise and tension.
3927	4	a	While it avoids being preachy, it fails to stir the heart, which renders it a gorgeous, but relatively stultifying exercise in style.
3928	4	a	Bad history perhaps, but Neeson's performance borders on the brilliant.
3929	10	a	You could probably make a good movie out of Good Luck Chuck's pitch; that just didn't happen here. And I like a good, funny, smutty comedy; the problem is that Good Luck Chuck is a bad, unfunny smutty comedy.
3930	3	a	While The Ring is not horror-flick greatness, it's a good shot of gothic creepiness with enough unsettling scares that will keep you awake at night.
3931	0	a	Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri is Martin McDonagh's most scorching work to date; it's immensely entertaining, engaging, savagely brutal, stingingly written with social relevancy, and layered gracefully with musings on anger
3932	6	a	For diehard action fans the explosions and car chases will be enough but for those looking for strong characters and plot development it will be lacking.
3933	2	a	Suspenseful, yes - but it's all too far-fetched to matter much.
3934	1	a	Like the best of Alfred Hitchcock, it's easy to imagine the movie casting its sinister spell on audiences for years to come.
3935	3	a	Diabolically amusing without plunging into the Mel Brooks zone.
3936	5	a	A lackluster and slow-going film where its stories don't pan out well.
3937	3	a	Well worth seeing, if only as a visual treat.
3938	6	a	Much like its main character, the raunchy romp The To Do List tries too hard to find too much enjoyment for too long.
3939	3	a	Without losing its comic rhythm for a moment, it is also a withering spoof of black victimism and the corrupting effect of racial solidarity on the American legal system.
3940	2	a	This sequel keeps the laughs coming until the ending.
3941	7	a	"Improvisational film which was made as a companion piece to the far-superior ""Smoke"". This movie has some good parts to it, but is too disjointed to hold your attention."
3942	5	a	Unsexy and not particularly good-looking.
3943	0	a	Amazing, amusing action-adventure.
3944	0	a	A worthy successor to the smash original.
3945	4	a	Morten Tyldum ties it all together with such steadfast dedication to fine-ness that makes it very difficult to be cross with his film.
3946	5	a	We are treated to the requisite picturesque longshots and dewy close-ups, and yet the thing never connects. Instead of reaching for a tissue, I was checking my watch.
3947	9	a	These insects look less like flies than desiccated Smurfs.
3948	0	a	One of the better Tracy-Hepburn screen pairings.
3949	4	a	A warm, Sunday-afternoon-in-the-park type of movie, if that's your thing.
3950	6	a	For the rest of us, let me suggest we do what I suggested earlier, and that's return home, turn on our computer and boot up the game. We'll certainly have more fun than those paying full price to see this will.
3951	3	a	The movie ought to be scarier, but in the current genre environment of teen-centric, found-footage shockers, its messing-with-Mother Nature traditionalism and structured storytelling is so old-school it feels new again.
3952	6	a	A solid B movie with old-school comedy reminiscent of Mel Brooks. Parker and Cage give standard play. It's James Caan that gives the film its spark. He's marvelous.
3953	9	a	There is nothing good about this Luck.
3954	7	a	There are literally no creative decision-makers of color who helped bring Ready Player One into being. And it shows.
3955	0	a	One of the best WWII films ever made.
3956	2	a	A subtle, slow-moving drama of moments and repercussions that works due to the talents of its cast and quality of its source material despite a few notable flaws. 
3957	2	a	Newcomers intoxicated by Hong's amorous pileups and power plays will hopefully treat the movie as the gateway to an incredible back catalog.
3958	3	a	It may be off its trolley but it also feels fresh out of the packet.
3959	1	a	This mesmerizing documentary makes clear what a talented performer and vibrant presence Shakur was.
3960	0	a	Broken Embraces is a voluptuary of a film, drunk on primary colors, caressing Penelope Cruz, using the devices of a Hitchcock to distract us with surfaces while the sinister uncoils beneath.
3961	3	a	Every moment of First Reformed feels perfectly framed and precisely lit.
3962	2	a	Has a beauty, a frothiness and a wink-wink sense of humor that's enlivening.
3963	0	a	Repeat viewings will allow one to piece together the fragmented montage as a melancholic ode to freedom, and those who fight for it through art.
3964	3	a	Must Love Dogs reminds me of the golden retriever that lived next door long ago: endearing, consistently sweet-natured, ready for a brisk turn around familiar territory as long as no strenuous intellectual demands are ever made.
3965	4	a	Visually inventive and enjoyably quirky...
3966	3	a	Haynes brilliantly captures each of those small moments of both grace and indignity.
3967	9	a	Billy Lynn just looks cheap.
3968	6	a	"A Royal Night Out"" is a featherweight trifle."
3969	4	a	It's a really safe bet that Damon will be Bourne again.
3970	4	a	Ridley Scott's Gladiator is an interesting and attractive action movie, but not a very forceful one.
3971	3	a	[Graves and Mackintosh] put in gobsmackingly good performances.
3972	3	a	As a coming-of-age story it remains touching. As a showcase for Katharine Hepburn, it is superb.
3973	5	a	A rare, but pronounced disappointment from director Ang Lee.
3974	3	a	An evocative portrait of an artistic temperament in defiance of propriety and of how, when such things are repressed, passion and personality are revealed in acts of private ritual and public performance.
3975	4	a	But for all its hit-and-miss jokes, there are lots of ways to die laughing at this Western raunchfest.
3976	2	a	The film jolts the laughs from the audience--as if by cattle prod.
3977	3	a	The two leads are utterly superb, but it's Chalamet who delivers a damned flawless performance as the virginal and inquisitive Elio - as expressive as he is captivating.
3978	8	a	"The Perfect Score"" flunks its way right off the screen and right into the juvenile halls of film gone bad."
3979	4	a	Omar Epps, sporting a great physique and aggressive acting chops, opens up the ring bringing heart and drama to an intro that hadn't much more to offer than big names.
3980	4	a	May be pure hokum, but at least it knows how to spin a yarn.
3981	4	a	Seyfried is a real beauty and her star is definitely on the rise after adding this definitive chick flick to her resume. Redgrave is still a classy dame and steals every scene that she appears in...
3982	5	a	The last name Blart may be the funniest thing in the movie, so that's a hint as to just how bad this shopping-center saga can be.
3983	2	a	A crowd-pleaser of the most old-fashioned sort, and who cares about calculation when it's served up with so abundant a desire to please and blessed with a cast like this one?
3984	3	a	Powerful Australian war-classic with a bevy of great performances
3985	0	a	The story may be sci-fi, but the product is a horror film, plain and simple: a brilliantly constructed scaring machine.
3986	9	a	The movie is of the sort that relies exclusively on charm and charisma. Love the Hard Way has neither.
3987	2	a	The film focuses on the one thing it does differently... and it can't be denied that it does make the tired formula feel ever so slightly fresh for having done so.
3988	3	a	Jennifer Lawrence is the only aspect of the film that truly lives up to the trumped-up awards buzz and hype, but being a perfectly enjoyable light comedy with heaps of heart is no small feat in itself.
3989	5	a	If there were a shootout in the Hollywood comedic corral between...Blazing Saddles, and the new kid in town, A Million Ways to Die in the West, it's not even a contest. Brooks' classic would chase the upstart out of town with a backside full of lead. 
3990	4	a	By glossing over much of the Italian designer's past, Tyrnauer assumes a certain level of familiarity with his subject from his intended audience. If you can't tell Valentino from Versace, you ain't it. That said, The Last Emperor isn't totally ina
3991	0	a	Beautifully shot, superbly acted and thoroughly engaging, this is quite simply Gus Van Sant's masterpiece.
3992	2	a	These action heroes take their fun seriously without taking themselves seriously. 
3993	4	a	While most of the physical comedy is lazy and predictable...what surrounds it is a surprisingly charming diversion with a rather clever premise.
3994	2	a	Set up as a new series. This is the usual, predators predictably predatiting or whatever you call it. Dull characters, too, but the flick is fun if it's your thing.
3995	3	a	It's hard to imagine anyone not being utterly enthralled by the timeless charms and dazzling animation prowess of The Incredibles.
3996	0	a	This is an outstanding movie, with much for families to talk about.
3997	4	a	A sensational, swaggering performance by Chadwick Boseman keeps the funk alive and lifts Get On Up from the tired biopic formula.
3998	4	a	Despite suffering greatly from being far too expositional, still manages to somehow get under your skin and is likely to stay with you long after the credits have rolled.
3999	4	a	Sadly the animation fails to bee-dazzle - often looking a bit flat. Overall, it has to be a Bee-plus.
4000	3	a	A romantic comedy for people who don't like what Hollywood has been calling 'romantic comedies' these days. 
4001	4	a	Dinosaurs rule movie but flimsy screenplay undercuts intense action.
4002	0	a	It is a heartbreaking story of betrayed trust, broken faith and the misuse of privilege.
4003	4	a	Impressionistic, DIY sci-fi suffers from a lack of cohesion but is a finely crafted debut from a gifted director.
4004	2	a	The Chamber of Secrets may not be a classic, but it's more eventful than its predecessor.
4005	4	a	Had the picture been written half as well as it was drawn, I suspect it would have proven at the very least twice as super.
4006	6	a	The movie is elegantly shot, but based on what's on screen, it's hard to tell what motivated Mary Harron to direct this emotionally vapid feature
4007	5	a	"Reduces global terrorism to a Rubik's Cube suitable for an evening's entertainment. If that doesn't make you vaguely ill, by all means take this thriller for the shallow, gimmicky ""ride"" it aspires to be."
4008	3	a	Whiskey Tango Foxtrot? It's Delta Whiskey Charlie; definitely worth catching.
4009	2	a	Carried a surprising distance by writer/director Borte before it falls completely apart, but what works here works wonderfully, providing a painfully accurate depiction of materialism run amok. 
4010	10	a	'Sucken.'
4011	9	a	The biggest problem is that Yi's quest for love, and understanding of such, simply isn't all that interesting.
4012	4	a	The movie snakes along with an earthy hiss, thanks to music, Jackson and Ricci's painful availability.
4013	4	a	This is surprisingly fun, with loveable characters.
4014	9	a	How do you mess up this story so spectacularly?
4015	4	a	Creates a rapport with its young viewers by first affronting them with its crude treatment of sex and then entertaining them with a silly plot.
4016	3	a	One of the most satisfying action movies in a long, long time.
4017	0	a	Suburbia never was what it's cracked up to be.
4018	0	a	Oyewolo brilliantly conveys [King's] incandescent gifts ... his shrewd tactical intelligence, blazing moral conviction and spellbinding rhetorical power.
4019	4	a	[Tina] Fey delivers a performance that's complex and restrained, and it's easily her best work in a feature film to date. 
4020	6	a	Typical light summer fare.
4021	2	a	My Big Fat Greek Wedding is that rare animal known as 'a perfect family film,' because it's about family.
4022	3	a	Based on a true story, the cops-and-crime drama The Infiltrator is a straightforward police procedural that's enlivened by a solid central performance by Bryan Cranston.
4023	4	a	As long as you can deal with romantic leads who are rather flawed and a more cynical tone than you may expect, you should find plenty to laugh about, offset with the odd grimace.
4024	0	a	It has the perfect blend of action, humor, and suspense. And Harrison Ford defined the action hero for the new decade.
4025	5	a	Treasure Island may be a much-loved story, but you would never know it from viewing the uninspired castration that is Treasure Planet.
4026	5	a	Stinkers this rapturously self-assured don't come along often, and when they do, they deserve to be honored with the proper giggling disbelief.
4027	0	a	What's so special about Three Billboards is that it has genuine, sincere empathy for its characters, across the board 
4028	6	a	Veering from witty to occasionally trite, Wristcutters: A Love Story has plenty of originality on its side, but never manages to be more than the sum of its self-consciously quirky parts.
4029	4	a	It probably won't be nominated for awards, but surely it will become a classic among teens. [Full Review in Spanish]
4030	4	a	Ancient history never looked so good.
4031	5	a	A barely disguised rehash of Straw Dogs.
4032	4	a	If you come seeking theological subtlety, let alone such modern inventions as psychological depth, you'll walk away battered and empty-handed.
4033	8	a	I did not know I could yawn angrily. This movie somehow proved it possible.
4034	4	a	Bolt isn't a dazzler, but it's entertainment with heart.
4035	2	a	A very elegantly crafted piece of gothic snuff hokum.
4036	5	a	The music is the movie's best feature, but even that's not much...
4037	4	a	Chicken Run contains some gorgeous, destined-to-be-classic set pieces, and this is where the Aardman production team flex their animation muscles.
4038	2	a	This Gothic Hitchcock-Poe mash-up is a feast for the eyes.
4039	9	a	It is so lacking in flesh-and-blood characters, so unclear in its depiction of battles like Bull Run, and so nauseating in its gruesome sentimentality that it is all but unwatchable.
4040	1	a	This movie isn't just smart, it's also wise.
4041	10	a	It's amazing that so many viewers were still seated by the time the end credits began to roll.
4042	3	a	A seamless debut feature for Derrick Borte as writer, director and producer.
4043	3	a	The Curious Case of Benjamin Button does what technically masterful films so rarely do, inspiring a tremendous sense of warmth as well as admiration.
4044	4	a	The Hand That Rocks the Cradle keeps you watching, yet this oddly somber thriller is really just a transparent chain of contrivances; it's all stunts, all concept.
4045	2	a	Kudos to Brooks for crafting Lisa as the kind of smart, level-headed, capable, red-blooded, confident female protagonist we almost never get to see in the movies.
4046	4	a	Wildly colorful and playfully weird ... better-than-average family fare.
4047	3	a	As ever, le Carre subverts the spy genre in a major way.
4048	9	a	A movie that makes you leave the theatre with thoughts of having yourself, and your neighbors, spayed is not a good thing.
4049	3	a	an existentialist parable wrapped up in a darkly humorous teen fantasy and suburban satire
4050	6	a	It's too ... six years ago.
4051	5	a	Over the course of the film, many funny, gory and silly -- but not particularly horrifying -- events occur.
4052	2	a	Easily this summer's most welcome big-budget surprise, a studio film that isn't afraid to ask its audience to think.
4053	7	a	Watching Couples Retreat cowriters Favreau and Vince Vaughn play schlubby husbands is like showing up to your high school reunion to find that the once-sharply dressed cool guys with the fake IDs are now fat and bald. And married.
4054	4	a	Like its predecessor, it's as exuberant as it is puerile, oozing a cheeky energy that will make you forgive many things.
4055	1	a	A major part of the film's success, however, lies in Oyelowo's masterful portrayal.
4056	6	a	The movie plays out like a over-budget student film that lacks any of the competence and patience of an experienced director.
4057	3	a	There isn't a classic scene that we will remember for many years, but it is still a visual delight. [Full review in Spanish]
4058	1	a	A minor flaw or two but assuming you don't spend all of your days barefoot like a Hobbit, the movie will knock your socks off. 
4059	3	a	This is a strange, agonized film--a darkly comic end-of-the-millennium fable with unforgettable performances and visuals. The writing is tight, smart and edgy; there's no question it hits a chord with our consumer-crazed lifestyle.
4060	5	a	Tense but shallow military drama heavy on violence, language
4061	9	a	Even Helen Mirren on a bad day is better than nine out of ten American film queens polluting movie screens on any given Sunday, but really, this is one time she should have stayed in bed.
4062	10	a	The film is made by women, which just goes to show female moviemakers are equally capable of insulting female audiences.
4063	5	a	It's a movie that's half-over before it tells us what it's really about.
4064	6	a	The acting is good in this film, but watching it is like a depressing, exhausting journey to nowhere.
4065	3	a	Just Write is enjoyably forgettable, with exceptionally charismatic actors and an appealing storyline.
4066	6	a	A good idea and good acting are ruined by a craven Hollywood Ending.
4067	5	a	Jurassic Park III is a depressingly soulless, utterly unnecessary sequel.
4068	4	a	A super-suave but softer Bond, with Craig barely wrinkling his gorgeous suits. Bardem, as a dandyish villain, works up a good, greasy sweat.
4069	1	a	Even if the new Bourne Identity doesn't stick to the letter of his work, the late, great Ludlum would still appreciate this ripping yarn if he saw it.
4070	4	a	There's little potential for surprise or much creativity within this old formula.
4071	2	a	...provides a healthy dose of dark satiric drama, psychological gamesmanship, good performances, and valuable themes.
4072	4	a	If it's sometimes a little too pat, a little too cute, bear in mind that this film's target audience is the post-Barney, pre-Bratz set and not John James Audubon.
4073	5	a	It's neither funny nor feelgood, but its biggest crime is wasting Murray, left trying to mine laughs from unfunny circumstances.
4074	9	a	"There are all kinds of bad movies in the world, but it's really only stardom that can create the exact variety of cinematic abortion we find in ""The Tourist."
4075	8	a	The film suggests the denial of the common worker, whose service to industry is only as worthy as his social status.
4076	6	a	Nine of the shorts are instantly forgettable, two are wryly amusing and one is a knockout.
4077	5	a	Your usual over-the-top blockbuster disaster of a formulaic disaster movie.
4078	3	a	It's a companion piece more than a traditional sequel; an examination of what can happen when you choose life but can't escape your past.
4079	3	a	Already a hilarious filmmaker, Judd Apatow is maturing into an emotionally resonant storyteller.
4080	4	a	Some of the bits are funny, every now and then they're sweet, the performances are OK and really, with this much talent involved, it's hard not to be disappointed in that.
4081	6	a	I got antsy in the bee movie.
4082	6	a	Simply too much unpleasantness afoot.
4083	3	a	Amusing, melancholy, and meditative, Ghost Dog is a modern classic of the hit man genre.
4084	3	a	"Matt Damon's Jason Bourne brings new meaning to the word ""spy."" A fine example of a sequel to surpass the original."
4085	4	a	While Waist Deep offers precious little that hasn't been seen before, its energy, wit, effective lead performances and taut direction save this old-fashioned B-movie...
4086	3	a	A largely successful attempt to present the life story of the impenetrable and eccentric genius of funk in a way that respects Brown's memory and experiments with the biopic formula while also entertaining a mainstream audience.
4087	5	a	The real shame about Psycho is that there are glimmers of the very smart satire that could've been.
4088	5	a	True story of drugs and sex is for adults only.
4089	1	a	A fascinating and engrossing character study.
4090	2	a	The worthwhile attempts at creating realistic character dynamics and situations within a very specific era in New York is notable for sure.
4091	2	a	Skyfall proves that a long-standing series can deliver the expected fundamentals while keeping the new films fresh and unpredictable.
4092	5	a	This looked to be a priority project by Warner Bros. at one point -- that is until cash spigot got turned off. The special effects are really cheesy, even by comic-book standards.
4093	4	a	The attempt to stay true to a historically minded adventure by maintaining a strangely subdued tone in terms of action just doesn't work.
4094	0	a	Silver Linings Playbook is all things to all moviegoers. Please join the queues circling the blocks.
4095	2	a	All in all, this is an impressive debut, the complete absence of lava and ash clouds notwithstanding.
4096	3	a	The superb cast does a wonderful job of keeping us guessing as to everyone's motives.
4097	3	a	The Logan family may have had a curse on them, but this winning outing from returning director Steven Soderbergh has lifted it; Logan Lucky is one madcap heist flick that ranks up there with the best of them.
4098	3	a	An evocative journey, lean and pitiless and occasionally gut-wrenching.
4099	1	a	With Nurse Betty, Zellweger moves fully into the realm of leading lady. Her crooked mouth and mousey voice notwithstanding, I wouldn't think it would be out of the question for her to garner an Oscar nomination for this excellent performance...
4100	5	a	Ewan McGregor's inert adaption smooths out the Philip Roth novel's eruptions of self-loathing and doubt. 
4101	3	a	Very effective thriller. More scary than sexy.
4102	3	a	The movie... is so engaging there are times when it becomes almost overwhelming. But that is a glowing sign of how well the movie is acted and put together.
4103	6	a	"Oh, for the time when men were men and were encouraged to beat the tar out of one another. That's the world ""Fight Club"" pines for."
4104	1	a	Spielberg's sci-fic adventure, his most commercially successful film to date, is defined by never before seen special and visual effects.
4105	4	a	Just as admirable are the film's unsparing depiction of the hardships caused by terrain and temperature, its palpable sense of physicality and a lack of sentimentality compared to most of Hollywood's similarly inspirational profiles in courage.
4106	3	a	cool but not as cool
4107	3	a	Sometimes we need sweetness, like when we've just eaten a ration of bitter Neil LaBute or Ridley Scott movies.
4108	0	a	All the way around, Pleasantville is a must-see movie.
4109	9	a	Puerile and self-indulgent without a real laugh to be found. I have no idea how this gets released by a major studio, while Ralph Bakshi has to go to Kickstarter for a Vimeo release. Just say no. 
4110	5	a	Strained comedy and action do not a good film make, even with Segal and Hawn starring.
4111	6	a	Young people are likely to find this more appropriate and bewitching than do their elders. The latter are likely to feel less gleeful in the presence of heroes who rob and steal.
4112	4	a	Weird to the Gilliamth degree, Munchausen just might making being an 'uneven' movie a compliment.
4113	5	a	Great effects, a dime's worth of headache-inducing story.
4114	3	a	... a movie about a sentient zombie, trapped in a womblike limousine while outside the dead souls of Manhattan roil, spraying paint on his windows and hurling rats. Everything he wants is posthumous.
4115	6	a	"There is a crafty, creepy, provocative film lurking inside of ""The Lazarus Effect,"" but, alas, it never comes out to play."
4116	4	a	Things are pushed over the top rather successfully, but breaking momentum is a pretty big mistake for movie that wants to wow us with ruthless efficiency.
4117	3	a	The powerful, emotional music perfectly complements the dark, somber tone of the film.
4118	5	a	Gross and sadistic but never scary.
4119	5	a	Light and amusing but shallow and diffuse, Ang Lee's take on the seminal music event is one of his weakest works, due to Schamus' poor literary adaptation, which is full of stereotypes and devoid of gravitas.
4120	4	a	...it's not tense enough, realistic enough, or exciting enough to lift it much beyond the ordinary.
4121	4	a	Matthew McConaughey takes the movie up a notch with his fabulously over-the-top performance
4122	9	a	Perfectly solid visual effects show up onscreen constantly enough to remind us of the wasted effort turned in by the FX crews.
4123	8	a	A simple and subtle, yet outrageous and intricate, comedy with the kind of inconsequential embellishments that make all Altman's best films ring so true.
4124	6	a	Perhaps it goes without saying that Total Recall is no The Terminator, but let the records show.
4125	6	a	... feels like Barnyard swipes too much of its plot from The Lion King.
4126	0	a	An astonishing story, told with grace
4127	3	a	Irresistibly salacious soap opera, teeming with lust, scheming, backstabbing, and some outrageously overheated plot twists.
4128	4	a	The more abstract and overtly stylized Cosmopolis is, the more it thrills.
4129	6	a	While this has a few laugh-out-loud moments, overall, this is an adequate farewell performance that too often falls flat and feels off-key.
4130	6	a	The Perfect Score is not very academic...doesn't make the grade as convincingly as it should have in its showcase of mischievous adolescence.
4131	5	a	Startling at times, but just as equally distant at others, Cube seems to have it all backwards: It's a film in search of a one-act play.
4132	4	a	Given the nature of this narrative, and the fact the majority of the tale takes place through the eyes, and ears, of an undercover officer, what transpires is a film that constantly has you looking over the protagonist's shoulders.
4133	4	a	With each entry, the films become more removed from their source. Freddy just isn't scary anymore.
4134	4	a	Everybody looks like they're having fun in Little Man, another inane outing from the Wayans brothers. And with some ineptly made comedies, that's good enough.
4135	3	a	Profane, violent, and scabrously funny, this Team has something to offend all, from pious Hollywood liberals to knee-jerk nationalists.
4136	5	a	Payne can't seem to decide if he's coddling these old-school Midwesterners for their rudely rustic values or sneering at the sheer narrowness of their worldview.
4137	1	a	Packed with adventure, humor and straight-forward drama, Lions is the type of movie I loved as a kid and clearly I haven't outgrown the formula.
4138	1	a	"The Silver Linings Playbook"" defies categorization: it's both comedy and drama, without fitting neatly into either genre."
4139	0	a	Everything is perfect in Vertigo.
4140	3	a	Lock, Stock is fun, in a slapdash way; it has an exuberance, and in a time when movies follow formulas like zombies, it's alive.
4141	5	a	Here's a tale so old, archaeologists should carbon date the script. 
4142	2	a	A bright, charming romance.
4143	2	a	"...a charming bon-bon, a bookend to his ""Purple Rose of Cairo."" But it is also a refreshing take to hear the septuagenarian filmmaker who has shown a predilection for embracing the past push an alter ego so firmly into the future."
4144	6	a	As a biopic, anti-Apartheid chronicle, the film is mediocre, but the young Denzel Washington is excellent, rendering an Oscar-nominated performance.
4145	4	a	There's a lot to recommend Becoming Jane, particularly the performances. Hathaway does more than survive. If she doesn't seem like a literary genius, she at least seems like a worthy Austen heroine -- intelligent, independent and brave.
4146	4	a	This would be one heavy slog without its luminous leads.
4147	1	a	You will want to be there, pulling for Brady, no matter what choices he makes. More importantly, you will care about those choices, and about him.
4148	0	a	Respect to Clint for putting his cojones on the line to make a 'chick flick,' and utmost respect to him for pulling it off with aplomb.
4149	9	a	When a chick flick goes wrong -- and this one hits a dead end in hell -- it's a wipeout.
4150	0	a	A unique dramedy that stands heads and shoulders above most romantic films.
4151	0	a	It captures uncapturable feelings on film.
4152	5	a	Writer-director Jane Campion approaches the tale with an artiste's respectful solemnity, but it too often comes off like Twilight transplanted across oceans and centuries.
4153	5	a	It's content to stay at the level of puerile humor.
4154	4	a	"Between this and last year's overlooked ""Faster,"" it's great to see The Rock re-embracing the action genre, and when his clobbering match with Diesel finally happens, it's as outlandishly room-wrecking as I'd hoped."
4155	5	a	Sadly, the surprisingly podgy Seagal spends far too much time contemplating and not enough time kicking Russian butt.
4156	9	a	It's a relief when Paltrow's character bursts into song. That's the only time when she's not pitching fits to beat the band ... making the band, and the audience, extremely grateful.
4157	5	a	Striking visuals and some good George Harrison songs can't save it.
4158	1	a	Director James Marsh smartly, slyly suggests through cinematic style that Project Nim was far from an authentic scientific experiment.
4159	6	a	Amusing in small doses, marketed to kids and not really FOR kids. An undeserving Oscar winner.
4160	9	a	Takes itself so seriously that you'd think you were watching a production of King Lear -- except King Lear is positively action-packed by comparison. 
4161	3	a	Nim's story is so fascinating and telling... that it would probably be impossible for even the very worst of filmmakers to screw it up, and Marsh is not the worst of filmmakers.
4162	10	a	during the shark attack . . . the sympathy was not necessarily with the humans in the water
4163	4	a	Ultimately, the comedy here is grounded in self-hatred, hostility, and despair.
4164	4	a	While Hrebejk's biblical references and baby making slapstick become somewhat labored, his gentle comedy nonetheless stands true to his title.
4165	1	a	Sometimes the star outshines the screenplay.
4166	4	a	What [Guillermo] del Toro had in mind when shooting Crimson Peak was probably a stylish gothic period piece in the same acclaimed lane as Pan's Labyrinth. Unfortunately, Crimson Peak fails to work on that level. 
4167	3	a	Well, it's just so doggone cute.
4168	2	a	It's just too refreshing to see a well-made, genuinely funny comedy that is actually about something meaningful.
4169	4	a	"Larry Crowne"" is an adult story about starting over and finding love. Inspiring the audience to never give up, whether it is for an education or finding that one true love. "
4170	6	a	Seems too slight and shallow to really work as a drama.
4171	5	a	The movie reminded me of a beer commercial during a football game, with about as much depth but not nearly the wit.
4172	4	a	The characters' behaviour rings true, the tension is strong and the oily darkness of it all looks good. Within his vaguely realistic constraints, however, Shults doesn't find a way to nudge the story to a satisfying ending.
4173	4	a	It's great that Taking Woodstock doesn't trample on anything sacred, but it also never arrives anywhere interesting.
4174	4	a	It's a fine idea that could have made for a devastating critique of consumerism had Borte chosen to follow it through to a cynical, nihilistic conclusion.
4175	4	a	Great animation, third-rate plot, but it still appeals to the geek within.
4176	5	a	"Goodbye Lover"" is a gum-chewing mess. And that's WAY before Ellen DeGeneres shows up."
4177	6	a	"A family-friendly, Hallmark Channel-ready musical dramatic fable whose plot more closely resembles Spike Lee's ""Red Hook Summer.''"
4178	3	a	What a joy to see an original vision constructed with so much passion and smarts.
4179	3	a	Bandslam consistently exceeds current teen-flick standards thanks to its snarky humour, its strong musical sequences and its ability to convey the excitement the characters feel both about performing and forming new friendships.
4180	2	a	"[Cage is] the reason to see ""Matchstick Men,"" a good film kept from greatness by a script...that tips its hand too early."
4181	4	a	In her American feature debut, a romantic advenure in the Greek Islands, the tall and sexy Sophia Loren starred with the short and declining Alan Ladd.
4182	3	a	A fascinating story and film about the down-under in us all.
4183	6	a	When he's firing on all cylinders, Wilson plays the trickster catalyst, the knowing knave with charming lassitude. Now if only his accidental sage can find a fable worth his goofball wisdom.
4184	7	a	The action sequences are okay, but there are so many plot holes that the whole thing is ruined from the end of the bridge sequence.
4185	3	a	Hollywood satire is not usually this enjoyable: Both savage and silly, Pleasantville is an absolute blast.
4186	9	a	For nearly two hours, Padilha bombards viewers with senseless, sickening violence for its own sake.
4187	9	a	Hornet lacks sting.
4188	5	a	If imitation is the sincerest form of flattery, then Gary Fleder's Don't Say a Word is one of the most complimentary films to hit the screens in years.
4189	9	a	As fun as it is to revisit one of Arnold Schwarzenegger's better films, this update never quite clicks despite trying to rebottle the vibe from the original.
4190	6	a	This sentimental, lightweight biopic is more concerned with the childish passive-aggressiveness of Hitchcock's marriage than the inner-workings of his artistic mind.
4191	5	a	Throw in a supporting cast of TV escapees from the likes of Prison Break and CSI, and Darkest Minds feels like a wannabe movie franchise that already knew it was on borrowed time.
4192	3	a	Anthony Mann's terrific final western is a potent examination of one man's battle against his own darker impulses.
4193	9	a	An awful excuse for cinema that ultimately fails in nearly every way possible.
4194	4	a	Competent, watchable remake that improves on the special effects and running time but loses the moral complexity and the character work of the original.
4195	7	a	Should come with a warning: may cause optic nerve damage as a result of excessive eye-rolling
4196	6	a	The notion of deleting emotion from people, even in an advanced Prozac Nation, is so insanely dysfunctional that the rampantly designed Equilibrium becomes a concept doofus.
4197	1	a	This movie blew me away.
4198	3	a	As with most romantic comedies, Failure to Launch takes off thanks to its upbeat tone and the charisma of its stars.
4199	2	a	...the darkly beautiful work of an autistic, damaged child.
4200	5	a	Never once transcends expectations, instead perpetuating our initial apprehensions related to the project.
4201	9	a	Contains the humor, characterization, poignancy, and intelligence of a bad sitcom.
4202	5	a	The snow might be tricky to predict. But the bad winter movies arrive right on schedule
4203	5	a	Feels antiquated - like a Bob Hope comedy from the forties.
4204	0	a	This is one of those films that are absolutely perfect and timeless.
4205	7	a	A punch-drunk combination of pugilistic hokum and feminist empowerment fantasy.
4206	5	a	Director Bill Duke can't avoid the stereotypes... or the sermonizing of the lesson.
4207	4	a	A skillfully composed but gloomy affair that rigidly positions itself as a Serious Adult Drama of the feel-bad variety.
4208	2	a	Almost every moment of War of the Worlds is heart-racing, jaw-dropping, knuckle-biting, date-grabbing adrenaline.
4209	4	a	Davis elevates the material beyond the soap-opera conventions ... barely.
4210	3	a	A film that's alive with ideas - funny, refreshing, compassionate.
4211	4	a	It's a more believable scenario for infidelity than most such movies, and Aniston gives her all to the role.
4212	4	a	Just as entertaining and as visually attractive as the five previous Bond films.
4213	7	a	It's a trivial pursuit, slathered with peanut butter.
4214	4	a	The film becomes more bewitching the more it loses direction. Yi stops questioning strangers and starts questioning herself. She also interrogates the ability, or inability, of cinema to follow love into its deepest mazes.
4215	8	a	About as subtle as an amplified death rattle--only not quite as fun to listen to.
4216	2	a	I kept wanting Shults' film to add up to a little more in the end. Still, his chops behind the camera are undeniable. I can't wait to see what he does next.
4217	4	a	An engaging, if familiar, mix of teen rites of passage, the fun of friendship and mooning over a cool girl. Still, Nat Wolff and Cara Delevingne make for a watchable duo.
4218	4	a	While [Still Alice] is bleak and incredibly serious, it mostly avoids cheap sentimentality, managing to educate without becoming an after-school special.
4219	5	a	More sexual innuendo than usual in provocatively named film.
4220	3	a	An undeniably moving film to experience, and ultimately that's what makes it worth a recommendation.
4221	3	a	Warm, funny, smart. The best rom-com in a long time.
4222	5	a	Bland TV expose loosely based on the life of Jessica Savitch
4223	4	a	The story is touching, the dialogue clever, the cast is great and the period detail is impressive.
4224	6	a	Must Love Dogs isn't quite a dog, but it's far from an ideal date movie.
4225	2	a	While it isn't clear if another version of The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo is necessary, Fincher couldn't make it boring with all this lurid material... But in any language with anyone at the helm, Lisbeth is still a killer.
4226	6	a	The movie is cold, miscalculated and hollow, and aside from a few isolated scenes of genuine excitement, it's also rather dreary.
4227	4	a	Dickie Roberts: Former Child Star is alert fun as long as it stays on Hollywood and Vine ... once Dickie is transplanted to suburbia, his movie becomes just another bland, heartfelt family-oriented comedy.
4228	9	a	About as funny as watching a cute animal die a long slow death - and probably as painful.
4229	9	a	Have you been waiting for Helen Mirren to run the best little whorehouse in Reno?
4230	6	a	"I wish I could write that he is ""without limits"" as a director, but it is Towne's flair for the obvious that prevents this picture from going that extra mile."
4231	1	a	Its retro-retro take uniquely delivers the most crucial element of the moviegoing experience, the art of entertainment.
4232	10	a	Do anything. Arrange an appointment in Sumatra. Go to the moon. At all costs stay away.
4233	1	a	Have no fear, you legions of Potter fans: Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets is a solid step forward in the movie adaptations of J.K. Rowling's much-read novels.
4234	3	a	If the concept of a contemporary, postmodern silent film sounds like a gimmick, it is, but Hazanavicius' attention to character makes certain that the film acts as more.
4235	5	a	This road trip is not worth leaving home for.
4236	5	a	Like a stuffed crust pizza, the film gets cheesier the further into it you get.
4237	8	a	Mr. Palminteri's primary duties include glowering at henchmen Bruno and Roscoe, saying 'get me that diamond' a few times and, ultimately, taking a toy airplane to the crotch.
4238	5	a	If Betty Blue teaches us anything -- and there's a good chance it doesn't -- it's that life is full of little mysteries.
4239	5	a	Something is missing
4240	3	a	The Artist, as calculated as you know it is, is simply impossible to resist.
4241	3	a	The effort to raise a child, Menashe reminds us, is as likely to confront us with our own childishness as it is to bring out our maturity and responsibility.
4242	5	a	Manor trickles along unconvincingly without once dispatching any genuine sense of supreme sadistic surprises. For this revelation alone, Cold Creek Manor certainly needs to be condemned.
4243	6	a	"Gallo's self-consciously overstated direction feeds the impression that he's trying to remake Goodfellas...can we all agree by now that the use of ""Sympathy for the Devil"" in crime pictures ought to be outlawed?"
4244	5	a	A starchy, flavorless pudding.
4245	3	a	"Rango"" has everything going for it -- strong characters, complex plotting, and a knowledge of the genre it parodies without excluding newcomers to it. It's smart without being alienating and exciting without being mindless. "
4246	2	a	The film's sensitive treatment of the domestic issues at the center of the story goes far to make up for the more problematic passages.
4247	8	a	It seems to unfold in some implausible twilight zone of Crayola ethics.
4248	3	a	It's heavy-handed in places but the writers could be forgiven given this is a family film targeted at people of all ages.
4249	2	a	While a handful of scenes approach John Waters levels of obscurity, you're going to need to get properly stoned to roll with a version of feminism that empowers girls to bro out.
4250	3	a	"Yep, that's ""The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo."
4251	1	a	A whip-smart, fingernail-chewing creation that crackles with tension and is pocked with thrilling incarnations of evil. It makes the standard-issue nightmare seem like a tropical vacation.
4252	3	a	Three Billboards Outside of Ebbing, Missouri is an incredibly solid film. The strength of the talented ensemble will take the movie far. 
4253	2	a	Morgan Freeman's performance as Nelson Mandela in Invictus is, like Clint Eastwood's film as a whole, constructed of deliberate decisions and never feels false.
4254	6	a	They make it all up, and it's still boring.
4255	4	a	Here is a smart, entertaining satire on greed and materialism among America's leisured classes.
4256	2	a	Paradoxically, even when pulling its emotional punches 'Still Alice' can't entirely escape the limitations of the disease-of-the-week genre, but largely as a result of Moore's extraordinary skill it largely transcends them.
4257	6	a	Strangely watchable , but ultimately less than satisfying.
4258	5	a	The best of the comic book movies in recent years have demonstrated that thrills and spectacle don't have to be strangers to wit and grace.
4259	5	a	... wallows in the weepy glitz of country music ... without once tapping into its true grit.
4260	9	a	It's actually rare for me to see a film that is such an utter failure on so many levels.
4261	0	a	These Potter kids have grown up a lot in one year. At this rate, their next adventure will be Harry Potter and the Octogenarian's Enlarged Prostate.
4262	0	a	A poignant period piece which serves as a telling reminder of how far we've come from the days when homosexuality was still considered a crime of moral turpitude
4263	6	a	This couples-in-conflict comedy starts strongly but then slips into the turquoise water of paradise lost.
4264	10	a	A hellish, horrible experience wasting the talents of all involved.
4265	0	a	Frances McDormand is superb, giving an Oscar type of uncompromising performance in a film that is Fargo good.
4266	2	a	In a season of cartoons and superhero movies, Larry Crowne is the equivalent of a comfortable pair of slippers. 
4267	4	a	Instead of melting into the holes of the story like so much warm butter, the audience gets scraped across Anderson's room-temperature toast. There's no chemical reaction, which has the effect of leaving the audience cold.
4268	4	a	Though the film sags a little in places, it imparts its be-true-to-yourself life lessons with sweetness and charm...
4269	8	a	Laughably explores science and faith. 
4270	7	a	"Were it not for the recent ""Arrival"" of one Scarlett Johansson, The Perfect Score would still be holding down a shelf in the Paramount Pictures - Do Not Release office."
4271	0	a	If the marionette-on-marionette action doesn't have you rolling in the aisles, the razor sharp movie spoofs will.
4272	3	a	A fun, insightful and sensuous romp through a world in which few of us have traveled.
4273	4	a	Works terrifically well up to a point.
4274	5	a	A wishy-washy thriller with political leanings that never quite fit.
4275	5	a	Writers Mark Schwahn and John Gatins have a teen-movie pedigree, and they've kludged the film's true-life material into a conventional three-act shape instead of reimagining it as cinematic.
4276	0	a	Ozu only has to train his camera on a face to uncover a sense of resignation, or longing, or loneliness, and the mood, if you allow it, becomes quite overwhelming.
4277	6	a	"After setting up the professional and emotional devastation Jason Bateman's character suffers when his identity is stolen, the movie does its best to say, ""You know what? Forget about that. Laugh at the crazy car crashes instead."
4278	5	a	Almost fantastically bad.
4279	4	a	The first entry in the Predator franchise in almost a decade is a solid action romp that's even kind of ... goofy?
4280	3	a	I Don't Know does it with charm.
4281	3	a	...a surprisingly engaging and involving little thriller.
4282	3	a	Serenity pulls off more honestly thrilling action with a fraction of Lucas' average budget.
4283	4	a	It's not the definitive biography diehards might be longing for, but it is an enjoyable lark that weaves fact and fiction, with a dash of old-Hollywood nostalgia thrown in.
4284	2	a	The film is jolted into hopes and dreams and more importantly, escaping a blah life. But you can just sense there is something else. After all, this film isn't called 'Frank and April Move to Paris.'
4285	4	a	A pity that this film gets dragged by its convoluted plot, forcing emotion without deepening in any of its great subjects. Not even in love. [Full review in Spanish]
4286	9	a	Never funny, never meaningful, never coherent, never animated.
4287	1	a	Like the computer animators at Pixar, the stop-motion wizards at Aardman realize their technical prowess would be wasted without a worthy script.
4288	3	a	The film gets both funnier and scarier by the minute.
4289	9	a	Flight of the Phoenix ignores the human drama to focus on cockamamie setbacks that are harder to swallow than the plane's motor oil.
4290	4	a	a political satire that wants to be little more than a warm'n'fuzzy comedy
4291	6	a	If Breathed's style could have been applied to the animation, this offbeat story would have a better chance at success. Instead, we're left with a kids' movie that leaves audiences cold.
4292	1	a	As Valentino's team of seamstresses pore over a sequined white dress, entirely hand-sewn, and finally premiere it to the designer in its flawless, couture glory, it's all you can do not to gasp with pleasure.
4293	3	a	A mostly absorbing tale of the hunter being subverted into the hunted, No Country For Old Men deserves to be lauded for its gripping, relentless thrills rather than its flawed denouement.
4294	4	a	It overcomes the adversity of cliche by being exciting and mildly intelligent, with a sufficient amount of humour and heart.
4295	0	a	It resonates most thanks to the performances that bring it to life.
4296	5	a	There is not a single memorable joke or line of dialogue in it, something that even the dumbest of comedies usually delivers.
4297	3	a	an inspiring film, no matter what your faith. 
4298	5	a	It's probably unfair to pine for the movie a director didn't make, but it's disappointing that Nanni Moretti's Vatican dramedy We Have A Pope has so little to do with the actual selection process for a new pontiff.
4299	2	a	This is [Allen's] most satisfying film in decades, a film with wit and ideas that is primarily about romanticism, illusion, and nostalgia.
4300	0	a	The aquatic terror is deftly balanced with lively, likeable characterisations.
4301	4	a	When presented with the script, Boyle et al should just have said no.
4302	6	a	I'll bet the video game is a lot more fun than the film.
4303	0	a	Daring to broach the subject of how dated the characters and the series are, Daniel Craig, Judi Dench and director Sam Mendes make one of the best Bond's of all. 
4304	10	a	When the big revelations come at the end, they certainly rate an eleven on a Prepostero-Meter with a scale of ten.
4305	2	a	It's clever and cute and never lets you forget it, winning in spite of how much it insists on it.
4306	3	a	If for nothing else, deserves to be fondly remembered for bringing the Stay Puft Marshmallow Man into the world.
4307	2	a	This film moves along energetically only because Cranston does. When the director and the lousy screenplay interfere things look very ordinary.
4308	4	a	[There's] quite a bit of heart, as you would expect from the directors of The Little Mermaid and Aladdin.
4309	5	a	As a police procedural, it's a generally dull affair. As an exercise in silliness, it elicits a fair few laughs. But whether the joke's on Herzog or on us is anybody's guess.
4310	3	a	Many critics have found in Mann's films an excess of macho bluster. I can only say his power and exuberant self-belief expose the indentikit dullness of a hundred other meagre film-makers working with similar material.
4311	3	a	Nick Robinson crafts an immensely likeable Simon - as appealing as any of the teenage protagonists in a John Hughes comedy.
4312	5	a	An average romantic comedy, starring Will Smith and Eva Mendes, that is as soft and sweet as a marshmallow, and about as interesting.
4313	3	a	Sleeping With the Enemy teeters constantly on the verge of silliness but director Joseph Ruben keeps the cornball melodrama scaled down to a pleasant lull.
4314	1	a	"A fun lightweight adventure, one of the better Cary Grant films, and a darned good ""starter"" romantic comedy because of all the other distractions and a world that threatens to tear this couple apart before they can even come together."
4315	9	a	[It] takes advantage of yet another anniversary celebration of the three-day music festival, but Lee only uses the milestone for surface draw. Otherwise, this aimless, pointless, emotionless and self-aggrandizing debacle would have no reason to exist.
4316	9	a	Director Jimmy Hayward fails to establish a viable reason for this movie to exist.
4317	3	a	The music really is amazing, and so I do recommend this one.
4318	4	a	There's something to strike a chord with most audiences.
4319	2	a	Omar Sharif gives one of his very best performances in this touching adaptation of playwright Eric-Emmanuel Schmitt's autobiographical novel, Monsieur Ibrahim and the Flowers of the Koran.
4320	1	a	In fact, we think we know Mildred as a classic American movie type - a deeply wronged person on a relentless quest for justice. Because she is righteous, and because she is Frances McDormand, we are reflexively with her in this.
4321	1	a	A life lived in backward progression leaves a feeling of melancholy in this accomplished realization of a novel concept.
4322	5	a	The heavy-handed score by notoriously heavy-handed James Horner is often the only indication that there's supposed to be a point to this showcase for Gooding's relentlessly adorable mugging.
4323	1	a	You'll see it because you love Bill Murray. But somewhere about halfway through you'll realize that you're watching something much more than a dramatic vehicle for Hollywood's clown prince.
4324	2	a	This is as good a chase thriller as you could want.
4325	4	a	I could sympathize with Damon's character suffering from memory loss, as I too couldn't recall much about this forgettable film soon after seeing it.
4326	1	a	an effectively calculated tearjerker
4327	1	a	Amid the controversy and accusations of excessive violence that surrounds Mel Gibson's The Passion of the Christ lies a good movie.
4328	3	a	Delivers a sugar rush without the calories.
4329	4	a	If you liked one, you'll like the other
4330	7	a	Westfeldt has a tendency to go over the top, and Friends With Kids in particular has a shrill, smug edge that kills the comedy and the drama alike.
4331	6	a	You might chuckle occasionally as the film drones on to a close, but mostly you'll be wondering when it will all end.
4332	6	a	When the most terrifying aspect of your horror film is the soundtrack and the most fully sympathetic character is the family dog, perhaps its time to re-examine your work.
4333	6	a	There's a terrific idea at the heart of Pleasantville, and it's a shame that its creator, Big screenwriter Gary Ross, can't figure where to take it.
4334	6	a	Never comes close to captivating its audience like the game did before it.
4335	4	a	Featherweight romantic comedy has a few nice twists in a standard plot ... and the charisma of Hugh Grant and Sandra Bullock.
4336	2	a	American Dreamz tries hard to be both important and farcical, but it leans a bit too much towards farce without being funny enough to pull that off either. It's decent, but uninspired.
4337	3	a	The story of Jack Skellington, the Pumpkin King... is like Jack himself -- spindly and thin, but with a resounding voice.
4338	0	a	This film is sure to make all but the hardest-hearted shed tears.
4339	2	a	Little details, as well as Whitaker's performance ... elevate this film.
4340	2	a	The acting is good, plot holes many and concession stand just down the hall.
4341	3	a	Girls Trip never feels like it is judging its characters, even at their most outlandish. Instead it repeatedly sends a message that being yourself and living your truth are the way to find happiness. 
4342	5	a	The film, like most of MacFarlane's work, is a mix of occasional laugh-out-loud moments - there are some here - and cringe-worthy misfires that play a lot more tone-deaf than he seems to intend.
4343	4	a	The movie works, maybe because of all the easily digestible lessons of racial tolerance and sports movie cliches.
4344	4	a	Fans of the genre will find much to enjoy in this knowingly silly exercise in day-glo splatter.
4345	8	a	Despite James L. Brooks' sterling track record and a strong cast, this flat, fumbling film is dud on arrival.
4346	8	a	Welcome--now get out.
4347	1	a	Spielberg treats us as he does his characters, leading us into a strange land and expecting us to make it out with all our faculties intact; it's a tall order, given the heart-stopping, bloodcurdling, limbs-numbing excitement packed into the second hour.
4348	8	a	The real suspense is whether we will ever get to the end of this movie.
4349	6	a	Strictly for small fry.
4350	4	a	Flatly retells a high-concept Boy's Life adventure story that's hard to break, but easy to bleed of its significance.
4351	8	a	Flight of the Phoenix is a rare breed. It joins the small group of films in which the audience may actually wish that the characters do not achieve their goal: to live.
4352	1	a	Bill Murray and Scarlett Johansson give performances that will be talked about for years.
4353	1	a	Captivating, suspenseful and thought-provoking.
4354	7	a	A yawn in the park.
4355	3	a	It's an awkward, unapologetic, unconventional -- and ultimately winning -- look at first love, one that unabashedly portrays the complications and confusion that result from those first crushes and rushes of attraction and passion.
4356	9	a	Blissfully unaware of it own comfy worldview.
4357	0	a	A moving and achingly beautiful feast for the soul.
4358	7	a	It sews together disparate story concepts from three or four different genres and tries to bring it to life. Yet like the Frankenstein monster, it is an abomination.
4359	3	a	In the tradition of teen classics like Clueless, Mean Girls, and Juno comes The Edge of Seventeen, a brilliant coming-of-age comedy with anger issues.
4360	3	a	[It] is better than the average entry in the subgenre because it eschews exposition in favor of thrills.
4361	3	a	The story is affecting, the action scenes are thrilling, the issues are resonant. 
4362	3	a	What is evident by the film's conclusion is that our sincere and honest relationships with fellow men and women is what makes us human and great; not at all our connection to nature
4363	2	a	A mellow, pictorially attractive period piece in which the characters seem actually to breathe rather than merely pose, as so often happens in such films.
4364	4	a	A big-screen outing for the small screen Nancy Drew-alike that puts the 'fun' into 'crowdfunding'.
4365	5	a	Tommy Boy unspools just as you expect it to, and the comedy is as unrewarding as the story
4366	5	a	More like Dorothy wandering lost through the great land of Oz, only without the heart of A.I., the brains of Minority Report or the courage of Blade Runner.
4367	0	a	In attaching sinuous style and casual sexiness to a universal ache, [Luca] Guadagnino has come away with real wisdom. Sweet and salty, his movie burns like a suntan.
4368	1	a	Cumberbatch's performance is riveting, but Knightley deserves credit for doing it backwards and in heels, so to speak. In fact, Clarke probably deserves her own biopic as one of the few female practitioners of the code-breaking art.
4369	6	a	The superficial Eat Pray Love wants to chronicle a person's rejuvenation through revelatory life experience, but it feels like tapas for the soul.
4370	2	a	If it flukes a wide release and finds an audience it could mark the beginnings of a sensibility revolution in American humor.
4371	6	a	It's too bad this film wasn't effective enough to present that message of indomitability in a stronger, more engaging way, because kids need it now more than ever.
4372	9	a	It takes less than four minutes to realise that this Underworld-style, graphic novel adaptation won't keep anyone in the audience sitting bolt upright for long.
4373	6	a	This movie is about drawing things out as much as possible to make a snack-size story feel like a meal.
4374	1	a	Frenetic portrait of Rome's elite recalls La Dolce Vita and Ulysses
4375	3	a	Who doesn't love seeing an underdog succeed, especially one this kind hearted and fun. A welcome surprise.
4376	6	a	If you looked up the word 'fluff' in the dictionary, you shouldn't be surprised if it shows a poster for this romantic comedy...
4377	7	a	Falls into the easy traps of traditional melodrama.
4378	5	a	A big, bloated disaster of a movie you could almost call the Heaven's Gate of its generation.
4379	8	a	Beyond its basic concept, Bee Movie hasn't the first idea where to go.
4380	2	a	Low-key charmer saved by star power
4381	4	a	Animated comedy is old-fashioned and fun; some peril. 
4382	2	a	Verbinski does manage to set up and deliver a decent array of spooky, eerie and yes, scary scenes and imagery.
4383	4	a	The Fockers is a must-have for family viewing. 
4384	3	a	Not only is the film funny, sometimes side-splittingly so, but it's also very well made, with unexpected moments of real tension and tenderness in and amongst the comedy.
4385	6	a	Cold Creek Manor is neither as funny as it should be nor is it as mysterious as its initial self-reflexivity would have you believe.
4386	1	a	Fight Club combines a physical rush with an intelligent script and features wonderful performances of sharply-defined characters.
4387	6	a	Cold Creek Manor is one of those cases of the trailer making it look a whole lot scarier than it actually is.
4388	4	a	Dorff's Stu is always a bit too low-key, even when he's doing his painting, so as a dramatic character he never becomes all that interesting.
4389	6	a	The movie doesn't leave an endearing impression of romance.
4390	1	a	Del Toro has successfully managed to take the most desirable elements of his previous Spanish-language work like The Devil's Backbone and Pan's Labyrinth and expand on them with a bigger budget and a Hollywood cast.
4391	1	a	On its face, this is your basic redemption-through-sports story. What makes it special is Eastwood's ability to artfully and concisely tell a story, and Morgan Freeman's wonderfully understated turn as South African President Nelson Mandela.
4392	1	a	Moorhouse's willingness to push the envelope and dive into the darkest aspects of the tale with such macabre relish allows the emotions swirling within this maelstrom to resonate all the deeper.
4393	4	a	Still still hums with humanity in the person of Moore, whose towering performance shows a staggering technical proficiency while never losing a whit of emotional resonance.
4394	0	a	The suspense is killer. Hitchcock would be sick with jealousy.
4395	4	a	The emotions are as beautifully captured as the scenery, but the staging is wutheringly contrived.
4396	2	a	Seems ... deeply and painfully authentic.
4397	4	a	Impressively directed and beautifully shot, this is a compelling, superbly acted drama that exerts a powerful emotional grip, though it's impossible not to suspect that certain liberties have been taken with the actual events.
4398	0	a	As much a poignant meditation on motherhood lost as a searing indictment of the Catholic Church's antiquated attitude about what might be in the best interests of an adopted child.
4399	3	a	Shamir is smart enough to move his film beyond shrill polemics and into more observational territory: Israeli high-school kids visiting Poland to see the death camps, African-Americans on a street corner in Brooklyn discussing their experiences with Jews.
4400	8	a	The attempts to extract comedy from this grim raw material are leaden, blood-soaked disasters.
4401	2	a	We will race cars, we will crash cars, and at some point, a large-breasted woman in a low-cut blouse will lean over an engine block.
4402	0	a	A beguiling story of two people from different worlds who come together powerfully.
4403	2	a	You seem, at times, to actually be part of the picture, as characters appear to stand right next to you, or as plankton drifts lazily before your eyes when you're submerged.
4404	5	a	"Somewhat silly and more than somewhat tasteless, ""American Dreamz"" isn't as smart as it thinkw it is."
4405	2	a	Pretty darn-good B-western.
4406	2	a	With so many ideas in play, the film is never dull. Sometimes it's also funny, perceptive and nuanced. Things get deeper and dirtier as it rolls on, but not really clearer, in terms of purpose.
4407	8	a	More depressing than unfunny.
4408	6	a	. The door is left open for another sequel. I have an idea for it: a movie studio is about to greenlight yet another subpar teen slasher pic, but the fisherman comes in and hooks everyone before production can start. Sound good?
4409	3	a	Ixcanul is a moving portrait of a clash of cultures we North Americans may never experience firsthand. 
4410	3	a	It could have been shortened a bit, I didn't think the material was enough for almost two hours, but if you enjoy dramedy's like SIDEWAYS, give it a try.
4411	0	a	It all begins with the title. The irony aside, its lightness and alliteration suggest the last breaths of one of the film's victims.
4412	6	a	Tina Fey is fine as real-life Afghanistan and Pakistan reporter Kim Baker. The rest of the movie is not so fine.
4413	1	a	A good-spirited comedy.
4414	2	a	American Hustle contains fireworks aplenty-dramatic outbursts of bravura filmmaking, sly acting choices, a scene that makes Robert De Niro scary again-but also a few too many familiar moments.
4415	9	a	Evelyn sports the sort of diminishing returns cheered by idiots.
4416	4	a	It's the sort of obvious chamber melodrama the script, with its eccentric characters, works so hard to avoid.
4417	8	a	The clanky screenplay is downright dopey.
4418	3	a	Larsson himself would probably have loved this classier interpretation of his rather pulpy narrative.
4419	3	a	Staggering in its efficiency, admirable in its insistence that the women deserve as much screen time as the men, and awe-inspiring as a vehicle of romantic and even career reassurance for moviegoers...
4420	0	a	Often remembered as sentimental holiday-themed 'Capra-corn'... but in fact leavened by darker themes and a more rigorous moral about self-sacrifice.
4421	3	a	Quite simply, Woo is to action what Fred Astaire was to dance and John Wayne was to winning the West. Nobody does it better.
4422	9	a	A lazy, juvenile, starkly unfunny and consistently unrelatable family film.
4423	5	a	...Hanks' and Vardalos' treatment of a middle-aged Joe heading back to the classroom is about as believable as Rodney Dangerfield's Back to School - and not half as entertaining.
4424	6	a	Redundant and more than a little wearisome.
4425	5	a	[An] agonisingly self-conscious and meagre piece of work.
4426	2	a	Lively and high-spirited.
4427	4	a	Familiar and worn holiday story saved by most excellent music. 
4428	0	a	In this exquisite merging of specific and universal, infinite and infinitesimal, Tokyo Story perhaps most clearly illuminates that Ozu is not the most Japanese of filmmakers, but the most human. 
4429	2	a	Succeeds not only as a straight-forward action picture with suspense and excitement, but also as a touching and funny story about the importance of family and individuality.
4430	4	a	There was the sharp contrast of surface-banter and concentration on detail; of unpredictable laughter, brushed off by disciplined professionalism.
4431	3	a	A straightforward road trip with an embracing sense of melancholia
4432	8	a	An utterly boneheaded movie.
4433	4	a	Cahill is one of the most talented filmmakers to emerge in the last decade. His sophomore feature may disappoint, but it's clear he has much more to say.
4434	2	a	What really works most is the great chemistry between Gordon and Capron. This very talented duo stirred up thoughts of what Steve Martin and John Candy might have been like had they teamed up long ago as twelve-year-old boys.
4435	2	a	Cahill clearly feels the mystery of the life experience, and he wants to explore the spiritual implications of consciousness. But he's too analytical to surrender entirely to abstracts and human fable.
4436	7	a	At two hours and even with the rushed feel it still feels overly long and worst of all -- cheap.
4437	4	a	While we'd like it if the film had managed to be less schematic, had succeeded in fulfilling its sociological aims in more humanistic terms, we're willing to cut it slack because it sometimes seems no one else is even trying.
4438	3	a	"Since soaring on AMC's ""Breaking Bad,"" Cranston simply doesn't make dull movies. He carries his latest through an intense and fact-based saga about the scary business of drug cartels."
4439	3	a	Eminem wipes away his hubris, revealing a trembling, self-doubting kid on the way up.
4440	8	a	Thirteen Days is a tribute to the moment when John F. Kennedy developed a legacy worth remembering, a moment in Washington when wisdom prevailed.
4441	1	a	When the movie concludes, you can talk about these characters as if you actually know them -- which won't be far from the truth.
4442	6	a	The film is designed for the public, but because it's made up of interviews with financial insiders -- and financial insiders talk like experts, not like high school economics teachers -- some of this information may be difficult for lay people to follow.
4443	3	a	A zany satire that will leave you either mesmerised by its brilliance or just a little dazed by it's lunacy.
4444	2	a	The movie almost has enough assured touches and aromatic performances to make you overlook that the humour is generic at times and that the story suffers from not having a genuine antagonist to shake things up.
4445	6	a	One of the most lame comedy whodunnits ever to make it to the screen.
4446	3	a	[Director Joshua] Weinstein, one feels, comes to Borough Park not to judge but to quietly observe.
4447	5	a	It's hardly groundbreaking, and some of the voicework is bland, but it doesn't drag.
4448	6	a	It's not a bad film -- it just could have been a lot better. 
4449	0	a	The best date movie since When Harry Met Sally.
4450	1	a	This Ozon comes much closer to the nasty little prankster that I liked so much with Sitcom.
4451	3	a	Freeman's performance is a fine tribute to Mandela, perfectly capturing his grin, posture and unbreakable upbeatness.
4452	5	a	In the end, despite him playing someone with a missing eye, it's a vanity project for Cruise - a heavyweight historical drama to put him back on the map, but one that only sees him more lost.
4453	4	a	It is ironic that the framing device, which is meant to draw our attention to the constructed nature of it all, doesn't work nearly as well and ultimately fails to derail our enjoyment of that which we're supposed to be questioning. 
4454	6	a	A die-hardly pic that pits President Rambo against Oldman's boilerplate Russian hijacker.
4455	0	a	It's Jones who carries the film's meaning, and does so effortlessly. He -- and the Coens -- have never been better.
4456	4	a	Genuine silliness is so rare a quality these days that it shouldn't go undervalued, even in a sweet little nothing of a picture like Bee Movie.
4457	3	a	A story of violence, and it's superbly told.
4458	2	a	...not a difficult movie to criticize, [but] a hard movie not to like.
4459	4	a	The best thing about The Dressmaker is, of course, Kate Winslet. The plot is over-complicated and includes a wedding, a funeral, an ambitious death count, drugs and alcohol, dueling dressmakers, and a grand finale theatrical extravaganza. 
4460	1	a	There is always something to smile about and identify with. If you're a slacker, condescending or extremely hormonal this film has someone for you to worship.
4461	3	a	I love the way that both Samuel Jackson and Christina Ricci take chances like this, and the way that Brewer creates characters of unbelievable forbearance.
4462	2	a	Pretty tame 'Zoo'
4463	4	a	The rapid dialogue is dry and mannered, like a David Mamet play, there's virtually no story and Cronenberg's visual scheme is cold and claustrophobic.
4464	6	a	The strangely planet-bound James Bond plot unfolds just like you'd suspect, only slower.
4465	4	a	worth a rental
4466	4	a	A better-than-average slasher movie is that it understands exactly the sorts of cheap thrills its audience is looking for and delivers them with a minimum of distraction and a maximum of energy.
4467	6	a	It drags in some critical phases, it labors in obvious spots and the climax is too manufactured. But there are side-splitting moments in it.
4468	2	a	Its atmosphere is spot on, making it a nostalgic treat for many viewers today.
4469	4	a	There's a guilty, infantile fun to Team America.
4470	1	a	Even when the accents are as indecipherable as the plot, Ritchie keeps the action percolating and the humor on high.
4471	2	a	Without a particularly strong storyline and loaded with only modestly enjoyable gags, it putts along like a familiar old jalopy, reasonably likeable if eminently forgettable.
4472	4	a	Even when the movie is not working, it's never less than eye-catching. It's also a perfect setting for Cage's curiously compelling art.
4473	9	a	Jam-packed with literally bruising jokes. Every five minutes or so, someone gets clocked.
4474	3	a	My Neighbor Totoro is more than a fairy tale; it is an engaging story which uses fantasy sparingly.
4475	2	a	Five films in and the Fast and the Furious franchise finally gets itself into gear with the wonderfully over the top Fast Five.
4476	2	a	[Flight Plan] may not win Foster another Oscar, [but] it manages to remind us of how entirely commanding a screen presence she can be.
4477	1	a	An engaging but deliberate chick flick at times, Eat, Pray, Love has the quintessential chick flick star at the helm with Roberts, who played the role beautifully... 
4478	6	a	Not all that exciting to watch, let me tell you.
4479	0	a	No Country for Old Men is a modern American masterpiece, a film of unbridled power and purpose.
4480	9	a	Why is such a talented cast doing such weak material? This finally becomes clear an hour in, when most of the actors get to do what they love: play emotional breakdowns.
4481	3	a	Frances McDormand brings life to a character that expresses... through action rather than dialogue. [Full review in Spanish]
4482	1	a	The Incredibles eventually captures all the right emotional beats, thumping superhero action and poignant moments to make the film, well, almost incredible. 
4483	0	a	It's a beautiful, big, sorrowful film that manages to celebrate America while reexamining what it has stood for and what it has become.
4484	5	a	A slow and plodding would-be thriller.
4485	6	a	It's got Tom Hanks, it's got Julia Roberts, and ... well, that's pretty much it.
4486	4	a	Burton has evoked the surface of Ed Wood's life, but in a story about a man who loves angora and frilly panties, he has barely unbuttoned Wood's uniform.
4487	10	a	Everything lacks inspiration.
4488	4	a	A smartly budgeted and often scary chiller.
4489	9	a	Madonna may have the body, but there's no evidence she can act with it.
4490	1	a	There is great anguish and great artistry in this showcase by Winslet. This is a film that hurts so good.
4491	6	a	Doesn't have either the guts or wherewithal to follow through with the humor and stick to its setup.
4492	1	a	This is a sweet, funny, unapologetically sentimental film.
4493	5	a	Jay and Silent Bob is strictly for hard-core fans of the New Jersey chronicles -- and you know who you are. Like the also weak Mallrats, the new film will survive strictly on the good will of Smith's fans.
4494	9	a	Team Cable Guy has made a junky, throwaway comedy that will almost certainly appeal to his fans, for at least the first half hour. Then it runs out of gas. Or jokes. The gas Larry seems to have in no short supply.
4495	1	a	This film is spectacular in its simplicity. The quiet story is filled with intelligence, wit, anger, sadness, triumph and tragedy.
4496	4	a	CQ is a sort of movie-brat movie, mildly entertaining.
4497	3	a	A heartfelt and loving film that is meant to help you remember to not take life for granted and treasure every moment.
4498	6	a	Awesome photography but possessing more schmaltz than herring shoppers will find at Zabar's on a Sunday shopping spree.
4499	4	a	Action is what this movie does best.
4500	3	a	The House With a Clock in Its Walls has a slick competence and cleverness that will appeal to adults and just enough menace to make the film tense but not terrifying for younger viewers.
4501	6	a	There are some bright moments in the movie but, sadly, Dragon Blade is unfulfilling as a whole.
4502	5	a	Andy Samberg's imitation of Marky Mark as Barky Bark is vastly more amusing than Wahlberg's latest action vehicle.
4503	6	a	It isn't good by any stretch of the imagination, but B-movie lovers who like their dance movies flashy, fun, and spectacularly dumb shouldn't mind.
4504	4	a	shows the limitations of the small-screen form
4505	6	a	It's an equal-opportunity fizzle.
4506	9	a	The Cold Turkey would've been a far better title.
4507	4	a	It makes you want to see more of Hanks and Fisk, but overall it just isn't all that memorable. Worth a rental.
4508	4	a	This oddly toned high-school flick may boast less of the X-Factor but it's all the more interesting for its raggedy edges.
4509	0	a	CALL ME BY YOUR NAME REVIEW: 'A STUNNING COMING-OF-AGE TALE THAT WILL GO DOWN IN GAY CINEMA HISTORY
4510	3	a	Julianne Moore shows us that she is still in her prime, playing to every subtle nuance of the degenerative disease with precision and respect. 
4511	9	a	"The Green Hornet"" is an almost unendurable demonstration of a movie with nothing to be about."
4512	4	a	With his wild, thinning hair and general look of disease, Cage's interpretation of Jack's desperation is a total hoot, bravely unglamorous and consistently agitated. 
4513	0	a	The most intelligent and terrifying vision of the future ever conceived for the screen ...
4514	3	a	A film so unashamedly manly, it makes Fight Club look like the time they did Single Ladies on Glee.
4515	4	a	A sunny and reasonably funny coming-of-ager from Sundance-ratified debutant Jordan Vogt-Roberts.
4516	4	a	The dogs include a fine three-legged fellow who reminded me of my in-law's old dog, Buddy, and that's the sort of movie we have here. You use it to think about dogs you once knew, or the ones whose company you're enjoying at present.
4517	1	a	It's a lot of fun: cute characters and pretty colors for the kids; and lots of punny laughs for dads and moms.
4518	7	a	There's a puzzling incuriousity about Benjamin's affliction, and gauzy scrims of separation between the audience and this fascinating but oblique, unknowable protagonist.
4519	5	a	An interminable costume drama strictly for Tom Cruise fans and for World War II buffs.
4520	3	a	Despite the predictable narrative, it never fails to make you laugh because playing with food is vulgar and messy, but always fun. [Full review in Spanish]
4521	3	a	Cumberbatch's finely calibrated performance helps bring to life one of history's lesser-known stories and most shameful injustices.
4522	8	a	Directed in a paint-by-numbers manner.
4523	5	a	A patchwork collection of derivative gags and relationship drama that seems leftover from old 'thirtysomething' episodes.
4524	4	a	Quirky enough for me to recommend it, but its self-satisfied braininess diminishes what could have been a truly wonderful film.
4525	6	a	Could cause more gender confusion than 'Transamerica.'
4526	0	a	There is no purpose to a suspense thriller, I suppose, except to involve us, scare us, to give us moments of vicarious terror. Play Misty for Me does that with an almost cruel efficiency.
4527	9	a	The lucky people are the ones who decide not to suffer through this drek.
4528	3	a	A worthy sequel that feels like the characters: a little more grown-up, a little more timely and a lot more confident in what it strives to be, which is a damn good comedy.
4529	3	a	Among the summer's 'toons, Monster House remains the most visually exciting and sophisticated, but Barnyard is much funnier.
4530	1	a	Skyfall returns Bond to Solid Ground
4531	3	a	Best...Bond...ever.
4532	7	a	[Vantage Point is] a puzzle cut by a drunken, three-fingered jigsaw operator who lost a few pieces and chewed on a few others.
4533	3	a	Don't think about this loony metaphysical comedy too much. Just go with it and, chances are, you'll get it.
4534	1	a	Weird, difficult, and important, Cosmopolis may be one of the best films of the year.
4535	3	a	The leads have excellent support from Jimmy Smits, Cherry Jones, Shareeka Epps and S. Epatha Merkerson-plus, that most welcome rarity, a subtle turn from Samuel L. Jackson.
4536	4	a	After an hour or so, despite the heroic efforts of cast and crew, torpor and impatience slither between the movie's trapdoors.
4537	4	a	McDormand seems to know how to get the most out of the smoggy material, giving one of her most natural and appealing characterizations.
4538	4	a	"As the closing credits begin to roll, I found myself wanting to say, ""That's nice Florian. Isn't that cute. Now put away your toys and get back to work."
4539	5	a	It's all right when it's trying to be a comedy or a savvy electoral satire. But it takes a disastrous wrong turn into paranoid political thriller territory and never recovers.
4540	4	a	As confections go, this one is pure meringue, sweet and melting. And mostly air.
4541	3	a	Depicts a very specific mental state too shaded and delicate for most movies to feel comfortable approaching it.
4542	2	a	Spike Lee's adaptation of Richard Price's powerful novel about a drug dealer and a cop pursuing him for a crime captures the story's essence, evoking a melancholy world in which the chances of surviving and staying on the straight and narrow are small.
4543	5	a	Caught somewhere between silly and serious, The Darkest Minds is a generic, late entry in the Young Adult sci-fi genre...
4544	5	a	Broadly sticking to the boxing movie blueprint is forgivable, Teller failing to properly sell the struggle of a man whose livelihood and reason for living is almost ripped away from him isn't.
4545	3	a	The movie is a mind-tickler that makes the viewer actively engage with the story and try to penetrate its elegant sleight-of-hand.
4546	2	a	"Despite problems, ""Get on Up"" is a crowd pleaser of a film, whose powerful musical moments can overshadow any smaller issues within the film."
4547	4	a	"The ideas of independence, young love and pushing the boundaries of friendship are so familiar, but in ""The Kings of Summer"" it's as if you're dealing with them for the first time."
4548	4	a	Hall shows taste and humor as a filmmaker, and he is fortunate to have three leads who bring quirkiness and style to his film. 
4549	3	a	It's entertaining and inoffensive, a rare combination in kids' films, which are usually neither.
4550	5	a	A thoroughly prosaic and prototypical spooker that commits the cardinal sin of devaluing what made the raw materials of its fable so original and powerful in the first place.
4551	3	a	What starts out as a Doris Day-Rock Hudson romantic comedy morphs into 'Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf.'
4552	6	a	A tame, glittery spoof without a brain in its head or a character worth caring about.
4553	1	a	Coppola clearly loves these characters, and so we do, too.
4554	8	a	This is a bloated SNL sketch comedy film, complete with Terry Bradshaw nudity and a cast pausing for the audience to laugh.
4555	4	a	Gosh, this is a good-natured movie.
4556	3	a	A masterly tale of the good, the deranged and the doomed that inflects the raw violence of the west with a wry acknowledgement of the demise of codes of honour, this is frighteningly intelligent and imaginative.
4557	5	a	The ponderous title, unfortunately, is appropriate to a film that is not only lethargic and unexciting but will be a muddle to anyone who doesn't bring a pretty good knowledge of the Watergate affair to the theatre with him.
4558	3	a	Redgrave brings a lovely gravity to the lightweight proceedings, while Seyfried again proves an unusually levelheaded presence.
4559	4	a	Here is a film that feels incomplete, as if its last step is into thin air. Scene by scene you feel its skill, but you leave the theater wondering about the meaning of it all.
4560	6	a	Flightplan maintains emotional altitude until it starts hitting the turbulence of unbelievable coincidence.
4561	4	a	Sure, it's a bit of a mess, but it's an entertaining mess, and even if it does fly off a cliff towards the end I still can't exactly complain about being burned.
4562	0	a	Mesmerizing mature drama with just a bit of sex, violence.
4563	0	a	A joyous cinematic valentine to the silent movie era, The Artist is the most out-and-out entertaining, purely enjoyable movie to come around in years. 
4564	6	a	Flawed by the use of Chinese actors taking the roles of Japanese and for its use of English all around.
4565	0	a	A crazy beaut of a comedy that brims with generosity and manages to circumvent predictability at every turn.
4566	0	a	Although the Muppets pile on the wit and child-friendly slapstick, they never dumb down, and never compromise their story's literary origins.
4567	4	a	A colourful romp with a smattering of subtext.
4568	3	a	A gently meta fairy tale that pokes fun at Disney's animated classics, just never too hard to hurt.
4569	6	a	It goes on too long and is trapped by too many cliches.
4570	4	a	It may be most effective for audiences who do need a spoonful of sugar to make the historical medicine go down.
4571	3	a	If not a full blown triumph, this is certainly one of the best Bonds in recent memory.
4572	0	a	Enchanted is easily the best Disney movie in years. It could even be the best film of the year.
4573	1	a	A glorious spectacle that captivates the senses and energizes the mind, The Artist is a full-bodied sensation that had me doing interior cartwheels while I sat in the theatre gluttonously consuming each and every morsel.
4574	5	a	While the multi-level Mars is an impressive backdrop there's no getting past performance capture problems.
4575	6	a	...isn't all it could be but its heart is definitely in the right place.
4576	5	a	An early watered down version of the crude comedy the Farrelly Brothers would later take to new extremes.
4577	5	a	The style is cold, the plot is creaky, and the cast is far too mannered.
4578	3	a	Spielberg's classicism comes to be appreciated in a goosebumps-inducing send-off for Mister.
4579	4	a	Jason follows the ol' tradition of monsters going into space.
4580	2	a	Michael Collins is meant to be a monument to an important figure in Irish lore, and it does a fine job of making him a monument.
4581	3	a	Like many films of late, Knocked Up is a little too long, but it's worth it in the end. Stone is so pathetic, we need extra time for Apatow to convince us that Alison shouldn't have an abortion
4582	4	a	if you loved Shaun and Hot Fuzz, don't hesitate. You need some affection for men who are having problems growing up, perhaps.
4583	3	a	Manages to overcome an inflated running time and occasional bouts of cuteness by remembering and embracing its pulp fiction roots as an 'interplanetary romance.'
4584	2	a	What this mutt lacks in uniqueness it makes up for in puppyish charm, high-class velocity and enough pop culture crackle to keep most demographics suitably amused.
4585	6	a	As if taking a cue from its own title, the movie emphatically sets its sights on the upward trajectory of Brown's career.
4586	0	a	What an enchanting movie - almost as enchanting as its location.
4587	6	a	Unobtrusive and virtually painless as an occasionally witty laugher, but lacks the courage of its convictions to follow through with its less commercial ambitions.
4588	6	a	Gooding is never allowed to play a three-dimensional character but rather ... human currency to be handed around whenever a character needs his or her consciousness raised.
4589	5	a	If the humor is smart and effective, the animation is lackluster and uneven -- the pixel pushers at Pixar have spoiled us.
4590	3	a	Adorable comedy about middle-school anxieties...and farts.
4591	4	a	What's not to like about a movie where the actors are as model-perfect as the cars?
4592	1	a	Thrums with a raw, fierce, jazzy soul.
4593	3	a	The funny and powerfully weird Rango is probably the closest I've seen a big-budget, computer-animated feature get to the comic vibe of my favorite Chuck Jones cartoons.
4594	7	a	Uneven, haphazardly constructed, and over-reliant on hackneyed symbols of yearning for independence and self-sufficiency.
4595	6	a	I'm not sure what the point of Friends with Kids is.
4596	9	a	The Angry Birds Movie is both the equivalent of a screaming five-year-old and a regressive piece of American propaganda.
4597	3	a	If only this were a media-fueled tall tale and not one poor creature's lifelong nightmare.
4598	0	a	[VIDEO ESSAY] Behind its soap opera appearance, Almodovar makes pointed political statements that bruise.
4599	3	a	I'm here to vouch for Jackson, except for the length.
4600	3	a	By never talking or shooting down to its young audience, The House With a Clock in Its Walls proves itself to be - against all odds - a thoroughly charming family film.
4601	5	a	Instead of revealing the inner sanctum of Japan's traditionalist heart, Geisha wades clumsily through a series of beautiful sets, hackneyed plots and stunning costumes.
4602	4	a	Kitsch...makes for an excellent hero, even managing to make a loincloth look like this year's must-have item.
4603	7	a	Formulaic and telegraphic, there are no surprises in this chaste, passionless movie...
4604	4	a	If you've seen Dazed and Confused, Thirteen and/or The Myth of the American Sleepover you'll know exactly what's coming.
4605	4	a	Jennifer Lawrence is the standout in a tonally uneven, eccentric romantic dramedy that fuses The Fisher King with Romy And Michele's High School Reunion.
4606	3	a	Bravely refusing to rigidly adhere to a formula that has been so successful, Wright, Pegg and Frost's Cornetto Trilogy closer has tonal shifts you won't expect, but the same beating heart you've been craving.
4607	3	a	The film is a slow burn, not building, not petering out, just becoming gradually more nerve-wracking as each plot point makes itself known. Astounding sound design by Craig Berkey.
4608	2	a	There's a rarely dramatized but profoundly understandable emotion that The Angriest Man in Brooklyn conveys: the anticipation of regret.
4609	4	a	A touching return that avoids sentiment but still manages to intoxicate.
4610	2	a	Although Altman's masterful hands manage to keep our attention from the beginning till the end, Short Cuts doesn't deserve all of the praise received by the critics.
4611	9	a	Somewhere during the transition to a live-action movie, screenwriters Jackie and Jeff Filgo have turned Greg from endearingly weedy into annoyingly insufferable.
4612	3	a	John Carter manages to be a ridiculous amount of fun, even if you are immune to the charms of Taylor Kitsch running around in what amounts to a stylish loincloth.
4613	4	a	Excellently acted version of the play is finally rather dull.
4614	4	a	Fassbender and Vikander make the film work, just.
4615	2	a	This is the kind of road trip movie that is so well done and the two characters so fully realized that I wanted the trip to continue.
4616	9	a	A ridiculous crime thriller...of elaborately idiotic moments.
4617	3	a	Four decades later, First Reformed may be the full realization of Schrader's vision.
4618	0	a	"The film's entire premise can be summed up with a bit of text from the film: ""Remember, George: no man is a failure who has friends."
4619	3	a	While it isn't the genre-breaking work it's being pitched as, it's a work of some note all the same.
4620	3	a	What rests beneath this authenticity of modern America is a tender tale of striving for one's dreams, even amongst the harshest conditions imaginable.
4621	3	a	Takes a worn-out plot and give it a surprisingly warm and fuzzy, yet very R-rated face lift.
4622	3	a	Perhaps not as dazzling as Almodovar's masterpieces, this film is still an involving and sleekly well-made melodrama.
4623	9	a	Neither so awful as to be enjoyable nor eerily artful enough to be anything other than a snoozy also-ran.
4624	9	a	The Weinstein Company went out of their way to make sure I didn't see a press screening of Hannibal Rising this week. Now I understand why.
4625	6	a	Angelina Jolie gives a mixed-bagged performance. Sometimes she is annoying, affected and just plain selfish...other times she endearing and funny
4626	3	a	Not everything works in this semi-audacious challenge to the American Dream, but Weitz consistently and amusingly hits the broad side of the barn.
4627	3	a	Director Tim Disney and screenwriter Bill Haney lay out Dee's story with a minimum of fuss. They are smart enough to realize that the material is compelling all on its own.
4628	10	a	A remarkably sniggering, tawdry sex comedy...so gross and smutty that perhaps a trenchcoat should be required apparel for every audience member.
4629	6	a	It's a heavy-handed, unsatisfying experience. A more apt title would be Melancholy and the Infinite Childhood.
4630	5	a	The premise is admittedly pretty crafty, but other than that two-minute distraction, Return to Horror High is certainly no great shake.
4631	3	a	While this charmer about a canine James Bond does not pack the emotional punch of WALL-E, it's frisky fun to see the white shepherd get a new leash on life.
4632	9	a	Despite the serious subject matter, director Brian Robbins can't decide whether this is a drama, a satire or an American Pie-style teen spoof, and the film dissolves into a shapeless, weightless mass.
4633	3	a	Violent, coarse, perverted, and sickly hilarious, this is highly recommend for those who like their entertainment on the nasty, demented tip.
4634	1	a	A moving and important portrait of legendary Times of London foreign correspondent Marie Colvin. We need more movies like this, about fearless, badass women this outrageously good at their vitally necessary work.
4635	5	a	Liman fails to use his distinct style to dust off this old sky cranker and making Robert Rodriguez look like an indie genius with the Sky Kids series.
4636	3	a	I came out of the theater as refreshed as if I were coming out of a coffeehouse.
4637	0	a	Fine Tracy-Hepburn comedy-romance directed by George Stevens.
4638	3	a	It manages to rework genre conventions with an exuberant wit and an authentic feel for the fits-and-starts madness of the mating game.
4639	3	a	From the casting choices to the soul-soothing musical score to glimpses into Japanese visual culture, it's obvious that Sofia pays careful attention that each element of the film stands strong alone, but can also contribute to the whole.
4640	6	a	The Predator offers some cosmetic changes to the heroes and the aliens. In other words, it provides nothing that's really new.
4641	7	a	'Identity Thief' gets off to a shaky start and never recovers.
4642	4	a	Offers a more imaginatively colourful world than almost every other children's film out there.
4643	7	a	A listless but lustrously shot biopic... 
4644	2	a	Leave your iPhone at home for this one or you will buy a plane ticket to Rome before you can escape the theatre.
4645	2	a	Get on Up has elements of greatness but ends up being just one step above a standard musician biopic - as result of its fairly derivative narrative
4646	3	a	Altman weaves magic from Carver's character-rich material.
4647	9	a	Sure ain't a movie. Nope, it's a product, pure and very simple and carefully tested to sell to the widest possible market.
4648	6	a	Their thoughts were how to make the book into a movie, not how to make a great movie.
4649	2	a	Perhaps the best thing about the film is that the wolves are never made to seem like strange but cuddly dogs. They look like wolves, not especially threatening but still remote and complete unto themselves.
4650	5	a	Two Weeks Notice? Two minutes would be plenty, thanks.
4651	0	a	A sensational movie, one so rich, so imaginative, so uninhibited, so full of irony that watching it is a joy of a magnitude rarely experienced at the movies.
4652	6	a	A cookie cutter creation, churned out for an existing fan base and little else.
4653	3	a	Jackie Chan and a cowboy film all in one - as inspired as Wispa's decision to add biscuit bits.
4654	5	a	The core issue with American Pastoral is the inclination to cover so much ground, and scrutinise over a myriad of themes.
4655	3	a	Dahl and scene-stealer Steve Zahn deserve praise for breathing some entertaining new life into a generally stale genre.
4656	9	a	An almost complete waste of time, talent, money, and giant mechanical spiders.
4657	2	a	"Hello, My Name Is Doris"" is at times self-consciously quirky and precious and implausible - and Sally Field is so good in it that those complaints seem pointless."
4658	1	a	A powerful film that shows us the frustration and desperation of an entire emotionally neglected sub-class, its bravura 'rap battles' offering up the strongest prima facie connection between hip-hop's chest-thumping and adolescence's shoe-gazing.
4659	3	a	I laughed uncontrollably for almost the entire length of the film.
4660	6	a	It's nice, but truthfully it never pulled me in.
4661	0	a	I'll be at the front of the line to name it one of the best films of the year.
4662	4	a	What helps the picture work - and makes some of the unnecessarily graphic bits easier to forgive - is the interaction between the two leads.
4663	5	a	John Lithgow paying his dues.
4664	4	a	Jack Black and Cate Blanchett have an easy comic rapport, affectionately bad mouthing one another and trying to steal scenes from under each other's noses.
4665	6	a	He obsessively contrives his characters and situations to work toward something -- a point, a message, a statement.
4666	3	a	Frankie Faison comes the closest to Vonnegut's spirit in his bold caricature of the Black Fuehrer of Harlem.
4667	1	a	The expressions on the characters' faces are so nuanced and complex you feel like you're watching actual people.
4668	6	a	Overall, the film is as gray and hopeless as the landscape.
4669	7	a	The next logical step for Yimou is to give up on plot altogether and simply film sword fights and death scenes set to haunting Chinese music.
4670	3	a	A dark, complex story full of twists and turns, complete with flawed heroes and voice-over narration -- The Prestige is pure Victorian noir.
4671	9	a	Paltrow gives it her best but is so conspicuously doing country. We're meant to believe she has spent half her life staring into a vodka bottle, but she glows like she's just stepped out of a yoga retreat.
4672	9	a	More often the intrusions of the comic on the dramatic aren't so much offensive as merely strange, which nevertheless torpedoes any hope of the audience taking this very seriously.
4673	1	a	It's a challenge to emerge from this immersive tale without being forever affected.
4674	3	a	Almodovar's latest feels a bit lackluster after his recent string of excellent films, but it still contains some inspired, cinema-on-cinema sequences.
4675	3	a	There's no denying Whedon's talent for dialogue, and for once, it feels less like scripted dialogue and more like real conversation.
4676	4	a	Pleasant old-school comedy with a few modern, edgy twists.
4677	3	a	Under a less masterful hand, you'd be dying for a fistfight, a sex scene or a gunshot to shatter the calm. But Koreeda makes thrilling the rich inner lives of four young women trying to navigate rocky emotional terrain in the wake of their father's death.
4678	3	a	Of course, Superman saves the world, but the real news is that there's still some life in the series.
4679	4	a	Disturbing thriller about a babysitter; cursing, violence. 
4680	5	a	dusty jokes about Mama Cass and Karen Carpenter -- how's that for topical humor? ... Unfortunately, most of the funny moments in 'Man' come when the film is playing it straight
4681	1	a	Offers the satisfaction you'd expect from a romcom and feel-good sports movie, but Lawrence and Cooper's delicate treatment of their characters makes it far more than a fleeting source of entertainment.
4682	1	a	After watching this film, you will believe that evil exists on earth. That the movie deals in truth and established facts makes it all the more disturbing.
4683	5	a	A terribly mediocre film that squanders the talent of its stars on a story that could have been funny and even thoughtful.
4684	1	a	Bardem's unnerving performance is the one that will stay with you.
4685	3	a	Touted as a disaster even before its release, its off-beat tale, visual styling and casting proves that the franchise has more than a little sting left in its tail.
4686	4	a	"Think Like a Man Too"" is even less substantial than the original, but funnier in a manic, glitzy way befitting its Vegas setting."
4687	9	a	The worst concept, execution and end product ever.
4688	6	a	What is exciting prose on the printed page becomes merely prosaic on the big screen.
4689	1	a	"Mazursky delivers one of the best lines in the film when he observes, ""It's been my observation that losers are more truthful than winners."" Amen. Here's to some losers who sometimes get to win."
4690	9	a	Kevin Smith, coming off the wonderful, challenging Dogma, fills it with sub-Road Trip gross-out jokes and expects us to buy it because he's just oh-so-ironic.
4691	5	a	Unmemorable, unfunny and unoriginal.
4692	3	a	The movie plays to every expectation the viewer might have -- the more absurd, the better. In this regard, it doesn't miss a trick. 
4693	1	a	Penn's maturation as a filmmaker is stunningly complete. Into the Wild is a riveting, spiritual revelation - one young man's journey to find himself that ends in folly unmourned.
4694	4	a	Meg Ryan struts her stuff Erin Brockovich-style; chock-a-block with moxie and the mettle of a woman who wants more.
4695	4	a	The script by Seth Rogen, Evan Goldberg, Kyle Hunter and Ariel Shaffir has an inspired stupid idea, and boundless nerve, as well as a legitimate interest in theological debate. Truly, it does.
4696	0	a	Thirty years on, bustin' still makes us feel good. In fact, few movies have the power to make us feel good-er.
4697	4	a	Bleed For This is an enjoyable but very generic and old-fashioned boxing movie.
4698	2	a	A fun, relevant, raunchy and often hilarious movie.
4699	2	a	The solid cast acts accordingly, with young Harrison distinguishing himself as a young man whose awkwardness is alternately endearing and alarming.
4700	4	a	Find-your-bliss film appeals but raises questions, too.
4701	4	a	Without the newness of the first film to give it some electricity, this Harry Potter outing comes off as harmless but flat.
4702	4	a	Relatively weak popcorn drama.
4703	2	a	A fascinating film, but for every interesting idea explored, there are just as many that don't seem to have as much relevance; the film is never focused enough to be wholly effective.
4704	2	a	How Do You Know is a well-written romantic comedy that stays away from formulas and cliches. I loved James L. Brooks' use of the close-up shot to show raw emotion.
4705	0	a	Pure, raw energy.
4706	6	a	It's impossible not to cry at their suffering, but whether you'll feel anything is another story.
4707	7	a	this celebration of a giant leap for mankind is really just a small, insignificant step for film fans.
4708	3	a	[Aniston's] approximation of a woman on a slow-drip nervous breakdown has a universal, sleepwalking quality to it that clearly took a lot of thought and craft.
4709	4	a	It's uneven story pulls it back to earth, but many of its ideas are transcendent.
4710	5	a	so familiar that you half expect Julia Stiles and Channing Tatum to show up and start hoofing
4711	3	a	The film seems to me a fair-minded stab at the truth and an irresistible look at the exercise of dynastic influence.
4712	6	a	Robin Williams doesn't need to prove he can act, not after The Fisher King, The Night Listener, Good Will Hunting and Mrs. Doubtfire. What he does in Man of the Year seems a long way from actual acting.
4713	3	a	Director Mary Harron takes a theatre of the absurd approach to the controversial best-seller.
4714	3	a	Bolt has all the wit, wisdom and top class computer imagery of a Pixar film, with the star voice cast of a Disney release.
4715	1	a	It was nice watching an adaptation that stands on its own two feet. This movie hugged me with all four arms. It is not as great, or epic as it wants to be, but it is thoroughly enjoyable.
4716	4	a	If all you do is look at performances, the historical drama is worthy of praise. Step back, and the overall production stumbles through writing mistakes, a drab look and a storytelling structure that puts the main event [too] deep into the tale...
4717	5	a	A movie about snakes on a plane does not need to be straightforward; it only has a shot if it is either genuinely scary or so incredibly over the top it's funny. Snakes on a Plane is neither, but maybe Snakes on a Boat will be better.
4718	2	a	The rawness of ... emotion translates to a palpable intensity, with the fear of losing those closest to you, either through death or through betrayal, smothering the film like a wet wool blanket.
4719	6	a	These aren't the psychologically exploded youths of Rebel Without a Cause, or even The Outsiders. They're characters in a long, violent, unbleeped episode of MTV's Cribs.
4720	3	a	Thank you, Michael Showalter, for giving Sally Field a role that shows us what it means to fully inhabit a character to illuminate the world. 
4721	5	a	If you want to see how members of a family that's fraught with discord and dysfunction learn about teamwork and the nature of kin -- and dispatch bad guys in the process -- rent The Incredibles.
4722	9	a	An uninvolving simulacrum of romance between a pair of mumbling, inarticulate boobs who have no discernible personalities apart from a shared taste in hoodies.
4723	3	a	There is a quietude to the film, even though it is punctuated by a lot of music and even more yelling. Its mood is soft and even humble.
4724	3	a	A gently intelligent action sci-fi with wit, drama, and emotion to spare, this is the blockbuster you've been waiting for all year.
4725	4	a	Trailer trash Hitchcock spliced with overboiled film noir.
4726	2	a	Hoffman's performance is filled with exasperation at a world that refuses to see things the way he does, and he gives profound voice to this commonality amongst us all.
4727	8	a	"Hopefully audiences will come to their senses and mark this one ""return to sender."
4728	9	a	Annoying music by Danny Elfman.
4729	3	a	You have to see this thing.
4730	0	a	Watching the Godfather of Soul on the big outdoor stage, you think back to his appearance in The T.A.M.I. Show a decade earlier. And then you think: I feel good.
4731	4	a	Moody thriller is spooky fun, but not much more.
4732	4	a	Shhh don't say a word ... it's not that good.
4733	2	a	It's an exciting sports movie, an inspiring tale of prejudice overcome and, above all, a fascinating study of political leadership.
4734	5	a	"If you want to see ignorant self destruction, see Troy Duffy in ""Overnight"" and forget this film---the worst mistake Josh Hartnett has made in his career."
4735	6	a	The main problem with Coach Carter can be summed up simply: too much sermonizing.
4736	4	a	"Its four main ""anti-heroes"" are such unsympathetic losers that it is difficult to care whether they live or die."
4737	6	a	A flawlessly directed film about enigmatic people who speak in morose epigrams about vague universal principles they show no sign of understanding.
4738	3	a	...a madcap comedy that rarely disappoints.
4739	1	a	for all the humor and campy shivers induced by Shadow of the Vampire, there is a disturbing undercurrent...
4740	2	a	For the first two acts, Mike Binder casts an honest look at these characters' pride and prejudices. Too bad its last act hinges more on incident and surprise than illumination or self-reflection. It mars an otherwise admirably tough-minded drama.
4741	4	a	Naomi Watts and Annette Benning give outstanding performances in this increasingly contrived and sentimental tale of mothers and daughters, and the joys and anguish that come with adoption.
4742	3	a	Trainspotting's saving grace is that there's a heck of a lot of entertainment value in this particular form of shallowness.
4743	10	a	...nothing but a sappy, shameless, and morbid production that wastes talent and time in a script designed to line the bottom of a bird cage.
4744	6	a	An unsatisfying finale.
4745	2	a	This wonderful, silly old fool doesn't need your pity, doesn't require your sympathy. Once she gets under your skin, you understand her completely. And you like her. You really like her.
4746	4	a	It's the recognizable geniality in Larry Crowne that both carries the film and which makes it deeply frustrating.
4747	4	a	Cinemas are dark. If you laugh, few people will know it's you.
4748	0	a	The film includes some of Hitchcock's finest set-pieces, including a secret hideout inside a windmill, a murder in broad daylight and a plane crash, even if the romantic subplot tends to slow things down a bit.
4749	3	a	One of the most genuinely disturbing films I have ever seen.
4750	5	a	It's tough to warm to a guy who doesn't give a damn about anyone but himself, particularly when you're supposed to be his closest confidante.
4751	7	a	Laugh-free, derivative, punishingly long 'comedy.'
4752	5	a	Spielberg should never have sold the sequel rights
4753	0	a	Funny and sad, poignant and profound, elegant and elegiac, ambitious and ambiguous, The Great Beauty is one of the most utterly enjoyable movies I've seen in years.
4754	1	a	The title doesn't refer to a misunderstanding so much as a state of being.
4755	7	a	The idea sucks on paper, and it doesn't get any better when it's on the screen.
4756	7	a	Not containing the wit to be smart, thrilling sci-fi nor the chutzpah to embrace a fun, B-movie shlock vibe, it unfortunately feels like an uninspired TV pilot that any other network would've permanently locked in a vault.
4757	6	a	In contrast to Tigger and Piglet, Lumpy offers fewer incentives to take a trip to the theatre to make his acquaintance.
4758	5	a	More like a waddling turkey than a soaring bird.
4759	2	a	Not since William Shatner saw a thingie on the wing of his plane in an old Twilight Zone has a flight been thrown into such panic by one passenger.
4760	6	a	The movie name-drops the cool stuff, the rebels of word and song, but the essence of the story and the cardboard characters who inhabit it are as mundane as can be.
4761	3	a	'Closer to Kill Bill than Crouching Tiger, it's a step backwards for the director...but still a beautiful film'
4762	4	a	This third delivery ends up having the best numbers and the most ingenious mash-up's of the franchise. [Full Review in Spanish]
4763	3	a	Poignant and often very funny, Cheadle deserves a clutch of prizes come awards season.
4764	4	a	With another in a long line of strong performances by Jackson, and some excellent basketball choreography, Coach Carter is fun, hopeful, occasionally silly and, what can I say, inspiring.
4765	4	a	Oddly being marketed as a comedy by its distributor, The Savages is best approached as a drama with an intermittently light touch that's generally more of a curse than a boon.
4766	4	a	It's hard to say who exhibits more nervous tics -- star Cage, overdoing it as an agoraphobic con man or director Scott, clearly uncomfortable with small and intimate.
4767	9	a	Audiences might [have] reasonably expected more from the seasoned action screenwriter.
4768	3	a	Miami Vice isn't a great film, but it's ours.
4769	3	a	Crowe and Phoenix are brilliant, as usual. The rest of the almost completely British cast are excellent, particularly with dialog that could have easily come out stilted or ridiculous.
4770	6	a	By Jarmusch's own previously set standards in such films as Stranger Than Paradise, Ghost Dog, and Dead Man, Coffee and Cigarettes serves up a weak brew.
4771	4	a	As usual with Bertolucci, the film's style and bravura camerawork are clearly in the forefront, but the politics and social commentary never quite find their place.
4772	2	a	...Aronofsky's taste for including horror in his films is evident from his very first feature...
4773	2	a	A smart, well-made buddy film about two junkies desperate to kick the habit.
4774	2	a	Chan's Dragon Blade is a pleasant surprise, executed with visible grandeur and can claim to be an earnestly performed, crisply edited, smart [film].
4775	5	a	An alternately raucous and sappy ethnic sitcom...you'd be wise to send your regrets.
4776	7	a	At times, the film can feel like a historical pageant, stiff and heavy-handed.
4777	4	a	Fantastic Four is what it is, and I'm okay with what it is.
4778	3	a	Looking beyond Spielberg's self-indulgence... Empire of the Sun is a gem about a kid trying to find his way all by his lonesome.
4779	4	a	Watching The Expendables is like watching professional wrestling but with guns, knives and a whole lot of death.
4780	2	a	Dizzying editing and camera work will bother some, and the sheer complexity of the telling will confuse more people.
4781	5	a	The casting's pretty fair, and if they had better material, Steve Zahn and Rachael Harris would have been real assets. But the story lurches from indignity to ill-starred wrestling match to gross-out gag, without any momentum or surprise.
4782	3	a	A very welcome memo to Hollywood that blockbusters don't have to be stupid.
4783	5	a	An intended tour de force, it is strangely unable to engage the emotions. In the end it amounts to an overweight movie that delivers less than its clever director, David Fincher, seems to think.
4784	3	a	...practices the same virtue as its characters, realizing that life is lived in the small moments as well as the great ones, and that being present in your own life is the greatest gift of all. 
4785	0	a	The result is an entrancing, deeply moving effort, one that is certain to steal the hearts of audiences on its wider release.
4786	5	a	With 'Barnyard,' the androgynous udders, as annoying as they can be, are about the only original thing to be found in the whole movie.
4787	5	a	Steven Soderbergh returns from his self-imposed retirement with a hillbilly heist movie that has too many funny accents but not enough funny lines.
4788	5	a	It's just too bad that a film purporting to espouse female empowerment has to resort to simulated fellatio, public urination, and full-frontal male nudity in order to get its biggest laughs.
4789	1	a	There's careful thought evident in suggesting what can only be conjectured. If you're going to enjoy this entertainment, don't be overly preoccupied with historical accuracy.
4790	5	a	Truly haunted by languishing in derivation and mediocrity. 
4791	0	a	Terrific entertainment
4792	3	a	Smooth polish, original writing, and good acting.
4793	3	a	A Bond movie that boldly struts forward while looking back over its shoulder to the past.
4794	1	a	See The Closet now before somebody ruins an American version by casting Robin Williams and scrubbing clean all its wanton wackiness.
4795	4	a	For the most part -- and especially thanks to Aniston's performance -- it works more than adequately.
4796	3	a	Another content-rich dramedy based on a bestseller by John Green.
4797	3	a	Flamboyantly puts across the idea, Be careful what you wish for. Ambition, power and wealth are not what they are cracked up to be.
4798	4	a	"Despite the best of intentions, a career-best performance from Kevin Costner, and outstanding work by Octavia Spencer and child actor Jillian Estell, ""Black or White"" succumbs to some of the same stereotypes it tries to dispel."
4799	5	a	A weird, incoherent, and unsettling tale that is really just a bunch of crazy and eccentric stories. [Full review in Spanish]
4800	1	a	Quite exquisite. Beautiful, really.
4801	3	a	A banquet of delicious performances, a sharp situational comedy, and an acrid send-up of contemporary mores.
4802	8	a	Not so important socially as it thinks it is, perhaps, but even more important aesthetically and thematically.
4803	3	a	If there is one subject that makes it okay to feel old-fashioned patriotism and pride in humanity... it is surely the US space program.
4804	4	a	All of this is potentially irritating to say the least, and yet, despite the junior star entitlement and teen-angst cliches, the film is unexpectedly engaging.
4805	8	a	There's absolutely nothing of merit here to discuss other than its loyalty to the original source material.
4806	0	a	Shame moves in deep waters: It shows, in the bleakest and most uncompromising terms, that the worst that war has to offer is the wounds it inflicts on the human mind.
4807	3	a	Intricate, artfully constructed and utterly assured, Love And Honour is essential viewing for anyone who has seen Yamada's earlier samurai films. If you haven't, don't miss the chance to see what is a finely tuned example of the genre.
4808	4	a	So, never work with children and animals, eh?
4809	7	a	The scenery makes you want to be somewhere other than a movie theater, and the movie has the same effect.
4810	3	a	Don Roos' dialogue is a cut above the norm.
4811	4	a	Coppola's film is about what she knows; she's obviously more ambitious than her apathetic and self-obsessed characters, but she probably knows a few of them. Far from perfect, but a solid beginning.
4812	6	a	Quaid does his level best with a lame character, but Stone sinks under the weight of a thankless role.
4813	6	a	Charlize Theron gives a very fine performance in Monster. Too bad the movie has no idea what to do with it.
4814	3	a	Maintains a delicate balance between wish-fulfillment fantasy and a recognition that the world inhabited by its audience is filled with disappointment as well as with joy...
4815	1	a	At its heart, it's an adventure story and exotic travelogue, inviting viewers to tag along as an unlikely band of fugitives from a Siberian gulag walk across the Himalayas.
4816	4	a	One of those films where great acting and occasionally brilliant dialogue attempt to overcome an unbelievable plot and a cowardly Hollywood ending.
4817	3	a	Chris Columbus' shortcomings in ingenuity and imagination don't seem terribly detrimental since the material he's working with is so infused with magic and wit
4818	4	a	Where the film separates itself is in a refreshing thread of progressiveness so rarely seen in comedies.
4819	4	a	Identity Thief isn't a great comedy in the class of McCarthy's Bridesmaids, but it's still a decent one ...
4820	3	a	The ending has a feeling of inevitability but is nonetheless shocking, a tragedy resulting from an original sin that haunts, and will continue to haunt.
4821	3	a	The unique behind-the-scenes profile Tyrnauer has achieved makes this more than just another excuse to look at beautiful models in pretty frocks, and a film not only for fashionistas.
4822	3	a	...an erratic yet heartwrenching period piece. 
4823	4	a	Ryan is clearly enjoying herself. She adroitly maneuvers her trademark cuteness into a kind of oblivious brashness -- a curious mix of brassy and brave.
4824	3	a	Like the bitter medicine your mother used to give you, The Savages can be quite effective, even if you secretly hope you never have to endure it again.
4825	6	a	Sharon Stone's teary monologue near the end of the film might be more effective if she weren't buried inside a fat suit that makes her look like Jiminy Glick.
4826	3	a	A delightfully dysfunctional romantic comedy that's moving, funny and features just the right amount of crazy love. 
4827	6	a	This is indeed the story of some people who bought a zoo.
4828	5	a	Incoherent.
4829	3	a	Repackaged way past the time when the game was a peak obsession, this animated joyride is still an irresistible invitation to shake your sillies out. 
4830	2	a	An excellent ensemble makes the most of a multi-strand female-centred film that drifts very close to melodrama as it explores various aspects of motherhood.
4831	2	a	Bad Lieutenant: Port of Call, New Orleans is a magnificent mess of the sort only Herzog can get away with making.
4832	0	a	Zhao turns material that might have been treacly and simple-minded into an allegory of male identity...with the quality of myth.
4833	0	a	There have been many classic westerns but this Hawks masterpiece certainly ranks among the best of the genre.
4834	5	a	As I sat through this two hour stumble through what looked like fog, I just kept thinking to myself how this might be the best looking bad film I've ever seen.
4835	5	a	Failure to Launch arrives pre-told by design. But even those coming in cold will know what's going to happen one step ahead.
4836	1	a	Spielberg shows that he remains the master of the form he virtually invented.
4837	6	a	Every Predator movie that worked took itself seriously. This one didn't, and it was a mess...over-the-top sci-fi.
4838	3	a	...there's no denying that the film is always completely compelling, if only on a purely visceral level.
4839	0	a	Nebraska is a film of raw beauty and great humanity.
4840	2	a	A deliciously nutty black comedy of manners.
4841	4	a	Jason X has cheesy effects and a hoary plot, but its macabre, self-deprecating sense of humor makes up for a lot.
4842	1	a	Terrific escapist fare, stylish, outrageous and compelling.
4843	3	a	"This movie simply refuses to ""normalize"" bigotry, hatred and xenophobia. And does it with a kind, understanding and forgiving heart."
4844	5	a	A waste of the talents of Melissa McCarthy and Jason Bateman.
4845	1	a	Shot in the Italian Alps, the cinematography is striking.
4846	0	a	Colombian filmmaker Ciro Guerra assumes the role of an ever-aware river guide, navigating us through the sweeping beauty of the Amazon while pointing to the toll on humanity and culture wrought by colonialism.
4847	1	a	Vertigo is a fine film, but it's not flawless.
4848	5	a	An ambitious but disjointed spoof of New Age quirks and quacks that attempts to simultaneously put down and lift up. But, despite the A-list ensemble, it accomplishes neither.
4849	6	a	Even so-called trekkies had several bones to pick with the plot and characterisation of this movie.
4850	6	a	[Its] cheery characters are ultimately stuck wending their way through wackily contrived scenarios fit for a sitcom.
4851	5	a	Take away the sumptuous settings and Hollywood glamour and what you have here is like Henry VIII for Dummies enacted by the cast of the OC.
4852	5	a	There are flashes of inspiration here, but nothing to sustain a feature film's worth of narrative import.
4853	1	a	A very entertaining and involving story of family and sacrifice.
4854	3	a	If you hate that sort of thing, then stay away. But if not, then go enjoy the trickery.
4855	1	a	The blend of charm, magic, wit, and characterization come together to make this an engaging and intellectually stimulating experience. This is a great film and one of the best of the year thus far.
4856	3	a	Unlike most movies about addictions, Down to the Bone doesn't follow the usual, comforting three-act structure -- social user develops a problem, user becomes a desperate addict, user finally gets some help.
4857	4	a	MacFarlane's comedic approach has always been that of throw everything at the wall and see what sticks. It's no different this time out, and the jokes are so plentiful that the odds are in this movie's favor for a substantial number of them to succeed.
4858	4	a	...a performance beautifully coloured with varying shades of emotion that also makes clever use of [Moore's] porcelain looks to evoke the vulnerability of the eponymous Alice.
4859	4	a	In their scenes together, Foxx and Chestnut trade sly one-liners like front-line horn players in an intimate jazz club, while Union is given her best showcase yet for her comedic timing.
4860	3	a	As with all of McDonagh's work, Mildred's almost Biblical quest for justice is marked by a dark, blistering wit, and a humanity that belies all the deeply flawed characters, hidden under their irreverent humour and often violent interactions.
4861	9	a	Unfunny, predictable, and vulgar, it's the generic equivalent of a Judd Apatow movie. As always, you get what you pay for.
4862	5	a	Catchy tunes, robust performances--but you can see every backstage-melodrama-cliche coming two scenes away.
4863	6	a	Amistad is a maddening film because it comes so close to greatness.
4864	3	a	Schindler's List, despite blatant compromises, is a rending historical document.
4865	3	a	Fascinating, as rock history, thrilling as rock entertainment. 
4866	6	a	A film sort-of from the Farrelly brothers with practically none of its charm.
4867	7	a	The film has all the building blocks to be a great fantasy ride, and Diesel is clearly enthused to be a part of it. As it turns out, though, passion isn't everything. 
4868	0	a	Thirteen Days is a gripping history lesson and a good character study, but also just a well-cast, well-executed film.
4869	9	a	Here is a film so utterly devoid of art and intellect that nothing remains other than a husk of ridiculous ploys.
4870	2	a	Aside from Letts scathing one-liners the best reason to see the film is McConaughey. His Killer Joe is a quite brilliant variation on cool villainy. 
4871	5	a	Ultimately, it's a monster movie that's the sum of less than its parts.
4872	4	a	The story is somewhat predictable, but it's sweet and happy and the animation is first-rate.
4873	9	a	Maybe it's the kudos acquired by screenwriter Roger Avary in his association with Quentin Tarantino that has allowed him to write this unbelievably boring horror-thriller.
4874	3	a	The humor is more subtle than you'd think. And we wouldn't mind seeing more of this type of thing from both Duchovny and Moore.
4875	3	a	Frances McDormand delivers a formidable, ferociously uncompromising performance in Martin McDonaugh's edgy, unpredictable, morbidly funny film.
4876	0	a	One of the most despairing movies, and yet there is in the precision of its craft and the depth of its empathy something fundamentally uplifting.
4877	2	a	Don't see Mao's Last Dancer if you want a perfectly structured film. See it if you want to experience a truly amazing story.
4878	5	a	This was a lightweight film that mistakenly thinks it's in the heavyweight class.
4879	6	a	When a film's best characters are rip-offs from other movies. you know you're in trouble.
4880	0	a	A genuine American classic.
4881	4	a	Nelson's dialogue sounds colloquially American and betrays its stage origin ... which, added to the well-fed look of many of the inmates, works against the strong acting and the inherent power of the Holocaust theme.
4882	3	a	If the symbolism is a bit heavy-handed at times, it is also intensely elevating.
4883	3	a	A high-tech thriller that really works -- both because of its eye-popping visual feats and the ideas and humanity behind them.
4884	0	a	Meryl Streep and Clint Eastwood, as Waller's tenderly plaintive heartland lovers, are so visually and spiritually right they seem to have walked right off the page.
4885	0	a	Could easily change your life.
4886	3	a	It's an experiment in character exploration. You'll walk away from it with an affirmation that people are complicated bundles of contradictions. Especially these people.
4887	7	a	Grave-ly inadequate.
4888	8	a	Made by jackasses for jackasses.
4889	6	a	Although its entertainment value to adults is negligible, it is a safe, harmless bet for families, one parents will neither regret nor fondly remember after it's over.
4890	0	a	A mega-laugh comedy about the messiness of change with lovable characters whose humor and flawed humanity make them very appealing.
4891	3	a	Hilarious, but teen sex comedy has lots of raunch, drinking.
4892	4	a	Easier to respect than to love.
4893	4	a	With Midnight in Paris, Allen may convince even those who have given up on him that there's life in the old dog yet.
4894	4	a	for a movie based on a video game, it brings what it promises
4895	0	a	In a film that is mostly black and white, small touches of color -- a candle flame; a child's coat, bright red -- bring the enormity of the tragedy into excruciating focus.
4896	9	a	I fear for humanity.
4897	6	a	It's fun, sure, but uninspired. We've seen it all before... Will Smith does his old Will Smith thing again, with only the minimum level of actual entertainment to dress it up.
4898	4	a	This Orange has some juice, but it's far from fresh-squeezed.
4899	9	a	Kevin Hart's Cedric steamrolls over everyone else with his motor-mouth tirades and physical antics. He's Roger Rabbit unleashed on the set of Dr. Phil.
4900	2	a	Natalie Portman delivers the goods in this raw and gritty western.
4901	4	a	The movie never soars like Astro Boy, but it does rise above the lack of promise that prevails in the early scenes, which is a tough thing for any movie to do.
4902	2	a	I had more fun with it than I didn't, which is more than I can say about a lot of these big budget event movies.
4903	1	a	A black but realistic comedy about life and how it sucks and also how impossible it is to fall in love with someone sane, but still it's no excuse for not enjoying yourself.
4904	1	a	Beautifully constructed, unexpectedly touching, and gorgeous to behold, it's a swirling kaleidoscope of murder, intrigue, and musical numbers that cinematic bon vivants will eagerly devour.
4905	2	a	The Coens are geniuses at creating tension through editing. No Country has craft and atmosphere aplenty.
4906	6	a	A sappy, overly familiar enterprise.
4907	8	a	"Hall"" isn't meant to be light, but it shouldn't be suffocating either, with Christensen piling on tragedies and hopelessness to a near-comical degree."
4908	3	a	Director David O. Russell, who adapted the novel, and his cast fill the story with engaging, believable characters.
4909	5	a	For a movie that's ultimately about a writer trying to come up with a better ending for his story, Window is in desperate need of a livelier conclusion of its own
4910	3	a	Sometimes a movie comes out of nowhere and wins you over. Safety Not Guaranteed is that kind of unexpected gift. 
4911	3	a	Everything about Secondhand Lions seems unlikely, outlandish and larger than life. But director Tim McCanlies ... makes it all work by throwing in charm and likability at just the right moments.
4912	6	a	While Moorhouse pulls off some quirky comic sequences, she can't quite corral the story's expanding slate of characters and tearaway themes.
4913	6	a	Lots more of the same isn't better.
4914	3	a	Old fashioned date movie for older teens.
4915	6	a	[Casting the subjects is] risky move that occasionally makes proceedings seem awfully real - but, more often, really awkward.
4916	3	a	It's a film worth queuing for - and you haven't been able to say that about anything with Clint's name on it in quite a while.
4917	5	a	The film bears less resemblance to the vintage international-intrigue movies it tries to imitate than, well, an e-cigarette does to a Gitanes. 
4918	4	a	Like many modern allegories, Nimrod Antal's tour de force of grime, fluorescence and destinationless velocity is more concerned with atmosphere than meaning.
4919	3	a	Director Tom Dey does an admirable job of capturing all the tremendous agility of Chan. It almost seems like Sammo Hung, one of Chan's best Asian directors, was working in tandem with Dey.
4920	3	a	A unique, surreal thriller.
4921	4	a	Falta alma ao filme.
4922	5	a	This is a stylish film that is constantly asking us questions. Sadly, answers are infuriatingly thin on the ground.
4923	3	a	Fincher maintains a steady tension throughout. He also adds his own tweaks to the twists at the end.
4924	1	a	A twisted revamp of Rankin-Bass by way of Edward Gorey. [Blu-ray]
4925	9	a	A flick designed so exclusively for his rabid fans that outsiders won't even understand, let alone enjoy it.
4926	1	a	It's [Penn's] warmest, most celebratory and most completely realized film and, though you might not guess it from the material, it is also arguably his most personal.
4927	5	a	[Zahn] looks perpetually on the verge of an aneurysm, relieved only by periodic slo-mo shootouts that set a new standard in post-Michael Bay preposterousness.
4928	4	a	Director Richard Donner is in good form here, and he patches up the holes in the script by keeping the action moving lickety-split.
4929	8	a	I surveyed the crowd at the screening I attended, feeling the chill in the air as seven strangers sat in stone-cold silence -- not a single laugh from anyone. The eighth moviegoer? Fast asleep five minutes in. I've never envied a person more.
4930	4	a	Ultimately, though, Crimson Peak is a movie that's only pretty good. It's fine. And for this director, working in this genre with this budget and this cast, that's almost worse than making a bad movie.
4931	2	a	You can't accuse The Dressmaker of putting style over substance because it has both in spades. 
4932	9	a	The main problem is that this Boston-set flick quite unselfconsciously presents itself as if it were a pop-culture first to express ideas about the working-mom balancing act.
4933	2	a	Thomas Wolfe professed you can't go home again. Veronica Mars proves him wrong. This trip back to her old mystery-solving stomping ground is pleasantly entertaining for the uniformed and a perfect thank you to all of the loyal fans.
4934	5	a	Mars Needs To Work Out How To Animate Humans So They Don't Look Like Possessed Shop Window Dummies.
4935	1	a	A vivid, sublime parody and valentine to the superhero genre.
4936	1	a	A postmodern animated epic, laced with film-noir savvy.
4937	5	a	[A] laugh-free affair despite the presence of the ever-reliable Jason Bateman and a supporting cast including Jon Favreau.
4938	6	a	Air Force One has neither the wit to laugh at its own absurdity nor the wisdom to mock its pretensions.
4939	4	a	Dear-hearted but fuzzy in a way that unintentional mirrors the hippie aesthetic of the Woodstock festival, Lee's film is interested not so much in the massive concert as in the Catskill Mountains community which hosted it, however unwillingly.
4940	4	a	the film offers Americans an empathetic glimpse of the country we revolted against all those years ago.
4941	6	a	A promising opening for a fun genre romp that gets worse and worse, dumber and dumber, as it goes along.
4942	3	a	Funny, charming, and a feast for the eyes. It is also quite probably the best animated film made by Disney in years.
4943	3	a	This film resonates with truth and feeling without ever preaching.
4944	6	a	In many ways it looks an awful lot like one of those generic made-for-TV disease-of-week movies.
4945	4	a	We're always aware of the formula--and in a picture based on real life, we shouldn't be.
4946	3	a	Rather than use his finesse on behalf of his own power drive, Felt is devoted to something more abstract: the rule of law.
4947	0	a	The film bubbles merrily throughout.
4948	5	a	Sadly, the issue-based plot is not executed well.
4949	2	a	a great, clever concept, and it's family fun
4950	4	a	Bruce Willis is rather terrifying.....a man of many faces indeed
4951	1	a	Egoyan's intent is not ultimately to disturb us, but to look closely at people at their wits' end, desperate, and sad, in hopes of finding absolution for them.
4952	5	a	It wants to be a big, serious movie. It has big, serious star power and big, serious themes. There are moments of power and flickers of meaning but it is ultimately hollow and unsatisfying.
4953	1	a	Heffalump is a film of small charms, but what delights are there sound out loudly in today's depressing kid film marketplace.
4954	5	a	Instead of being a sharp, witty comedy about married couples experiencing vacation therapy together, it's more of a pinheads-in-paradise routine with only a few funny lines.
4955	3	a	Think of Shults's film ... as the end of the world by lantern light: intimate and flickering up close, with unfathomable blackness beyond.
4956	5	a	Deserves to be hanging in the nearest meat locker.
4957	6	a	Young Hanks and Fisk, who vaguely resemble their celebrity parents, bring fresh good looks and an ease in front of the camera to the work.
4958	3	a	Papa's got a secondhand bag? ... As self-consciously arty and formulaic as it sometimes is, the film stays with you thanks to Chadwick Boseman's shrewd, powerhouse performance ... 
4959	6	a	Possesses the same peculiar blend of hard-edged violence and insufferable cuteness that has effectively kept anime underground in the States.
4960	5	a	It isn't based on a book series. But it feels like it is. And perhaps it should be. 
4961	6	a	Christopher Robin can't reconcile its darkness and its light.
4962	9	a	How could a movie with so many exciting elements be this boring? 
4963	2	a	With a tighter plot and more consistent tone, American Hustle could have had a shot at greatness.
4964	1	a	One of the most intelligent and genuinely scary ghost stories to come around in a long time.
4965	6	a	Ultimately just an over-the-top, patently silly lark, and on those terms, it is diverting and even a little sweet on occasion. The line between what is smart and funny and what is cheap and unamusing is one the filmmaker hasn't yet quite mastered.
4966	4	a	Eastwood's imperfect debut movie is a thiller full of personality and zest.
4967	4	a	"Essential viewing for understanding how banks systematically targeted low income groups in over-leveraged mortgage lending practices that led to a catastrophic economic collapse, ""American Casino"" is still a far from perfect documentary."
4968	4	a	Although the big reveal flops, what follows is a lot better - the film switches into a punchy chase flick, complete with swearing, gunfire and wince-inducing hand-stabbings to spare.
4969	9	a	The film turns to that old reliable standard, commedia dell'gassy.
4970	0	a	A classic whodunit.
4971	6	a	less than I had hoped for...but just about what I had expected.
4972	1	a	Inspiring messages about equality, forgiveness and understanding resonate thanks to Clint Eastwood's deft hand and standout performances by Morgan Freeman and Matt Damon.
4973	9	a	Grisly, gory, over-the-top action-parody isn't for kids.
4974	9	a	It may be the only movie ever to feature a bad performance by Johnny Depp, one of the best actors working in films. Who knew he could be wooden and unconvincing in a role?
4975	1	a	...will undoubtedly come under fire for being all over the place, but that's like complaining a trapeze artist shouldn't be performing so far up in the air. The movie exhilarates precisely because it takes random, high-altitude risks.
4976	7	a	Lacks any force or energy to release it from the pull of total mediocrity.
4977	5	a	unfathomably unfunny... centered around mean-spirited fat jokes
4978	4	a	...there is enough originality in 'Life' to distance it from the pack of paint-by-number romantic comedies that so often end up on cinema screens.
4979	9	a	One for the kids, if they're really misbehaving.
4980	4	a	As a journalist, I can't come down too hard on a film's action scenes when they include a half of a car speeding through a newsroom and a shootout in an area where massive spools of newspapers are stored. 
4981	1	a	You'll see relative unknown Farmiga deliver one of those subtle, controlled, humane performances that should win Oscars but never do because the Oscars are a lot of jive.
4982	4	a	For what it is -- viewed as filmmaking in and of itself -- Serenity is tense and smoothly put together.
4983	2	a	A really funny, crass and often thoughtful comedy that doesn't overstay its welcome.
4984	3	a	If you're in the market for a tranquil, meditative holiday but can't quite pony up the cost, this surprisingly engaging film will do just as well. 
4985	8	a	"Repetitive, repulsive, empty while stuffed with cheap ennui and wholly lacking in either insight or inspiration, ""Saint Laurent"" is absolutely everything you don't want to see in a biographical film."
4986	6	a	The film should have either been about the burglary or about romantic intrigues, not about both.
4987	0	a	Whether you are young, old or somewhere in the middle, make sure you find time for this Saga saga.
4988	1	a	"With ""The Silver Linings Playbook,"" Russell picks up the traditional quirky rom-com genre and shakes it around, just to see what happens. Where it's going is fairly predictable; how it gets there isn't. "
4989	7	a	The shareef won't like it, but can you blame him? Rock the Kasbah is a dreadful excuse for a comedy that will make you question your faith in Bill Murray.
4990	3	a	Somber and thought-provoking, 'Hereafter' is a think piece, a serious film that provides no answers but does supply viewers with a lot of 'what ifs.'
4991	3	a	Even if it goes on past full-term, it never seems like labor: more like a big bungle of joy.
4992	5	a	This is the kind of film you go to for only one reason: you're a teenager, you're on a date, and you're ready for an excuse to grip someone tightly.
4993	5	a	As stale as last week's wedding cake.
4994	4	a	McGregor's directorial debut is a well-crafted drama but lacks the depth of Roth's masterful book.
4995	7	a	The story unfolds in a choppy flashback structure that robs the story of any momentum, there's never a strong emotional connection to the characters and each clumsy plot dump contradicts the previous clumsy plot dump.
4996	3	a	It's the least of Pegg and Wright's three creative collaborations, but nonetheless diverting for those tuned to its hyper-pop-culture wavelength.
4997	3	a	In its metaphysical concerns and challenging notions about personal and social responsibility, the film aims much higher than most American youth pictures.
4998	3	a	... delivers the expected adrenaline-driven thrills with a fresh eye and a refreshing attitude...
4999	6	a	While many of the characters are getting satisfactorily high, audiences are unfortunately left with a movie that's only half-baked.
5000	3	a	If it's not Toy Story, well, what is? But Bee Movie offers plenty of entertainment for all ages -- though, truth be told, the older the better.
5001	3	a	As the poor shlub fighting several battles at once -- all of them against shrewder, meaner adversaries -- Douglas is a complex and sympathetic Everyman.
5002	4	a	This is a paint-by-numbers procedural that expects the audience to know the history of Watergate, hits the ground running-but then feels more like a steady jog through the past than a fast-paced thriller.
5003	1	a	While it isn't the best picture to come out of Hollywood this year, nor is it Capra's masterpiece, it tells a good story and its conclusion has a heart-warming effect on the audience.
5004	4	a	For West fans only; the double entendres are cute by today's standards and Grant looks great.
5005	3	a	If it wasn't based on a true story you could easily dismiss this film. But the fact that this really did happen sort of changes everything, and watching Vinny's remarkable comeback, along with sensational acting, gives audiences a lot to root for here.
5006	6	a	A disappointing step downward ... betraying what simple vision the original film had.
5007	4	a	I object to the movie not on sociological grounds but because I suspect a real geisha house floated on currents deeper and more subtle than the broad melodrama on display here.
5008	6	a	Timberlake has his breakout performance here, proving that he's not some pretty boy from a teen pop idol group.
5009	2	a	It feels like an homage to everything, as its likable heroines slowly wander through a movie wasteland filled with familiar landmarks
5010	6	a	A visually stunning modern-day epic in which the protagonist, unfortunately, remains a blur.
5011	4	a	The Way Back is a robustly made picture, heartfelt, well executed with an exhilarating sense of reach and narrative ambition. Where it falls down is a lack of personal intensity to match the spectacle.
5012	10	a	If you are looking for a breath of fresh Eire, you are in the wrong movie.
5013	2	a	Finally, a role that makes sense for Cage to play ... locking into the exhausted craziness he has unintentionally perfected in a handful of terrible movies.
5014	4	a	A lavish musical, too lavish for the subject matter, though.
5015	10	a	OK, I get it now: Aaron Seltzer and Jason Friedberg are agents of Satan himself, and their recruitment video is Meet the Spartans...a new low even for these diseased buffoons.
5016	3	a	A pleasantly ramshackle affair balanced uniquely between the crass and the sweet.
5017	7	a	Clumsy exposition, convenient coincidences, wild assumptions and blatant foreshadowing drive the story.
5018	6	a	The problem is that there is very little chemistry between the actresses, and Haynes and screenwriter Phyllis Nagy are far too studied in their depiction of passion.
5019	1	a	truly exhilarating
5020	5	a	This playful endeavour is undoubtedly an entertaining one, but is too stony-faced in parts, which is to the film's detriment.
5021	5	a	Hart's shtick - he talks smack, his challenger reacts, he tries to hide - is already beginning to show signs of almost being tired, or at least in need of a change-up.
5022	0	a	From the very first words you hear in My Dog Skip, you know you have hit a rare, precious breed of movie, one that honors and rejoices in the language.
5023	5	a	Essentially a glib soap opera whose main characters are two-dimensional cliches used as clotheslines on which to hang sitcom-level jokes.
5024	4	a	The new outlook, fresh cast and leaner chassis suggest that the franchise can really kick on from here, but it's hard not to feel that Skyfall itself is something of a missed opportunity. Better luck next time, James. Again.
5025	6	a	The Predator doesn't quite work because it's never quite clear what it wants to be and, when it finally does snap into focus, it's about the wrong things.
5026	4	a	Not-bad domestic drama
5027	0	a	The Artist is so wonderful that the audience applauds everything, including the dog.
5028	7	a	It is not unusual for an underdog sports picture to be predictable. But The Miracle Season seems downright preordained, and not just in its arc.
5029	4	a	This Jane is packing heat, but the film's love triangle is ice cold.
5030	3	a	Ciro Guerra's excesses in arthouse symmetry tend to arrive in the service of a just and angry correctivism.
5031	1	a	Kontroll is the first work by a director who is clearly gifted and who has found a way to make a full-bore action movie on a limited budget.
5032	5	a	Fantastic Four is terribly miscast. It's poorly written, visually uninteresting, and worst of all, boring. The film drags considerably. There are huge gaps without any action and it brings the pacing to an unbearable crawl.
5033	3	a	It's hard not to want A Most Wanted Man to go on forever, if only to spend time in the company of Hoffman - one of the great actors of his, or any, generation.
5034	6	a	These people are mostly meat-and-potatoes, what-you-see-is-what-you-get, and Payne and screenwriter Bob Nelson frequently portray their Midwestern brethren with disdain and a lack of compassion.
5035	3	a	The type of film I imagine you could return to time and again only to discover previously unseen layers.
5036	9	a	Remember Wild Wild West? Well...
5037	5	a	A cerebral comedy that's too anxious to demonstrate how clever and erudite it is to bother creating...a narrative that's more than an affected faux-philosophical puzzle.
5038	4	a	Darker than expected but with a good theme: moms are great. 
5039	5	a	The less you engage your brain, the more you'll enjoy National Security.
5040	1	a	About more than Bosnia: it's about the immigrant experience; it's about tolerance; it's about making a difference; it's about learning to make the best of what one has.
5041	0	a	I couldn't get enough of this movie. Alfie is one of the best movies I have seen all year, and Jude Law should get another Oscar nomination 
5042	4	a	The Skulls turns out to be such a mediocre, listless effort.
5043	4	a	Connery and Zeta-Jones's combined charisma keeps Entrapment watchable. What it doesn't, however, is make this action adventure terribly exciting.
5044	6	a	It's an escalating contest of can-you-top-this brutality, with each death staged as the final link in a Rube Goldberg chain reaction.
5045	3	a	It's a warm, fuzzy indie and a covert sci fi triumph. 
5046	3	a	Odd drama about eccentric show biz family, featuring Jerry Lewis in rare dramatic role.
5047	3	a	The true story of a landmark case about abduction for marriage in Ethiopia that stands up for the dignity and rights of women everywhere.
5048	6	a	Folks will come away from the film mistaking a warmth for their own experiences with an over-abundance of affection for My Big Fat Greek Wedding.
5049	4	a	Location is Fincher's strongest quality, and every log cabin, train station and archival vault here feels lived-in, bone-chillingly cold and full of surprises.
5050	3	a	A breath of fresh air in a genre too often controlled by Hollywood teen-pap.
5051	3	a	It's a story of first love: impossible, impermanent, and passionate.
5052	3	a	First Reformed is a compelling slow burn.
5053	8	a	...truly dismal...This is a movie to avoid.
5054	3	a	This stylish, well acted drama chronicles one once-successful dot-com's efforts to stay afloat in the wake of the Internet boom's bust.
5055	5	a	Moderately suspenseful, but...a good horror movie like this requires one of two things: interesting heroes or at least a conceptually interesting villain. Here we are given neither.
5056	3	a	For all the pre-release chatter of Skyfall being 'Bond with a capital B', steeped in 'a magical Goldfinger feel', it's a film that fights surprisingly shy of the franchise's time-honoured rites.
5057	7	a	If you thought Elizabeth: The Golden Age was over the top, just wait until you get a load of how her mother is portrayed in this risible soap opera.
5058	3	a	Directed with imagination and sensitivity by Paul McGuigan, Film Stars Don't Die In Liverpool is a real heartbreaker filled with laughter, tears and all the authentic rollercoaster emotions of a great and tragic love story.
5059	1	a	What could have been one of the year's best films is tripped up by a couple of sloppy contrivances.
5060	0	a	"Watching Del Toro's films is a pleasure because his vision is evident in every frame. Best of all, though, is his belief that ""what terrifies him will terrify others."" He's right."
5061	5	a	When Richard Wright went wrong.
5062	3	a	Even when the material is rather thin and obvious -- and it sometimes is -- Sharif and Boulanger's performances make Monsieir Ibrahim agreeable.
5063	4	a	Likeable leads and the odd good joke makes this romance an amiable time-passer.
5064	6	a	Wasikowska creates a wonderful heroine with her porcelain features and lily white complexion. But Hiddleston and Chastain are so overtly villainous that their reactions elicit unintended laughs.
5065	1	a	Our Little Sister is a serene, enchanting film that transports us to another, gentler world.
5066	5	a	Stay is a heartless puzzle that builds no empathy for its characters, no pathos at all, as it is giving us many cryptic clues that don't really lead to that finale. It's an intellectual exercise, not an emotional one.
5067	4	a	The resulting film has warmth rather than spark, but that ultimately doesn't matter. Two Weeks Notice is an enjoyable bit -- fluffy, silly and fine for the season.
5068	9	a	The road from TV star to movie leading man is loaded with ill-conceived films.
5069	5	a	Really bad. Sometimes funny
5070	3	a	It has sequences of balletic martial arts action that can knock you back, open-mouthed, in your comfy multiplex chair. Yet the movie amounts to frustratingly little by the time it's over.
5071	0	a	In Sound City, a raucous yet sweetly romantic documentary, dinosaurs do indeed rock the Earth again.
5072	5	a	A critic can stay alert through movies that would put elephants into comas, but I doubt most people will stay awake for Max Payne.
5073	0	a	This is the feel-good movie of the year and that's meant as praise, not a putdown.
5074	6	a	Brendan Gleeson's force of personality dominates the proceedings. As a historic document, however, the film leaves a lot to be desired.
5075	3	a	The melodrama of Indecent Proposal is a throwback to Douglas Sirk's brand, in that it seeks to subvert the status quo rather than support it, offering a biting criticism of contemporary marriage.
5076	6	a	A silly, self-indulgent film about a silly, self-indulgent filmmaker.
5077	5	a	David Cronenberg takes a wayward shot at making a film out of Don DeLillo's artful novel Cosmopolis. Cronenberg's version drones and flounders.
5078	1	a	...up there with the greatest films of the genre, [although] the director's approach may be somewhat excessive in terms of violence.
5079	6	a	consistently flat and uninspired, as if everyone is working on a different page
5080	6	a	The material ... is much like its protagonist -- single-tracked and badly in need of a cold shower.
5081	6	a	There is very little heart to all the mad rush in the movie.
5082	2	a	A solid cloak-and-dagger actioner.
5083	5	a	A soppy, disorganized melodrama with a lot of big ideas and virtually no significance.
5084	4	a	It's a pleasant, good-natured film that's easy to enjoy.
5085	0	a	It's ironic that the director that produced some of the worst films of all time has gotten one of the best Hollywood-themed biopics ever made about him, but there's little doubt that Tim Burton's Ed Wood is a superb film.
5086	4	a	Nicholas Stoller's film throws up surprises in the way it tackles gay marriage and female empowerment without irony and extracts poignancy from Seth Rogen and Zac Efron's returning man-child characters.
5087	3	a	Singular in its location and singular in mood.
5088	0	a	To feel gripped, on edge and moved in such a short period of time is of real commendation to Tyldum, who takes his audience through the motions in this unforgettable piece. 
5089	3	a	A well-crafted, albeit entirely bleak exploration of paranoia and fear.
5090	4	a	Overall, Paper Towns is a good and solid, if somewhat lengthy, film. The film is structurally and visually conventional with the odd glimmer of indie quirk.
5091	3	a	Entertainment that propels the audience inexorably from one excitement to the next.
5092	6	a	I wasn't prepared to see such inanity from Will Smith.
5093	3	a	As a group of episodes, the movie keeps our interest not by linear plot, but by finely drawn characterizations.
5094	4	a	"The curious are welcome, but this one fits snugly in the category of ""You Don't Have to Be Jewish, But..."" "
5095	0	a	Don't let the simplicity of the story fool you, 'The Artist' is a movie in which the pleasures lie entirely in the details.
5096	5	a	"The Flowers of War"" seems like a pretty good film until you begin to think about it."
5097	7	a	This is a significant step down from Animal Kingdom...
5098	3	a	Scott tucks away his visual athletics in favour of something leisurely and quietly devastating. It's ultimately far more cunning a script than we can reveal here.
5099	6	a	"When Ted sits on his couch watching a clip from ""Roots"" and compares his situation to that of Kunta Kinte getting whipped, you may want to sink into your seat."
5100	1	a	Perhaps the most compelling thing Ready Player One and the OASIS provides is the glimpse at our inevitable future.
5101	4	a	Whether a product of the script as written or of Curran's directorial decisions, the second half of Chappaquiddick plays like comedy.
5102	5	a	This Tommy Boy is no pinball wizard, but you may leave the theatre wishing that the character were at least deaf, dumb, and blind.
5103	1	a	This is one genuinely scary, disturbing movie.
5104	3	a	Fey's character, who has the convincing cynicism of a career journalist, grows in experience as the conflict deepens, and Carlock's deft debut screenplay ensures that death and absurdity hover on either side of a knife edge.
5105	6	a	Space Jam is, perhaps, best viewed as a 'package,' something put together by agents and dealmakers rather than filmmakers.
5106	1	a	The Imitation Game is a great story that's well-told, about a man who was different from many of us -- which is to say that he was exceptional at a time when the world needed such a man most.
5107	5	a	Identity Thief is an odd mix of edginess, slapstick, and serious drama that is only occasionally satisfying.
5108	0	a	This is the all-time great, curl-up-on-the-sofa-with-a-cup-of-tea movie. Not only is it beautifully photographed, but it also contains enough emotional strength to hold your attention for all of its two-hour running time.
5109	6	a	By and large, Witchboard is a movie I enjoy, but mostly for the nostalgia factor and the fact that Tenney was taking some risks at that particular time in the genre. 
5110	0	a	This fact-based drama pulls off a fairly tricky feat -- it's touching, thoughtful, sad, funny, sweet and ultimately redemptive -- and all at once.
5111	6	a	The fact that this trilogy has concluded is for the best. There's nowhere else for these characters to go.
5112	4	a	...a passable effort that receives plenty of mileage out of Damon's expectedly engaging performance...
5113	1	a	Right from the start, Rodriguez peppers his film with a delightful potpourri of elements.
5114	6	a	The story trails off in so many directions that it's hard to follow. After a while, I just found myself losing interest.
5115	3	a	"These kinds of Hollywood pop stardom portraits usually flop or fly based on their casts and the ebullience of their musical scenes. ""Get on Up"" wins on both fronts."
5116	0	a	Not since Fargo have the Coen Brothers made such a perfect movie.
5117	6	a	The Angry Birds Movie gets the job done, but there are strange tonal shifts here and a surprising amount of off-color jokes.
5118	3	a	Its hero may lack any real super bark but this comic cartoon comes with a sharply ironic bite.
5119	9	a	...has half the racing scenes, twice the plot and none of the Vin Diesel.
5120	6	a	Valentine is far from perfect, but not a bad film.
5121	4	a	Engagingly silly film.
5122	3	a	This is neither Fonda's finest role nor a very challenging one - it's a cleavage and one-liner affair - but it's fun and entertaining.
5123	3	a	Matt Damon...yeah, he's still a badass.
5124	2	a	...a polished, well-made, and unaffectedly inspiring motion picture about an inspiring individual and an inspiring victory.
5125	3	a	Martin's one-liners are pretty funny, very dry, and awfully quotable.
5126	0	a	Does American Hustle have heart -- does it have importance? Such naive questions: It has Jennifer Lawrence blowing up a microwave.
5127	3	a	It's happy to wallow in the conventions of classics that came before it, and we're happy to wallow right with it, but the potential to become something more eludes it.
5128	9	a	Bleed for This mostly removes the rough edges of boxer Vinny Pazienza to tell a predictable comeback story that, at best, is worth a made-for-TV movie.
5129	7	a	The Skulls is less interested in politics than in profitably flattering the suspicions and resentments of its intended teenage audience.
5130	1	a	This cinematic folk song embraces and celebrates the chasm between idealized outlaw myth and the unglamorous realities of frontier thievery.
5131	4	a	Sharp comic timing; a solid supporting cast.
5132	9	a	It's an exploitation film fraught with faux-sincerity, and ultimately it's utterly ridiculous.
5133	1	a	There's no denying the film's savage power
5134	3	a	If you hunger for something off the safe, mainstream path, let Moan bewitch you with its unusual healing process.
5135	0	a	The melodrama to end all melodramas.
5136	8	a	The actresses are so wasted, they're even demoted to fifth, sixth, seventh and eighth billing under every one of the dudes. At least the guys aren't having fun either.
5137	8	a	One of the absolute masterpieces of populist cinema.
5138	6	a	Imagine the James Woods character from Videodrome making a home movie of Audrey Rose and showing it to the kid from The Sixth Sense and you've imagined The Ring.
5139	4	a	Fueled as much by Daniel Craig's vulnerable portrayal of Bond as its crisp action sequences, Mendes offers a rock-solid entry in the long-running franchise.
5140	3	a	Fine candy for mind and eye.
5141	6	a	An impersonal, borderline-mechanical experience book-ended by the dramatic warmth its middle hour hasn't a speck of.
5142	6	a	Like a delicious oven confection that has us clamoring for its final outcome, once the door is open too soon - it flattens on sight.
5143	3	a	"The movie probably hits the left harder than the right, but ultimately ""Team America"" aims to make everybody wince and make everybody laugh."
5144	3	a	Filled with an infectious love for the region's songs.
5145	3	a	More reality show than fashion show, it's slight but still as fun as it is fashionable.
5146	4	a	"While ""Identity Thief"" isn't one of the best road-trip movies to come our way, Melissa McCarthy makes the journey worth it."
5147	0	a	Charlize Theron delivers a bit of her soul within the bravest woman's role in years.
5148	4	a	Writer Barry Levy has added some snap, crackle and pop to what would otherwise be a routine action film had it been presented in chronological order.
5149	5	a	It's a strange feeling to see the summer's most promising premise self-destruct into something bizarre and unsatisfying, but that is the Hancock experience.
5150	8	a	An obnoxious and repulsive comedy that consistently wastes the talents of its two charismatic stars.
5151	4	a	Subverts the usual Gothic and horror tropes by giving Mia Wasikowska's Edith a sex life that doesn't lead to punishment. But she's soon turned into just another token damsel in distress. 
5152	3	a	An enjoyably gruff and candid baseball biopic.
5153	7	a	This is a movie for those who could care less about a bad premise or, for that matter, misfired gags, false sentimentality and obtuse characters.
5154	0	a	One of Audrey's finest dramatic moments
5155	6	a	I'm not recommending it for those who know the original, but it might work nicely enough for those who have not.
5156	4	a	The trip is a little too academic to reach its own heart.
5157	1	a	This measured yet excitingly tense, violent yet maturely sorrowful thriller marks the first time the filmmakers have faithfully adapted somebody else's work to their own specifications and considerable strengths.
5158	3	a	It's the perfect material for Russell, who not only deals perceptively with the dizzying swings of manic depression, but makes it the fabric of a big, generous, happy-making ensemble comedy.
5159	5	a	The film covers The Texas Chainsaw Massacre by way of Rob Zombie, Quentin Tarantino, and Ti West. 
5160	7	a	If not for the music, Country Strong would barely be a wimper at your neighborhood multiplex.
5161	3	a	The Bourne Supremacy offers cool thrills and explosive action.
5162	3	a	This first chapter of Peter Jackson's new Tolkien trilogy takes us back to the familiar settings and characters, inflating a simple journey into an epic adventure in the process.
5163	3	a	The constant gear-changing -- or tonal shifts -- may put some audience members off a bit. But it also has style to burn, and most of the cast is appealing, especially the brooding Csanyi, and Balla, whose sunny presence brightens up the dark proceedings.
5164	1	a	The filmmakers expertly balance historical homages and modern action.
5165	6	a	These performers, as inspired as some of them are, spoil a sinister book with earnest acting.
5166	0	a	A film totally in thrall to the lure/peril of looking, and filmed almost entirely from the perspective or emotion of the subconscious.
5167	2	a	[The] film's profound identification with its teenage characters is ultimately its saving grace. 
5168	0	a	Mendes and Co. has an astutely cunning way to keep our blood pumping every minute of the latest and, arguably, best time we've had with the enduring Bond in years.
5169	9	a	How did Kevin Smith gain any fan base? This clunker made a bundle.
5170	1	a	Succeeds because it never takes itself that serious despite its heady premise.
5171	4	a	Quirky character study in Nazi evil.
5172	6	a	Let's just say this is the sort of movie where if a character is shown climbing up some shrubbery, you just know a branch will break and send him tumbling earthward.
5173	3	a	Boundlessly enjoyable, extravagant to look at, and a frequent adrenaline rush.
5174	3	a	a funny and compassionate tribute to the unemployed.
5175	1	a	A smartly written, confidently directed film that delivers big laughs while developing two of the year's most earnest characters and some of its most rewarding sentiments.
5176	6	a	The corny, greeting-card feel of the second half weakens what begins as a creatively rendered take on a holiday film.
5177	1	a	...the bodily invasions are not only reflective of a psychological state, but of a socioeconomic one as well.
5178	1	a	A single ricochet gunshot propels the plot and dramatically alters the lives of the quintet. The result is a vengeful, five-way battle of wits.
5179	4	a	As a mood-piece it has lovely spells.
5180	4	a	When the film begins to drown in its own good intentions, it's these actors who float to the top keep it from sinking into the depths of mawkish melodramatics.
5181	6	a	It's fun to watch superheroes who aren't quite at ease with their abilities, but The Incredibles -- last year's similarly themed animated film -- is livelier and funnier.
5182	3	a	As pure comedy, it's a hoot.
5183	9	a	An epic fail on every conceivable level.
5184	0	a	"As God as my witness, I get teary eyed every time Harry Bailey offers that toast to his ""big brother, George. The richest man in town."
5185	2	a	'Paper Heart' is a strange hybrid of documentary and fiction filmmaking that might have been more enjoyable had it stuck with strictly with the facts.
5186	10	a	A climax so dark you'll need braille subtitles to get through it. 
5187	4	a	... A visual and technical achievement, but underwhelming on every other level.
5188	4	a	Billy Elliot is charming and entertaining. It's a bit of British fluff, enjoyable and lightweight. 
5189	4	a	Surprisingly dull and weightless...the direction of the image is often bland and functional.
5190	2	a	A tribute to ultra-low budget explorations into the unknown and the politically incorrect. This is the stuff that art is made of.
5191	5	a	A crude teen-oriented variation on a theme that the playwright Craig Lucas explored with infinitely more grace and eloquence in his Prelude to a Kiss.
5192	3	a	...the film still clicked for me because it was set around a realistic situation to which many people can relate and was peppered with laughs and even some genuine emotion.
5193	5	a	[A] frenetic jumble of subplots and sleazy characters...
5194	6	a	The black-and-white overlong, dated and uneven film, a less than endearing talk-fest, is rescued from drowning in a sea of words by its fine cast.
5195	4	a	"Too bad most of the fun on-screen seems to be reserved for the people who actually made ""The Tourist"" - while all we get is a postcard."
5196	5	a	MacFarlane has lost his way.
5197	1	a	Vital and brilliant, without American Beauty's occasional pretension, it's a shot in the arm for the dull holiday season, a shattering experience well worth having.
5198	0	a	Films this good come along once, maybe twice in a lifetime.
5199	5	a	Save a place at the cemetery for this film.
5200	6	a	...a movie based on an ending. And if you can't figure out that ending ten minutes into the movie, you aren't paying attention.
5201	2	a	Whether Mr. Mendes is deploying an explosion or a delectable detail, he retains a crucially human scale and intimacy, largely by foregrounding the performers.
5202	3	a	The film is a visual feast with just enough shocks to ensure you don't mistake this for some well-mounted costume drama. It is the stuff of a beautifully vivid nightmare. 
5203	1	a	An exceptional film in many ways.
5204	0	a	A historical document as well as powerful, disturbing drama
5205	3	a	If you can laugh at campy perversity, there are enough snappy one-liners, hilarious sight gags and wonderfully twisted situations to put you on the floor.
5206	9	a	The movie strolls right past absurdity into offensiveness, by trying to pass this pulp nonsense off as noble art.
5207	1	a	There's value in films about supernatural heroes and bigger-than-life villains, but the ones that stick with us feature characters we can relate to. Apatow has given birth to that sort of film, and he should be a very proud papa.
5208	1	a	It delivers a particular kind of visceral historical spectacle that movie audiences haven't seen in decades.
5209	3	a	Explosively funny.
5210	3	a	Stallone's honest and human portrayal of a decent man who's let too much go by makes this film work.
5211	7	a	Hard to endure due to its pretentious nature, but deserves credit for inspiring a unique form of wrath - rage against the Cronenberg
5212	0	a	'shows the consequences of what we have done in the past and the danger of where we are heading'
5213	3	a	The film is far from being Rogen's most ingenious work, but as a raunchy comedy it never holds back. [Full review in Spanish]
5214	5	a	This is a really stupid movie and that's really disappointing since I really did enjoy the first one.
5215	0	a	Selma achieves the rare accolade of being a powerful period piece with stark contemporary resonance.
5216	3	a	The story is so perfect for cinema you have to remind yourself it actually happened.
5217	9	a	Gets off to such an incoherent start that it takes almost the entire, interminable two-hour-plus running time to catch up.
5218	8	a	With the unwavering assurance of a seasoned veteran at the top of his form, visionary director Clint Eastwood scores again with this brilliant, powerful, compelling underdog story.
5219	3	a	The Bourne Identity is a firm foundation for an espionage film franchise that could very well decommission Fleming's Bond or Tom Clancy's Jack Ryan.
5220	9	a	"With the exception of the original ""Jurassic Park"", films based on Crichton's novels have been not only unsuccessful but horrendously awful."
5221	4	a	The movie still entertains -- thanks to Downey's staccato rhythms and Foxx's secret melodies. But it remains flawed.
5222	4	a	Cronenberg's DeLillo adaptation has some interesting ideas, presents an intriguingly sealed-off view of the world and features a genuinely superb performance from Robert Pattinson...
5223	2	a	It's... got more insight and honesty behind its use of expletives than any other piece of writing to hit the screen this summer, and as a result, the humour finds different layers to bounce through.
5224	3	a	Portraying a version of Disney's Snow White, [Adams] owns the character, down to every warble and twirl.
5225	4	a	Often very funny and more consistent than the first. 
5226	4	a	Despite his mainstream-heavy sensibility Marshall has crafted a textured film companion to Arthur Golden's stunning masterwork.
5227	9	a	Four installments later, the horror-movie jokes have gotten broader, grosser and just plain dumber.
5228	3	a	"Still Alice""might sound maudlin, or more on the frequency of a made-for-TV movie than what it is. But this is not only sensitive material handled with tact, it's also sensitive material bolstered and braced by Moore's stunning performance."
5229	4	a	Oh for a smarter story, with a brisker pace, to support such excellent talents. At least we still get to experience the good, the bad and, if not the ugly, then the so-so.
5230	6	a	While on its own lowbrow terms the movie may work well enough, 'Kick-Ass' outpoints this 'Smart-Ass' cousin by a wide margin.
5231	4	a	Peter Weir makes this wartime tale a sleek, rousing, old-fashioned adventure instead of a somber, self-important epic slog. 
5232	3	a	The Prestige plunges us into a world of deception as means, end and the whole point, really.
5233	8	a	So preposterous that you not only have to put your brain on hold but remove it from your skull, toss it to the floor and stomp it into insensibility.
5234	9	a	An extended sitcom for kids, with very little to entertain adults.
5235	3	a	David Fincher's American version of The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo is a powerhouse of a picture. And, in an incredible feat, Rooney Mara wrests the role away from the unforgettable Noomi Rapace in the Swedish version -- Mara and Fincher make it her own.
5236	0	a	Exquisite study in emotional and geographical dislocation.
5237	1	a	Daldry coaches an astonishing performance from Bell.
5238	4	a	It's an easy film to critique for what it doesn't do, but what it does do very well is take you for a comically dark fantasy ride...
5239	4	a	How far can you follow the psychosexual exploits of folks you aren't all that drawn to in the first place?
5240	3	a	Among its deeper merits is that it proves a movie doesn't have to be mean to be fresh.
5241	3	a	I loved this movie as a kid. Haven't seen it since.
5242	5	a	...About as entertaining as avian flu.
5243	3	a	It's like a fine cover of a classic song - familiar yet refreshingly different.
5244	6	a	It seems less a remake than an alternate version.
5245	5	a	It's staggering to see the contortions a movie will go through to take a story about a non-white, non-American woman and make it about a white American guy.
5246	6	a	Yes, Button can be glorious, but the Hollywood glamour drowns the soul that it so needs. Plus, there is the insistent reminder that we will all lose our looks and die.
5247	3	a	A thoroughly entertaining film.
5248	4	a	Solid Jackie Chan. More stunts than martial arts, but still cool.
5249	3	a	Killer Joe is such a hideously over-the-top, black-hearted view of Southern-fried scumbags that even Texans like myself can't get offended. 
5250	3	a	A tough and realistic cop story that stays believable from beginning to end while delivering the truth about loyalty, courage and gut-wringing fear on an inner city military mission with no second chances.
5251	5	a	Although it has a delectable cast, Wonderland skims over its seedy characters to glamorize drug addiction and the role porn star John C. Holmes had in four murders.
5252	3	a	Hereafter is less concerned with the metaphysics of existence after we die -- contrasted with the CGI playground of The Lovely Bones -- than the earthly tribulations of people still alive who struggle to cope with the brush of Death's hand.
5253	4	a	Ofsted inspectors can expect nightmares; everyone else will be mildly amused.
5254	4	a	Tommy Lee Jones gives an uncompromisingly volcanic performance as the psychotic bigot, one of baseball greatest players, known for his aggressive conduct, racism, and sexism.
5255	3	a	Trainspotting is one of the most effective anti-drug movies I've seen in a long time. Its depiction of heroin addiction is so raw and gritty that you walk away with the realization that heroin is a drug not to be messed with.
5256	3	a	But for most of its running time, Hancock is a refreshing piece of cinema that should be another solid summer hit for Smith.
5257	6	a	It's not funny. It is occasionally witty, but not very often. It seems the filmmakers realized that as well as they fill the frequent dry spells with physical comedy that doesn't really fit the tone of the movie.
5258	3	a	"The Extra Man"" has its more outre moments but is in general an enjoyable, pitch-perfect celebration of non-conformity. Kevin Kline is a delight."
5259	4	a	I can accept [Huppert's] obsession, but not her love, which makes the movie come off significantly different than it was probably intended.
5260	2	a	Recommended, but twenty minutes could have been easily shorn off.
5261	2	a	Valkyrie it's a good film with more than enough there to keep your attention and for you to have come away feeling satisfied and informed.
5262	3	a	Crimson Peak is a lavish, refreshingly old-fashioned production.
5263	1	a	Much like the group it chronicles the movie never relents, never stops and, more importantly, never gives up. It keeps moving forward, forward, forward, refusing to back down or give in no matter what sort of hardship or tragedy pops up along the way.
5264	3	a	Aniston may not have received her much-touted Oscar nomination, but this brilliantly funny and often touching film should assure her a solid post-Friends career.
5265	4	a	Despite what the title suggests, it's the good old-fashioned virtues that make Breakin' All the Rules better than most romantic comedies.
5266	9	a	Larry Crowne may be the blandest, most white-bread rom-com in the history of the genre, instantly forgettable and more than a little embarrassing for its two superstar leads.
5267	4	a	Bullock and Grant are such masters of romantic comedy, they make falling in love with them, if not their characters, effortless, fun and rewarding.
5268	7	a	By turns risibly puerile and purely risible, the screenplay groans under the weight of its multiple platitudes.
5269	1	a	While Michael Collins does distort elements of history, most of the changes and compressions are dramatically effective.
5270	4	a	Graff ... stirs in some terrific moments along the way that subvert the genre just a little bit.
5271	4	a	A delightful cinematic trifle ... a lushly illustrated and sweetly told tale that is aimed squarely at the ten and under set.
5272	2	a	It's simple, it's adorable, and it works.
5273	3	a	This is a very funny movie, but its final moments give off a chilly unease.
5274	9	a	When the movie is not being obvious, it's being absurd. [Full review in Portuguese.]
5275	1	a	A movie so sweet, so open and honest that we savor its charm and bathe in its confidence.
5276	8	a	"Where so many Hollywood ""gay"" stories end on positive notes of rebirth and optimism, Guadagnino helms a love story unafraid to highlight the suffering one always contains."
5277	8	a	"It's not eat-your-ticket-stub bad, but ""The Lazarus Effect"" doesn't work at all, perhaps most successful at putting the audience to sleep. "
5278	4	a	Restraint proves a virtue of -- and a shrewd if necessary choice for -- Children of Invention, a modestly scaled, quietly effective independent movie about a struggling single mother and her two children.
5279	2	a	A film of zero substance that also happens to be good old fashioned slasher fun.
5280	3	a	This isn't a groundbreaking movie ... but its situations are so recognizable and universal that you don't need to be Greek to appreciate it.
5281	3	a	Ken Loach's most effective film since My Name Is Joe.
5282	2	a	Grotesque, stupid, pointless, and funny as hell.
5283	9	a	"Killer Joe"" offers us a sneering image of trailer-park Texas, in which everyone is stupid and amoral and trashier than their cluttered front yards."
5284	6	a	All the carefully orchestrated color schemes and all the dark corridors and secret chambers and all the flowing red metaphors in the world can't accelerate the slow patches, or make us care about lead characters.
5285	0	a	Peter Jackson creates a rich, haunting atmosphere, deftly juggling the eerily giddy fantasy world of the girls and their harsh, violent reality.
5286	0	a	[A] thoroughly engrossing portrayal of politics in its most rudimentary shape, it is also a rousing representation of the concept of democracy at its best and most potent.
5287	2	a	Not only does [Merhige] not provide any new insights with his vampiric filmmaking study, he gives us a one dimensional Murnau.
5288	8	a	Hale deserves credit for trying his best; a Chipmunks movie looks like a lonely place.
5289	5	a	Part documentary, part fictional romcom, and all twee.
5290	0	a	There has never been a better time for a woman-centric movie, especially one about a smart, angry woman.
5291	2	a	Killer Joe will leave many people in shock, confusion, and in need of a thorough shower by the time it's done.
5292	5	a	Proof that nice comedies about politics just don't work, especially during an election year.
5293	9	a	As it passed the two-hour mark, I began to fear the ending might never actually end. That it finally did was one of the movie's highlights. 
5294	2	a	Uneven yes, funny at times, yes, often uproariously so.
5295	5	a	The worst is saved for last: just when you think the movie has shown the courage of its 'gritty' convictions, it hits you with schmaltz that would shame a Hallmark card.
5296	7	a	The reason most movies don't include aliens, zombies, weird mysticism and a lot of swordfighting is that each of those elements... takes time to explore and nurture into something compelling.
5297	9	a	A cheap-looking quickie feature...the wasted talent on display somehow makes it all more painful. 
5298	6	a	Entertaining but Brown's life is glossed over to the point that he's barely more three dimensional than he was in the old Eddie Murphy SNL sketches. 
5299	4	a	The real reason for taking a chance on this minor summer confection would be to catch up on the life of an unbilled hero: Lloyd Dobler.
5300	5	a	Unpleasantly violent, often dull, and only intermittently sexy.
5301	3	a	A hipper, funnier, action-packed throwback to the original Star Wars.
5302	4	a	...the plot is too shifty, the conspiracy too exaggerated, and the ending too pat for sustained credibility.
5303	0	a	Rarely has a film more eloquently captured the universality of human experience.
5304	4	a	All in all it's a very pleasant way to spend the afternoon with a bunch of kids.
5305	4	a	The short shrift given to ... background considerations gives the film a shallowness.
5306	5	a	This should be a potent combination, but it turns out to be a fizzer.
5307	9	a	[...]they have about as much chemistry as John Hinckley and Jodie Foster
5308	4	a	"Though likable, its stock brand of comedy makes ""Meet The Parents"" look like a magnum opus of comic achievement by comparison."
5309	6	a	You, Me and Dupree has the feel of a film that could have gone in any number of directions, and perhaps at one time went in all of them.
5310	3	a	[A] rich, fun and fascinating film experience.
5311	2	a	Somehow, some way, Apatow has crafted that rarest of gems -- equal parts heart and crass.
5312	6	a	Mildly amusing...but joke repetition and a greater emphasis on outrageousness and vulgarity release a strong scent of the writers' desperation.
5313	3	a	The filmmakers take us on a gripping ride -- they just forgot to pack a parachute.
5314	3	a	It is, without a doubt, the most delirious movie to come out of a major studio in decades, perhaps ever.
5315	10	a	Love Ranch is less than two hours long, but it feels longer. Much longer -- as in long enough for the Rostovs to marry off Natasha and for Napoleon to retreat from Moscow.
5316	7	a	The victim of a tired genre
5317	6	a	There are so many characters basing their actions on what Jesus would do that Jesus just about deserves a co-screenwriting credit.
5318	4	a	Had there not been a Battlefield Earth I'd say this was the biggest turkey of the summer.
5319	6	a	Too clumsy in key moments ... to make a big splash.
5320	6	a	In attempting to update the novel, Disney filmmakers have dulled the characterizations and dialogue and given us instead a lovely series of picture postcards from outer space.
5321	4	a	Films based on video games have not set a very high bar in the past... The Angry Birds Movie is at least unlikely to ruffle your feathers or have you blowing up in anger.
5322	1	a	The simple beauty of the entire package is well summed up by Phedon Papamichael's beautiful black-and-white cinematography, which makes everything at once all the more modest yet majestic.
5323	4	a	Quirky British boarding-school comedy has iffy messages.
5324	2	a	Marred by implausibility, underdeveloped characters, and bad climax, technically Flightplan is great, taking full advantage of its confined space and restricted narrative time
5325	6	a	This is Ebiri's first feature after directing four shorts. He shows talent, but shouldn't give up his day job just yet.
5326	9	a	Verhoeven does not explore the dark side, but merely exploits it, and that makes all the difference in the world.
5327	8	a	The greatest title in history is, when executed as an actual movie, venomously awful.
5328	3	a	Starring Burt Lancaster and cast against type Hume Cronyn, Dassin's first foray into noir is one of the bleakest and most powerful crime prison melodramas ever made, an existential chronicle that also serves as an allegory of American society at large
5329	2	a	This is Ronan's show, and she finds extra intensity, beautifully layering Mary's steely edge with a joyous lightness.
5330	5	a	"Tom Hanks is killing time in ""Larry Crowne,"" an adult romance that is heartwarming, uplifting and monumentally dull."
5331	3	a	Well, the latest free-wheeling feminine-induced frenzy is presented in the form of filmmaker Malcolm D. Lee's infectiously bouncy and boisterous, soulful sisterhood romp Girls Trip.
5332	9	a	"Failure to Launch's"" unlikable lowlife leads are perfect for each other, considering that if they never met on Earth, they might someday cross paths in hell."
5333	0	a	These characters never surprise us with anything showy, lurid, or sensational. They're ordinary human beings, treated with fierce attention that feels like deep respect. 
5334	3	a	...a better-than-average slice-of-life kitchen-sink drama that benefits substantially from Compston's star-making performance.
5335	0	a	Judd shines like the movie star she was destined to become.
5336	4	a	The overall effect is still striking and often unexpected, with an impact that grows and lingers long after the final, abrupt shot.
5337	1	a	You want to be scared and have a few laughs and not have your intelligence insulted? Here you go.
5338	8	a	This film is every man's wet dream. What woman wouldn't want to have a one night stand with a drunken, fat, vulgar, irresponsible, dirty looking slob?
5339	0	a	No Country is not a film for weak, unsteady hearts.
5340	5	a	At its simplest form, this is highfalutin hokum.
5341	8	a	A loud, crude, dreary misfire that feels like it was cobbled together from material cut from other lousy comedies.
5342	3	a	An overload of non-stop, gravity-defying action sequences.
5343	6	a	This toothless romantic comedy is sweet and it has its moments, but its demands on suspension of disbelief eventually crush it.
5344	5	a	Overhyped family movie covered in a cellophane shrink-wrap of corporate Disney plastic-ness.
5345	6	a	Its potential as a spicy spoof of Hollywood's incestuous relation with the entertainment press has been Ephroned away in favor of bland romantic comedy.
5346	4	a	All of the ideas and themes it puts forth are fascinating and could be quite enlightening for the modern age, if the film they were attached to was even a tiny bit fun to watch.
5347	1	a	A poisoned candy apple that'll bring a sardonic smile to the lips of those who remember it and entertain those who haven't experienced it before.
5348	1	a	The mystery is absorbing, but it is the depth of characters and richness of the relationships that makes this movie so effective. Fifteen minutes in, I was a marshmallow.
5349	4	a	A cold fish of a film, beautiful but taxing.
5350	1	a	No report I have seen takes us so disturbingly inside the mind of the abuser as Amy Berg's Deliver Us From Evil.
5351	4	a	Slavin's film has all the trademarks of Miller's plays: the humorless solemnity, the affected poetry-of-the-common-man dialogue, the liberal conscience sputtering with indignation, shocked - shocked - at the idea of man's inhumanity to man.
5352	1	a	'...director Steven Spielberg has brought the story to this generation. And it is a story meant for this time.'
5353	2	a	An appealing piece of fluff for movie buffs, and sometimes that's just good enough. 
5354	6	a	The simplicity of an implacable alien hunter tracking down its human prey gets lost under a whole lot of noisy chatter and incoherent action movie nonsense.
5355	1	a	Woody Allen sketches out a roundelay that tackles with warmth and a playful intelligence the gulf between heart and head in matters of nostalgia and love.
5356	0	a	Total Recall's caricaturing of Schwarzenegger, its flip ribbing at his stocks of action-hero cache, signal the deep, almost atomic level at which its satire functions. 
5357	9	a	Death by sequel. Extremely violent sequel.
5358	4	a	Hanks fans will revel in their hero's hour in this innocuous tale that's well intentioned for all its mediocre happenings and foreseeable ending.
5359	3	a	Despite a nagging sensation about its shortcomings, the acting and the atmospherics continue to haunt me.
5360	3	a	This one does for the series what The Wrath of Khan did for Star Trek.
5361	1	a	It's the sight of a filmmaker rediscovering the power their voice has - and using it as a cry for help that we are now too powerless to answer.
5362	3	a	Thanks to Hepburn's performance we can feel how this woman's past romantic disappointments have made a passionate affair seem so simultaneously appealing and frightening.
5363	6	a	The revelation of a gruesome back story seems, often, to serve as much for laughs as for dramatic heft in what is one of Almodovar's lighter efforts.
5364	3	a	The Artist plays around with the distinction between silent and sound cinema, resulting in the superficial entertainment value of a high concept film school joke. But it's a charming and supremely gorgeous joke.
5365	5	a	You may be able to ignore [its]flaws yet as the cinematic equivalent of an ice cream sundae with far too many ingredients, you may end up feeling a bit queasy afterwards.
5366	6	a	For audiences that loved Meet the Parents, the movie is a welcome chance to revisit funny and familiar characters.
5367	8	a	A film of dazzling style and gentle triumph.
5368	0	a	One of the purest and simplest examples ever of a director falling in love with her star's gifts.
5369	3	a	To Singer's credit, the film is remarkably suspenseful, even though we know pretty much how it will end.
5370	5	a	"Step Up: All In"" is so divorced from anything resembling reality that it is astonishing to behold. The best advice, though, would be to avoid beholding it."
5371	4	a	More charming and sweetly calibrated than one might expect... It's a welcome change of pace from Roth, who shows a dimensionality previously undetected.
5372	9	a	Its humor tires not too long after the beginning credits have finished rolling.
5373	5	a	As good as a couple of its action beats are, Max still suffers from the heartlessness that makes games emotionally inferior to movies. Nobody ever shed a tear over a video-game character's death.
5374	6	a	More than half an hour shorter than The Lost World, so at least there's a lot less of it to suffer through.
5375	6	a	These are truly tedious stakes for an action movie. The franchise isn't worried about world safety. It's fretting over whether to start wearing Depends.
5376	1	a	"It is immediately apparent that ""Love, Simon"" is long overdue."
5377	4	a	Young pet lovers will get a kick out of dog comedy.
5378	0	a	"How much does chance play in our clashes with evil? If that's too philosophical for you, then, pardner, you'd best turn to entertainment other than ""No Country for Old Men,"" arguably the best yet from the Coen brothers. Adult, sophisticated, and often amb"
5379	9	a	A swift blow to the head would be less painful than sitting through this again.
5380	2	a	a unique film unlike anything else you'll see from this era
5381	5	a	Occasionally veers so far into absurdity that it manages to make its central character - capable, smart, working mom Kate Reddy - look like a nitwit.
5382	5	a	Eat Pray Love will be an intense spiritual experience for many who see it - they will end up on their knees, praying for its merciful end.
5383	0	a	[A]ll the more gripping for being written, directed and acted with such scrupulous restraint.
5384	3	a	Wonderful performances by Amy Adams and James Marsden as the real-life versions of a classic Disney princess and her prince charming. They are magnificent.
5385	3	a	Made with fluid skill and a passion for storytelling, its tale of how the Vietnam War and American society affect a black Marine remains accessible while confounding expectations.
5386	2	a	Even the film's title -- which is never explained -- seems a celebration of the vibrancy and sensuality of life. But, as the film also points out, the celebration is often tinged with regret and recrimination.
5387	6	a	Despite screenwriter Steven Knight's pedigree of grippingly good thrillers, this historical western becomes a very long walk too quickly for its own good.
5388	4	a	There's a certain knee-jerk impulse to bash Snakes, just because of all the ridiculous buildup, but the film delivers on its promise of reptilian fun, with a camp mix of comedy, horror and suspense.
5389	5	a	Outstanding performances help this provocative British drama seem to tally up to something that is greater than its individual parts. But parts alone do not a solid movie make.
5390	1	a	A love story of sublime subtlety where the smallest encounters have the most consuming impact.
5391	3	a	It sounded like the dumbest movie of all time, but it's actually smart, subversive and packed with famous voices saying wonderfully unspeakable things. In fact, it's a banger.
5392	0	a	It's an absorbing, even thrilling head trip.
5393	3	a	Roberts is the obvious focus here, but she's enough of a pro to get out of the way and let a scene be stolen.
5394	4	a	While the storyline is not the most original, this film still gives a few good scares. 
5395	5	a	There's an improvisatory air, overlaid with quirky charm but never any bite. Hoffman's performance needs tougher, more focused direction.
5396	3	a	A ragged, crusty old sock of a film, it has you rolling your eyes, shaking your head, gawking and giggling in all the right moments. And all the right moments are so, so wrong.
5397	5	a	The Bridesmaids-style bawdiness is still there but the characters haven't developed or grown up in the slightest.
5398	3	a	For its occasional moments of excess and unhurried pace, An Unexpected Journey is proof that Jackson still has a knack for stories in this world.
5399	0	a	The film is as lean and mean as a barbed-wire necktie, darkly funny and much deeper than the average crime thriller.
5400	3	a	Essential viewing for anyone with an interest in the genre, or who wants to see Pam Grier at her very best.
5401	4	a	It's very apparent that Roth is having a blast bringing this world to life and making a scary movie without being able to rely on his splatstick shtick. This is a movie that has a lot of fun being a movie
5402	4	a	Audience members willing to hop aboard this emotional roller coaster ride will respond to the resultant pathos far better than viewers wondering why the laughs suddenly went MIA.
5403	5	a	Too dumb for adults, too bad-habit-inducing for children.
5404	1	a	A movie drunk on fantasy and high on life, Spy Kids comes on the screen blazing and never lets up.
5405	1	a	So filled with extraordinary performances that you hardly know where to start in discussing it ... Penn, Robbins, Harden and Eastwood all deserve Oscar nominations.
5406	2	a	Ignore logic, and the flick has plenty of grungy fantasy appeal.
5407	2	a	With its vibrant look, frisky attitude and sweet lesson about loyalty and friendship, Bolt is solid, fresh family-friendly entertainment.
5408	6	a	The result feels manipulative and superficial.
5409	1	a	The Soloist is pitch-perfect, a sensitive rendering of challenging social and emotional themes.
5410	9	a	I'm sitting here shakey of hand and bulgey of eye, trying to convey just how pitiful this film is. Yet no words I can think of do justice to this dross. It is just awful.
5411	6	a	Yi's overgrown geek girl shines, but tellingly, none of her best scenes have anything to do with holding hands with Cera,
5412	2	a	A few more animal encounters and fewer grief sessions would have been nice, but it's still a solid family film.
5413	10	a	Releasing a film with the word 'dog' in its title in January lends itself to easy jokes and insults, and Snow Dogs deserves every single one of them.
5414	7	a	Seyfried is delightful in this movie whereas I have found her just annoying in others. Maybe it is that she gets to share the screen with Bernal and the luminous Vanessa. Those two could make anybody look good. Still Seyfried is also good in her scenes wi
5415	3	a	Great, fun caper flick with an amazing ensemble cast.
5416	6	a	Road-tripping romance that features a talented cast and gorgeous locales but an overly sappy plot and nap-inducing pace.
5417	4	a	Couples Retreat is a pleasant, undemanding, middle-of-the-road comedy, and really, were you expecting anything else?
5418	2	a	It probably shouldn't be the way in which high-school kids learn about Henry VIII and his court, but it's a fun movie.
5419	5	a	It is ironic that, of all Almodovar's films, Broken Embraces is the biggest budget and the greatest length, yet it is also the dullest. His devoted fans will be delighted, but those who enjoyed Volver will be disappointed.
5420	9	a	Silly nonsense.
5421	2	a	The type of crazed, folkloric epic that Germany's own De Niro-Scorsese duo usually excelled at.
5422	4	a	Silent Hill renders the look and feel of the game with perfect clarity... But it's this unwavering fidelity to the source material that is also the film's biggest problem.
5423	6	a	A sequel that ultimately falls right in line with its lackluster predecessor...
5424	5	a	Floundering, only intermittently funny. Wait for the dvd.
5425	3	a	"While Wells's ice-blue color scheme borrows from both ""Tron"" films and a litany of ""Star Trek"" episodes, a majestic musical score by the great composer John Powell somehow makes everything old feel fresh and wondrous again."
5426	2	a	Hitchcock is more lighthearted and humorous in comparison to Psycho. Thanks to that and a really talented cast, Hitchcock is incredibly charming, funny, and intriguing. 
5427	3	a	"Endearing eccentricities, such as Toula's father's improvisational Greek etymologies of words like ""kimono"" and his reliance on Windex for a range of external-use medicinal purposes, help humanize the characters."
5428	1	a	For the most part, the Rocky pictures have been outstanding entertainments, beautifully crafted and executed, and Rocky V is an important and worthwhile addition to the series.
5429	0	a	This is visceral film-making at its finest, painted on the grandest of canvases, and yet, one which maintains the finest eye for detail.
5430	3	a	Sure, this should be straight-to-video Disney, but it's still charming, harmless fun.
5431	5	a	A dry, forensic account, more suitable for a true-crime show on late-night cable.
5432	3	a	While it doesn't pack the emotional heft of director Pedro Almodvar's most moving films, such as Volver, it is stylish and arresting, with powerful performances and a compelling, if at times contrived, story.
5433	2	a	A gorgeously shot and smartly written outdoors adventure.
5434	0	a	Billy Elliot earns every one of its sentiments and emotions without getting overly manipulative or preachy
5435	3	a	Murray is outstanding as the bearer of flawed maturity and gnawing melancholy.
5436	2	a	"It pains me to say this, but, believe the hype. Once it gets going, ""Snakes On A Plane,"" is a pure rush of fun and ""oh my god, I can't believe they did that,"" moments."
5437	1	a	You won't forget it soon, though it may give you at least some qualms about using the subway, especially if you're ever in Budapest.
5438	3	a	...a tale of redemption hard-won, and all the more rewarding for that.
5439	4	a	It's difficult to muster the will to get behind these fools, and yet there are stretches where Westfeldt's script glows, such as an expertly executed dinner-table fracas, which manages to engage the entire ensemble.
5440	1	a	A harrowing, haunting dive into the mind of a female serial killer.
5441	5	a	I expected stupid humor, silly humor, or bizarre humor, but not no humor.
5442	6	a	If you can forgive the story for being what it is, as I could not, you will probably get your money's worth out of this film. When will they ever learn?
5443	4	a	despite [a] muddled attempt at some kind of existential relevance, I Heart Huckabees works on an absurdist comedy level
5444	5	a	A distraction that steals Lee's concentration, leaving the film in the same condition as the real Woodstock: muddy, scattered, and overlong.
5445	5	a	The sight of Black burning down an entire admin block during a moment of passion would warm up any winter.
5446	7	a	Of the twelve shorts, there's really only three that are good and a few that are passable. The other half are uninteresting, poor, and at times, incredibly painful to watch.
5447	0	a	How, exactly, was this film overlooked?
5448	0	a	Haynes is a master for period pieces - the movie nicely re-creates Eisenhower-era New York - and his skill with actresses.
5449	4	a	Some people really love goofy comedy, and for those people there's Paul Blart: Mall Cop. You can bring the kids.
5450	0	a	Cumberbatch bristles with brilliance in this handsome biopics the British do so well about the fascinating, tragic story of mathematician Alan Turing.
5451	0	a	"Grand Performances move ""Hustle"
5452	3	a	[Creates] a disturbing mood further fueled by the picture's underlying themes.
5453	5	a	An uninspired, recycled action thriller.
5454	4	a	"There's an algorithm for making an Oscar-ready prestige picture - and ""The Imitation Game"" follows it obsessively."
5455	5	a	Eckhart and Otto are Olympic weightlifters of the acting profession, clean-and-jerking half-ton lines, keeping straight faces, nearly prolapsing their thespian intestines.
5456	4	a	[Inherent Vice] takes its own sweet time to get places. And sometimes you might wonder if we actually needed to go to all of those places in the first place.
5457	3	a	Wright and Pegg's rickety and ridiculous mash-up of narrative elements is actually a sophisticated attempt to grapple with real emotions and ideas.
5458	0	a	You weep, laugh, celebrate and mourn with the characters throughout the six hours, which at once seem like an eternity and an instant.
5459	9	a	The film that not only made me give up on Brian DePalma -- the man can't make a good movie anymore -- but it also made me doubt the judgement of Nicolas Cage and Gary Sinise.
5460	1	a	Whatever your opinion regarding intellectual property, I'm sure you'll agree we're fortunate that the movie survived, even in its various contested and truncated forms.
5461	3	a	Sweet, funny, touching, and contemporary.
5462	5	a	The shot of Blart quietly crawling into a hostage situation inside the mall's bank and walking through a roped line is a moment of absurd grace, only it's shot with the vulgarity of a Crash Test Dummies commercial.
5463	5	a	A charming, spirited movie for cinephiles, or those who aspire to be.
5464	0	a	One of the most remarkable films of the year.
5465	4	a	Superficially very charming, this lacks depth but is still a pleasant and moving distraction.
5466	4	a	For Edgar Wright/Simon Pegg/Nick Frost fans, I suppose this silly, stylized, slapstick British romp is a ridiculously amusing, apocalyptic riff.
5467	6	a	This is one flight that never quite gets off the ground.
5468	9	a	Imagine The Constant Gardener after a frontal lobotomy, and that's basically Max Payne in a nutshell.
5469	4	a	After many meticulously drawn connections, it's a disappointment to see most of our two-plus hours of careful attention thrown away.
5470	4	a	Moviegoers don't like surprises in their romantic comedies, and this one plays it particularly safe.
5471	2	a	"Cameron Crowe's ""We Bought a Zoo"" is an undeniably manipulative crowd-pleaser but there's something about being manipulated in such an expert manner that makes the tugging on the heartstrings easier to take."
5472	3	a	A neurotically charged post-millennial take on the trailer-park comedies that Jonathan Demme once claimed for himself.
5473	3	a	Mangold's script was interesting enough to draw enormous stars willing to work their buns off for scale.
5474	6	a	Too many sequences feel generic, from the unexamined privilege that serves as the movie's cultural backdrop to the now-requisite scene of a man changing a diaper while covered in baby poop.
5475	4	a	Eastwood and Morgan skillfully and slowly unveil each character's struggles and then send them on their way to inevitable encounters with one another.
5476	1	a	Remains a potent statement about the horrors of war and a valid testament to the girl who could answer them by writing, 'I still believe, in spite of everything, that people are really good at heart.' [Blu-ray]
5477	3	a	The cast does its job, but the overly familiar screenplay is a problem.
5478	1	a	The Prestige takes its title literally, asking us to believe in the power that stature and esteem has over two dark, desperate men, to witness how far both will go to achieve it...and more importantly, prevent it from happening for the other.
5479	4	a	An awkward mix of plodding history and general adequacy, with occasional flourishes of visual panache that seem to be from some other, more stylish movie.
5480	4	a	Retains the gentle, low-key appeal of his books and TV series.
5481	3	a	Moore's performance as an early onset Alzheimer's patient is arguably her best. And, that takes into account four earlier Oscar nominations. She is due.
5482	9	a	Abysmal comedy that's nonsensical, frequently offensive and almost entirely laugh-free.
5483	4	a	The digital comedy-adventure starts out pretty slow and never really finds its footing, especially in regards to its needed comic edge.
5484	9	a	More-or-less abhorrent swill; vapid, painful and moronic in the way it treats its audience.
5485	0	a	It shouldn't work - there's just too much going on. But it does. Spectacularly. Go see it.
5486	3	a	good entertainment
5487	6	a	An interesting but often frustrating effort by the director of The Sea Inside, who proves that ambition and talent aren't enough to ensure a compelling drama.
5488	1	a	"Transgressive beyond anything the iconic Spanish filmmaker has ever made, it's a ""mad-scientist"" tale with a twist -- one so disturbingly clever, it should be illegal to reveal."
5489	6	a	A high-concept premise too-tidily comments on its underlying subject matter in The Joneses.
5490	2	a	Bateman and McCarthy elevate the material to a higher level than it should have.
5491	6	a	That's the hypocrisy that tears this fascinating film apart: The female sexual urge must be broken, but the male sexual urge can be celebrated in song.
5492	6	a	Old-hat tropes under a superficially stunning veneer.
5493	3	a	Ponders a cold case indicting a former U.S. senator: why did Ted Kennedy wait nine hours before reporting that car accident?
5494	6	a	With one possible exception, none of its women is at all likable.
5495	7	a	This clamorous offering fails to elicit either laughs or much in the way of sympathy.
5496	5	a	Amid the bungles, Collins is a bright spark.
5497	0	a	The documentary style allows Spielberg to deliver his message without preaching. The clever use of light and shade also makes it visually stunning.
5498	9	a	Now I know how Bill Murray felt in Groundhog Day.
5499	2	a	Two Weeks Notice has appeal beyond being a Sandra Bullock vehicle or a standard romantic comedy.
5500	6	a	Films set in different countries can teach us so much about other cultures. For example, did you know that Memoirs of a Geisha is Japanese for 'Sominex'? 
5501	3	a	Beautifully shot and superbly written, the latest film from Alexander Payne is an engaging, bittersweet drama with a terrific central performance from Bruce Dern that merits some awards attention.
5502	2	a	A powerful film, and Theron's performance is as spectacular as advertised.
5503	3	a	Cruise and Fanning give Oscar-caliber performances. The special effects are mind-boggling. This is a thoroughly enjoyable film if you forget the silly Hollywood ending. 
5504	3	a	Part of why the performances work so effectively is that Heineman uses his documentary sensibilities to capture them with sensory context above dialogue alone. 
5505	4	a	A fairly uneven collection of short horror stories. The segment with James Woods, however, justifies the price of a rental
5506	3	a	...an engaging and thoroughly innovative spin on the superhero genre...
5507	3	a	It's not that this is a bad, blackly comic slice-of-lowlife: It's just that you've just seen it all before.
5508	2	a	You've seen this kind of situation before, but Owen Wilson gets the warhorse new life.
5509	0	a	Expect sweaty palms as the pressure mounts, since your apprehension skyrockets when watching monsters who'd murder at the drop of a hat.
5510	1	a	"Still dazzling, and the movie Ron Howard's ""Rush"" is sure to be measured against. "
5511	3	a	The deeper they look into this tragedy, the more it makes you feel.
5512	6	a	"Hancock"" is a mess of a movie, a bizarre combination, believe it or not, of ""My Super Ex-Girlfriend"" and ""Breaking the Waves."
5513	3	a	A magical movie the entire family can enjoy.
5514	2	a	Inspirational albeit conventional sports film from Clint Eastwood, with terrific work from Morgan Freeman and Matt Damon.
5515	6	a	The relentless torrent of foul language--and not just from Jay--becomes numbing and finally makes the film seem more crass than amusing.
5516	6	a	A mediocre tale of wilderness survival.
5517	4	a	"Slasher fans, take a whack at ""Wrong Turn."
5518	5	a	Whether it's the director's fault or the result of studio meddling, this is a mess of a movie that's been cut to pieces.
5519	6	a	Despite all involved, Mystic River never quite equals the sum of its parts.
5520	3	a	Although It Comes at Night isn't quite as striking or as intelligent as it wants to be, it's enjoyable and there are definitely a few scenes that will keep creeping you out until late into the night.
5521	4	a	Might not be the most original and novel way to convert a game and its characters into a movie, but it can be funny most of the time.
5522	4	a	Does the excellence of the second part make up for the rancid, unintentionally campy opening? Not for me, though perhaps others would be more forgiving.
5523	6	a	Murray, idiosyncratic as always, dominates, but his performance can't save this misconceived mess.
5524	2	a	Silent Hill is groundbreaking, at least in being the first such film of any cinematic merit whatsoever.
5525	4	a	It might not all flow, but between Winslet and castmate Judy Davis's various spitfire moments and some potent dark turns, there's a fair amount to like.
5526	9	a	Hardcore Prince fans might revel in His Royal Purpleness' muted philisopical musings, but everyone else will likely find this film an overblown bore.
5527	4	a	There's no deep message. No complex characters. No moments of high drama, no inspired speeches. But the pictures are pretty, the story is sweet and it's told by a top-notch team of Hollywood pros. It's not great; but it sure is likable.
5528	7	a	"I guess ""Commonplace Four"" or ""Tedious Four"" didn't have the same ring to it."
5529	6	a	How do you know if a romantic comedy isn't working? Generally if it's neither especially romantic, nor particularly comic. And in this picture, no matter how many times he keeps coming up to bat, Brooks keeps striking out.
5530	5	a	No real suspense, and no payoff except for a groan-inducing, look-out-here-comes-the-sequel ending.
5531	4	a	A persistent kowtowing to corporate interests flattens the satire. More logos will fly at punters during the film than they are likely to encounter in the preceding commercials.
5532	7	a	It might as well be the crappy pilot for a Jurassic Park TV series or a feature version of Sid and Marty Krofft's Land of the Lost.
5533	1	a	Who knew that a story about plagiarism would be so genuinely frightening?
5534	5	a	There's an audience for such lazy sentimentality, which means Crowe's half-hearted attempt to revive his career might actually succeed.
5535	3	a	"Although snubbed by the Oscar machine, ""The Skin I Live In"" is a solid drama-thriller that offers the best contemporary take on the Frankenstein tale that I've seen in a long while."
5536	8	a	...takes an upper-tier cast, a fascinating piece of historical drama, and truly burgeoning filmmaking talent in director Josie Rourke, and manages to bring the best out in all of them.
5537	6	a	Another over hyped Sophia Loren film that fizzles more than it sizzles.
5538	6	a	Well, what did anyone expect Daddy Day Camp to be?
5539	8	a	Everything about this amateurishly made unpleasant gross-out comedy stinks and is degrading.
5540	3	a	Not only is this a rollicking cartoon joy ride for all the little Olivias and Spencers in your life -- it's a solid film in its own right.
5541	5	a	"The opening shopping cart scene announces that The Roman Circus Has Arrived. ""Jackass"" is the sort of spectacle of exquisite sadism that would do Nero proud."
5542	3	a	Simply put, if you liked Sorcerer's Stone, you'll like Chamber Of Secrets.
5543	3	a	"By the time Fey is able to say the words, ""This is not about you,"" the comedy owns the feminism it always had. The war scenes are only so-so, but it wins a bigger battle."
5544	2	a	Charming and sweet, wrapping a leash around your heart.
5545	6	a	As a vanity project, the film is more tolerable than Purple Rain but it's every bit as obvious and redundant.
5546	5	a	That these men are brave beyond measure and saved countless lives is in no doubt but, with its focus on the dullest of details, lack of psychological insight and bizarre shifts in tone, it's a bewildering folly indeed.
5547	4	a	Autumn in New York is saddled with a sappy, silly script.
5548	3	a	Bruce Dern's towering performance anchors this story set in what urban hipsters call flyover country.
5549	5	a	It's fascinating, tense and grisly... but a bit of a muddle really.
5550	6	a	Bee Movie has a few charming moments and a scene or two with legitimate hilarity, but mostly it's just mediocre.
5551	2	a	One fee-yucked up movie.
5552	4	a	Dutton is one of my favorite actors, but as a director he reveals an unwelcome penchant for soapy hysterics.
5553	4	a	The best thing the movie has going for it is Chadwick Boseman's live-wire channeling of Brown.
5554	2	a	Jason Bateman and Melissa McCarthy make a terrific comedy team in this road trip romp.
5555	9	a	Dull, slow paced horror about vampire bats is forgettable.
5556	7	a	It's a Hollywood movie, not a good movie.
5557	0	a	Lessons learned: Never underestimate the creativity of a wronged West Virginian with access to barbed wire.
5558	4	a	The cast is strong and the first act has an intriguingly dreamy quality, but it gives way to a soggy ending.
5559	2	a	humble, subtle and restrained
5560	6	a	Christopher Nolan's The Prestige revisits some of the same themes -- questioning appearances, reality and perceptions -- as the director's previous Memento but with less satisfying results.
5561	4	a	Sadly Wonderland slips and clucks through its own artful delivery ultimately creating nothing more then a kinetic mess of a film with glimpses of genius
5562	4	a	"In general, ""Alvin"" is funny and, sometimes, a little bit sweet."
5563	0	a	Even in the moment of watching it, Inherent Vice, feels like a half-remembered dream.
5564	3	a	Annette Bening makes this story of Gloria Grahame's last days a must-see.
5565	5	a	Despite a potentially decent premise, this is a disappointing romance, let down by terrible dialogue, poor plotting, severe miscasting, a charisma-free performance from Christopher Egan and a total lack of chemistry between its two leads.
5566	2	a	Despite cringing at many of Betty's deluded interactions with the residents of her final destination and the director's seeming lack of faith in the believability of many of the scenes, Nurse Betty still turns out to be entertaining.
5567	6	a	Along with a plodding script, the key character knows what he wants but takes no bold steps to get it. Even Damon appears confused in the movie.
5568	3	a	...more whimsical and charming than you would ever expect from a picture about suicide.
5569	3	a	A slightly overwrought tale is made digestible by the mesmeric cinematography of Adam Arkapaw and the intense chemistry of the central double act.
5570	4	a	The film foregrounds the absurdity of sexism while still using the same slapstick style of the first film. Sometimes it works, sometimes not. But, the attempt is refreshing.
5571	4	a	If it doesn't exactly kick out the jams, it does move them around a little bit.
5572	3	a	A delightful exercise in wish-fulfillment, the picture is one of the most unashamedly romantic of Allen's career - if not the most - with hardly a trace of his cynical, caustic and darkly ironic take on the world.
5573	8	a	...a hugely effective heist film that masquerades as a teen drama.
5574	3	a	Excellent comedy. Really plays the soap opera and magic typewriter gimmicks to the fullest.
5575	3	a	House of Flying Daggers is a bewitching work of art that succeeds as a sense-luscious drama, an amazing martial arts film and a romantic love story that touches the heart.
5576	4	a	In the end, we were bored. In the end, it all seemed pretty trite.
5577	1	a	A tender and heartbreakingly lovely story of risk and sacrifice in the shadow of the terror.
5578	4	a	Ernest's best film. Actually quite funny.
5579	3	a	It operates as a multi-pronged critique of a society in which the media, the police, the state and public itself are implicated in precisely the kind of violence that gripped the nation of Brazil that day.
5580	9	a	Here's to hoping that the pint-sized thespians who play those kids -- barely blessed with names, let alone personalities -- don't mistake the lame lessons of the adults around them on the set of Daddy Day Camp as a master class in comedic acting.
5581	8	a	An unfunny comedy with a limited imagination and a steady diet of fat jokes.
5582	3	a	Writer-director Joss Whedon resurrects a TV series one network canceled and no other wanted with sass and style.
5583	3	a	Moments which draw on innocent charm are prevalent.
5584	1	a	I'm not saying that Diary of a Wimpy Kid is going to be the grade school equivalent of the Twilight movies, but it is a film for those who enjoy the source material.
5585	4	a	Not a major Eastwood film, but undeniably stirring.
5586	0	a	"If you loved ""Hero"" and ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon,"" then you'll also enjoy the gorgeous ""House of Flying Daggers."
5587	0	a	Carol is essential. It's the work of a premiere filmmaker whose talents only continue to grow.
5588	7	a	The episodic L'auberge Espangnole is like a younger and European version of Friends.
5589	6	a	The formula was starting to become tiresome by now. And can somebody please explain how Rocky suddenly became more articulate in this one despite more punches to the head?
5590	4	a	n the end, The Imitation Game ably details a little-known corner of the WWII story, one that has incredible relevance today. 
5591	5	a	... more of a gothic horror movie than an arresting biographical drama.
5592	0	a	Most of the films of Luis Bunuel are comedies in one way or another, but he doesn't go for gags and punch lines; his comedy is more like a dig in the ribs, sly and painful.
5593	9	a	When a film is as unintentionally corny as this one, it's anyone's guess as to how many viewers can stomach all the schmaltz for the positive message at the end.
5594	6	a	Like real-life treasure hunting, there are far worse pursuits than Into the Blue.
5595	0	a	You'll fall in love with it. It's not just Nolan's best film; it's one of the best of the year.
5596	2	a	Secondhand Lions is too great a film to be completely destroyed by the fading abilities of an awkward man-child.
5597	0	a	You may have seen Middle Earth before. But you haven't been IN Middle Earth.Peter Jackson's 'The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey' has made it possible for you to feel like you're surrounded by the astonishing environment created by J.R.R. Tolkien.
5598	5	a	The twisty storyline does have its moments, but eventually the actors are reduced to wearing the requirements of the plot like pairs of cement shoes.
5599	5	a	Betrays a lack of cinematic judgment that's frankly astonishing, from a group of very accomplished filmmakers and performers. It's Scorsese Karaoke. 
5600	1	a	In a time of year we don't ordinarily great films, this one comes very, very close.
5601	5	a	Elitism aside, the sheer monotony of almost every poor person being evil really bogs down the narrative.
5602	6	a	This is nothing more than dumb fun, with the scales strongly tipped towards dumb.
5603	2	a	James White is at times so bleak and bracing that many will find it tough to endure.
5604	5	a	The film doesn't present the edge of seventeen so much as its annoyingly grating surface.
5605	6	a	What I'm hoping flies under the radar is the unexpected and disappointing transformation of Kasi Lemmons, whose previous pitch-black, haunted sensibility barely makes an appearance in her highest-profile film.
5606	4	a	Depp's likable turn as the bewildered Frank, not having a clue over what is happening, provides an everyman type who falls for a spy.
5607	1	a	It's a genuine pleasure to find a movie with such a deep and intelligent portrayal of simple human lives, with all their minor triumphs and tragedies.
5608	0	a	This is it -- this is James Bond in all of his glory -- in what easily ranks up there with the best Bond films of them all.
5609	6	a	The writing shows occasional wit and the performances are charming enough, but there is too much working against them.
5610	0	a	The film crackles with the energy of Bob and Charlotte's connection, and their adventures in the hurry-and-flurry Tokyo nightlife are glittery, dreamlike, meditative and beautiful.
5611	9	a	Just rent the darned Breakfast Club instead of slogging through this sludge.
5612	5	a	Each [story] is so thinly plotted and devoid of any real emotion that it's no wonder they had to string three of them together to make a complete film.
5613	3	a	Slowly paced but worthwhile film.
5614	3	a	Charming entry-level spookiness and nicely old-fashioned eeriness for budding fright fans. A disarmingly goofy Jack Black and a vamping-it-up Cate Blanchett meet in a comic middle that is perfectly pitched.
5615	0	a	The movie is based on short stories by Raymond Carver, but this is Altman's work, not Carver's, and all the film really has in common with its source is a feeling for people who are disconnected.
5616	5	a	This toothless political comedy fumbles its various opportunities to deflate the pomposity of politicians.
5617	0	a	This is Hawke's best performance to date and a film that is at the top of my list of the year.
5618	5	a	A possible cult hit, it's too self-indulgent to find a mass audience.
5619	5	a	The old St Trinian's movies with Alistair Sim weren't exactly comedy classics, but they look like gold next to this feeble, sloppily written caper.
5620	4	a	A little charmless and not particularly funny. The recycling message is also woefully heavy-handed.
5621	0	a	The dangers of filmmakers trying to replicate a golden era rather than embrace the present are part and parcel of Inherent Vice, but the ramifications are political as well. 
5622	5	a	I'm not so sure Berg is losing faith that his audience can follow along...but in the face of so many comic book films entering theatres, it seems a poor choice to differentiate yours by way of tacky TV-level antics.
5623	0	a	One of Sam Peckinpah's finest films, a relentless study in violence and machismo that is shocking, not only for its explicit gore, but for the degree to which it manipulates 'civilized' audiences.
5624	5	a	It's hard to believe that Bill Murray can be annoying.
5625	1	a	What could have been a brilliant film experience, expanding on the stage version as only film can, ends up instead as a series of wonderful bits and pieces.
5626	7	a	For a movie funded by an NPR personality, it also has a nasty anti-environmentalist streak.
5627	4	a	The one thing that could kill the phenomenon that is 'Snakes on a Plane' has arrived: 'Snakes on a Plane.' 
5628	5	a	Great stars can't rescue uneven, sometimes violent comedy.
5629	2	a	A whodunnit with a deeply emotional core, thanks to L.A. Confidential scripter Brian Helgeland's richly crafted, textured screenplay and the superb ensemble cast's outstanding individual performances and collective chemistry.
5630	3	a	Christianity and paganism clash in Ken Russell's campy The Lair of the White Worm.
5631	9	a	Maybe Dublin collectively dissociated itself from the project. Who'd blame it? 
5632	5	a	It could have added up to something. Alas, any excitement is submerged by the relentless barrage of trite sci-fi allusions and nudge-nudge gags aimed solely at adults.
5633	1	a	McDonagh's livewire screenplay and true direction make the pic a must-see; two Oscar-worthy performances from Frances McDormand and Sam Rockwell rocket it into the heavens.
5634	4	a	It's certainly no political classic, but it's worth at least a couple of electoral votes.
5635	4	a	...about as old-fashioned a cowboy picture as one could imagine, but it moves along quickly enough, and it adds a touch of mystery and romance to the usual fights and chases.
5636	9	a	Suggests a particularly wretched episode of Star Trek tricked out with fancy fireworks and weighed down with a score that grinds away like a cement mixer.
5637	6	a	Becomes little more than a typical--if highly atmospheric--slasher film, complete with the cheesy dialogue and gimmicky conclusion.
5638	9	a	A good/bad way of seeing Bill Murray at its worst. It's him indulging in his laziest and most clueless tendencies, among them ignoring an obviously sloppy and dumb script that teems in Ugly Americanisms. 
5639	3	a	In a year already graced with a glorious over-supply of great films, American Hustle arguably contains the best performance package of the lot.
5640	3	a	Full of the kind of surprises, twists and cruel irony that have fueled many a Hollywood thriller.
5641	8	a	The whole movie is a game of one-upsmanship, as each one tries to make the other more miserable. It gets increasingly ugly and painful. Then it ends.
5642	4	a	The romantic comedy version of its setting: an overgrown theme park that momentarily amuses, wears down the body and spirit, but mentally stays behind. [Blu-ray]
5643	1	a	Cut from similarly sexy and satirical cloth as Federico Fellini's masterworks a half-century ago, Paolo Sorrentino's movie glides like reverie, probing the emptiness that can result from living a full life.
5644	5	a	[Soul Power], even with its classic performers and songs, falls short of sparking the thrill it should.
5645	3	a	Though the journey is a little bumpy, it's still a trip well worth taking, for all ages.
5646	2	a	Whedon works plenty of smart pop-culture references into his genre-jumping script.
5647	7	a	Revolutionary Road is a dumbed down movie. But it's not dumbed down for just general audiences; it's dumbed down for would-be intellectual audiences, people who are supposed to like books. It sorely fits contemporary times.
5648	6	a	Visually arresting but woefully short on substance David Fincher's adaptation of F. Scott Fitzgearld's short story about a man who ages backward is like a parlor game that wears out its welcome.
5649	1	a	Eastwood's screen adaptation of the famous Dennis Lehane novel is one of the year's most well-made dramas.
5650	1	a	Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri is dark comedy at its finest.
5651	6	a	If stars could be awarded on the basis of good intentions, The Grey Zone should be king of the galaxy. Unfortunately, it lands on earth with something of a thud.
5652	0	a	Imitation Game is partly a tragedy, partly a history lesson, but largely a dramatic plea not just to embrace those who think differently, but actually appreciate them.
5653	6	a	Not well thought-out and a genuine disappointment for all its visibility in the popular conversation
5654	3	a	Michael Mann foregoes the pastel and panache of the original because Colin Farrell is not the same cat as Don Johnson. The result isn't bad; it's just different.
5655	8	a	Just when you thought you'd seen everything, here comes Chinatown, the animated version.
5656	4	a	free-wheeling and enjoyable
5657	6	a	If it wasn't for the cliched bickering between two characters that will eventually fall in love, this could have worked. It's a good subject and a beautiful location.
5658	3	a	Part of the sheer joy of this movie -- aside from the comic timing of Bill Murray -- is the cartoonish crapness of its apparitions and their placid acceptance by the Ghostbusters team.
5659	3	a	There are probably a few actresses who could play the role of an animated Disney princess come to life, but let's be thankful it's Amy Adams who is playing it.
5660	4	a	Don't get too close; don't help out; let them make their own mistakes
5661	5	a	Unfortunately, Felt's actions, while historically important, don't exactly make for riveting drama, especially compared to a classic about two dogged reporters.
5662	3	a	We get a movie that's easy to look at but that leaves us emotionally cold.
5663	4	a	Can I recommend half of a movie?
5664	4	a	The film-maker's relentless even-handedness removes whatever drama the story might have had by making every one of the characters endlessly honorable, devoted to God, home, and family, good to the slaves, and able to spout poetry or the Bible.
5665	5	a	The music gives you some big, sugar-rush moments, but it's a disappointing response to one of pop culture's most brilliant and complicated figures.
5666	6	a	'Round these parts, when a movie promises a million laughs but only delivers a dozen chuckles, that's a hanging offense.
5667	4	a	Though Watts's Elizabeth brings a sense of darkness and unpredictability to the film, the hyperbolic flourishes and the melodramatic climax offset the actresses' best efforts.
5668	10	a	There is no excuse
5669	2	a	In its quiet, literate way, the film is almost as subversive as its central character.
5670	3	a	The reasons for raves at the Sundance Film Festival? The film's charm, freshness, wit and skewiness of vision.
5671	4	a	You can empathize with their pain - or at least you can imagine it - but these are not performances that do justice to the couple's shifting disbelief, grief and sense of self.
5672	9	a	The movie is a ghastly, ramshackle mess, lurching from gag to clunking gag and exacerbated by Barry Peterson's harsh cinematography, making everyone look considerably older than they are.
5673	2	a	[A] warm and utterly beguiling fable.
5674	4	a	Smith and James make such an inspired comedic team ... that the movie's conventional romances can't possibly match the spark these two generate.
5675	4	a	The point is made: life, as the wondrous animals of our very far north know it, is severely endangered. And that can only spell disaster for the inhabitants of lands farther south.
5676	6	a	The multiple contrivances and the inevitable grinding of the storytelling gears will have you itching to go home -- whether you happen to live with your parents or not.
5677	0	a	An honest, original comedy about recognizable human beings.
5678	3	a	The strength of Eastwood's Bridges is in its patience, and how it lets the love story develop from start to finish, even though the audience knows from the beginning the broad strokes of what's going to happen. 
5679	1	a	When a marionette has sex or vomits, you are watching comedy gold, my friends.
5680	6	a	In everything from the score to the costumes and hairstyling, McGuigan seems to think that there's no such thing as too much, a lavishness that just isn't supported by the film's obviously modest budget.
5681	1	a	This is the most fun I've had at a con movie since Dirty Rotten Scoundrels.
5682	3	a	Apatow has an original wit and golden touch that seems to cry out for more sophisticated material: It will be very interesting to see what he does with the free rein that the enormous box-office success of this movie is likely to bring him.
5683	4	a	As refreshing as it may be to see MacFarlane unleashed from the shackles of contemporary pop culture, he's still sent to the gallows by a script that he should have shot down.
5684	1	a	A rare film that's as much fun as you've heard.
5685	4	a	A great film performance-wise, but you wonder what happened to the script.
5686	4	a	The more I think about this film, the more I like it.
5687	6	a	This Irish crime charmer has 'the gift of gab.'
5688	4	a	The latest example of cultural degeneration: The stupid Scary Movie franchise now has one more entry than the smart, satiric Scream series it originally set out to spoof.
5689	6	a	Two Weeks Notice isn't a bad movie; it's just such an automatic, cruise-control flick that it's hard to generate excitement.
5690	4	a	Cookie's Fortune is a wittily diagrammed portrait of a small town shaken to its roots by this deceptive calamity. The movie, though, never really becomes more than a diagram.
5691	2	a	It's the rare case of a comedy sequel that is even better than the original.
5692	7	a	Looks drab and drained of color, and can't even muster the antic buoyancy of an average episode of iCarly.
5693	2	a	Now that he's tackled the topic of sex, Apatow continues his exploration into the world of relationships with the next logical step -- pregnancy -- and in doing so, has created another cult classic.
5694	1	a	This dark, complex and ultimately mournful look at intelligence officials aiming to take down a financial supporter of terrorism features one of Philip Seymour Hoffman's best performances.
5695	2	a	"Disappointing"" isn't the same thing as ""bad."
5696	9	a	An epic comic miscalculation.
5697	9	a	An unencouraging threefold expansion on the former MTV series, accompanying the stunt-hungry dimwits in a random series of collected gags, pranks, pratfalls, dares, injuries, etc.
5698	2	a	Amiable fun, though it's a slight story. The football references were easily understandable even to me, though they were, of course, only the ones I understood. Who knows how many went over my head, like a misjudged shot at goal.
5699	4	a	In Roth's hands, the little character functions as an involuntary and well-intentioned lift. [Full Review in Spanish]
5700	4	a	If ever there was a movie that was all about the action scenes, The Expendables is it.
5701	6	a	Writer Matt Johnson lays on more villains and more chases and more twists, but instead of giving the film more depth, it just turns it increasingly sillier and sillier until it drowns in its own contrivances.
5702	2	a	Filled with sly pleasures for those who can throttle their inner puritan to the floor long enough to find them.
5703	5	a	I didn't believe any of it.
5704	4	a	With a simple storyline that can be slow at times, Cara Delevingne's new movie will earn a place in the hearts of teenage filmgoers. But it doesn't offer the same emotional punch as The Fault In Our Stars.
5705	8	a	I've already seen enough of everything that Doom has to offer.
5706	2	a	Allen will probably never rekindle the magic of his earlier movies, [but] he comes pretty close with Midnight in Paris.
5707	2	a	Meticulously produced and detailed, Geisha is a feast for the eyes, but icy to the touch.
5708	6	a	This one is geared more toward the volleyball players we see early on, leaping and spiking in the sand.
5709	5	a	A perfectly acceptable elongated episode of a television series projected onto a screen several sizes too large for it...more pretender than real contender.
5710	3	a	Exhausting but thrilling at the same time. 
5711	2	a	Although the trappings are familiar, writer Dana Fox has contributed a lean but clever script, and director Clare Kilner keeps the story moving.
5712	5	a	Unfortunately, the filmmakers were overzealous in trying to cover a variety of issues, leaving the story choppy and without resolution in places.
5713	9	a	Very winsome and very long.
5714	2	a	If you like horror as a genre, and prefer a genuine theme over sheer succession of scary sequences, you will like this one.
5715	9	a	As monoumentally stupid and aggressively anti-fun as the film's rancid reputation would have it be.
5716	7	a	Beattie's film eschews the natural intrigue of the original mythology to pump it full of steroids and Hot Topic-style cool, adding an epic conflict between gargoyles and demons which showcases an excess of thought, and yet a shocking lack of brains.
5717	0	a	...has so much sheer style and class that it more closely resembles an old Rat Pack project than a modern-day popcorn dud.
5718	5	a	As the film grinds on, without any actual actors to work against, Jackson starts to look marooned and eventually seems to give up trying.
5719	8	a	...worth watching for Sally Field alone.
5720	4	a	An entertainingly brutal portrait of feckless privilege and buried tragedy, hewing reasonably close to those points we know to be true and juicily provocative about what happened in rooms you and I weren't privy to.
5721	6	a	If Dogma and Chasing Amy were incisive comedies that breathed life into a stagnating genre, then Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back is Kevin Smith's suicide note.
5722	3	a	Poignant, but shot through with welcome touches of humor, it opens a door to an unfamiliar culture, and does so with honesty and heart.
5723	5	a	"Once you peel away the layers, ""American Pastoral"" is at heart a father-daughter love story. McGregor, all furrowed brow, is persistent in his portrayal of Swede, but from behind the camera he's as lost as Merry."
5724	3	a	Director Ash Brannon finds a nice blend of music, adventure and comedy that he presents with a couple of different animation styles.
5725	5	a	"Skeptics and scoffers will find ""Hereafter"" the funniest film of the year. Others, however, might simply yawn at its pretentious cravings, funereal pace, and murky intentions. "
5726	7	a	Step Up: All In has a few dazzling sequences, including the final dance-off, that are effective as minor spectacle, but there's never reason to care.
5727	1	a	Bad Lieutenant is all kinds of wrong, but it feels oh so right.
5728	7	a	"If you can get past the mountain of cliches and poor acting and hackneyed story lines and the fact that someone let Chris Brown be in a movie, ""Battle of the Year"" is actually ... still pretty awful."
5729	1	a	I found myself concentrating more on the strange look of the film and less on the film itself.
5730	3	a	A movie that makes a good initial public offering.
5731	0	a	By far the most original comedy of the year.
5732	5	a	The aliens look like cast-offs from a bad Spielberg film and the whole family are boring examples of Hollywood's ordinary Americans.
5733	5	a	The joy of a great Bond movie is the way it pushes the limits of believability -- and knows when to stop. Octopussy fails.
5734	5	a	Ultimately, fans of the franchise won't be disappointed while the rest of us will be quietly hoping that Homeland Security step in a finish the job.
5735	5	a	Faced with the unenviable choice between honoring his daunting inspiration and telling his own story, the director shoots straight down the middle -- and misses both targets.
5736	0	a	A compelling classic nature story.
5737	3	a	Marc Forster's Christopher Robin is genuinely fun and charming. 
5738	4	a	The riskiest move Seinfeld made was to create an unlikable protagonist who is wrong every step of the way, but treat him like a hero.
5739	6	a	Functions more as a slice of teen life narrative than a coming-of-age story, as its characters never grow enough to fulfill the demands of the latter genre.
5740	6	a	Despite being almost exclusively tailored to pluck at our emotional strings, The Soloist is an oddly uninvolving experience.
5741	5	a	High hopes of magic from the Gondry-Rogen pairing are dashed. Some neat touches aside, this isn't so much eternal sunshine, more superbad.
5742	3	a	As long as the camera concentrates on Winslet and the haute couture, it is beautifully filmed fun.
5743	9	a	"I, Frankenstein,"" you bored...""Blade"" in a blender"
5744	3	a	Another great Vacation movie. Typical dumb tourist antics in Eurpoe, and it still works.
5745	6	a	I suppose in a perfect world, it would be lovely to afford prestige filmmakers the opportunity to relax once in a while, to make a small, lightweight feel good movie, but Ang Lee's take on Woodstock is nothing short of disappointing.
5746	3	a	One of the few recent Hollywood films out there that has used new digital technology to truly engage the viewer, and make possible a thoughtful story.
5747	3	a	One of the year's most beguiling films...it has the fizz of fine champagne and delivers a wonderful kick.
5748	6	a	Director Donald Petrie and screenwriter Tom Schulman are masters of middle-of- the-road blandness. What they provide is harmless and occasionally worth a chuckle, but there's not much point in watching a movie when you already know every line.
5749	3	a	I'd be a grouch to call the two leads anything but delightful, and they both stretch in directions you mightn't expect. 
5750	9	a	The genre of the movie musical is in a sad state. This is a genre that did not need Von Trier's 'help'.
5751	5	a	The pieces of a potential franchise are put in play here without stakes being raised or pulses quickened.
5752	3	a	What The Expendables does right is it caters to its fans. It knows exactly what they want and it delivers a a pure, adrenaline-fuelled thrill ride with some great action.
5753	10	a	If you want to lose a guy in one day, drag him to see this movie.
5754	4	a	Less like a complete movie, Hancock plays out more like the first two episodes of a television series shown back to back.
5755	5	a	This is a film designed not so much to tell a coherent and moving story as it is to deliver a van full of cinematic groceries to a certain audience.
5756	3	a	Reign of Fire is hardly the most original fantasy film ever made -- beyond Road Warrior, it owes enormous debts to Aliens and every previous dragon drama -- but that barely makes it any less entertaining.
5757	6	a	Watching Bertrand Bonello's new film is less Saint Laurent than The Saint Laurent Experience: It's the biopic as fever dream.
5758	9	a	It's all too appropriate that this thing is narrated by Michael Gross.
5759	4	a	Always the star of his movies, even when he shouldn't be, the atheist Moretti gets caught up in his own papal bull. But Piccoli's blessed empathy prevails.
5760	4	a	It would make a cute TV show.
5761	4	a	There doesn't seem to be enough material here to satisfy a full length feature, and the movie, which starts with such promise, begins to drag around its midpoint.
5762	1	a	Metaphysics, madness and Mancala meet in this fun, fresh and overtly philosophical tale about, well, all kinds of things, really.
5763	2	a	Featuring an eclectic cast and unusual choice of filmmaker, The Green Hornet succeeds as an experiment done right.
5764	6	a	Despite Bullock's comic flair and Hugh Grant's charming turn as a bumbling billionaire, they can't carry this romantic comedy just on witty repartee.
5765	5	a	You just want it all to stop and for real actors and scriptwriters to be parachuted in.
5766	3	a	A potent balance of the heartfelt and hilarious, Nebraska is a small gem and one of Alexander Payne's best films yet.
5767	4	a	Loaded with enough stupid pet and human tricks to satisfy David Letterman for years to come.
5768	4	a	Videocracy is a queasy-funny and unapologetically biased look at the televisual world that the Italian prime minister, Silvio Berlusconi, has created.
5769	5	a	A film so egregiously bad that it really should be chopped into small pieces and buried under a freeway overpass.
5770	3	a	'The Light Between Oceans' is an emotionally charged feature whose impact is blunted by its methodical and deliberate pacing.
5771	5	a	If you've ever seen a spy thriller, you'll know where it's all heading, with the final twist particularly unsurprising.
5772	3	a	[It] sneaks up on the audience with the quiet discretion of the enigmatic protagonist at its center. And, like him, it contains multitudes beneath its prim surface.
5773	3	a	It's not one of Almodovar's more emotionally involving films, it's actually quite chillingly cold but Antonio Banderas is just fabulous as the Frankenstein character and Elena Anaya is exquisite as his creation. 
5774	4	a	Some fun and interesting moments but without much real insight.
5775	3	a	By the time you leave, Jackson will have you believing that his Coach Carter is a true original.
5776	1	a	As exquisitely photographed as Hero, but with a genuine story.
5777	5	a	Something of a disaster -- it isn't funny and, though both stars try their best, there's precious little actual story there for them to work with.
5778	3	a	Hoffman's accent sounds like no German I've ever heard, but he sticks to it and makes it work by sheer force of will.
5779	0	a	This Bressonian hybrid will launch writer-director Chloe Zhao and leading man and real-life cowboy Brady Jandreau. A not to be missed spiritual journey of man and horse.
5780	4	a	Skyfall abounds with bum notes and unfortunate compromises. But Mendes has found many fresh things to do with this dusty old machine.
5781	2	a	Mary Queen of Scots is a crisply acted tale of palace intrigue, loaded with betrayal and sexual machinations. Saoirse Ronan and Margot Robbie deliver spellbinding performances.
5782	6	a	There are triumphs, both in front of and behind the camera, but they often get overshadowed by a story that tries to do too much.
5783	7	a	It's all fight scenes, and the fight scenes have no arc. You just sit there waiting for some inevitable deus ex machina to save the day whenever Peter Jackson feels like it. The characters have no agency. It's like watching a kid play with his GI Joes.
5784	0	a	This meaningful film keeps the laughs, giddy anxiousness and warm butterflies from the trailer and sustains it all through two full hours of a love story.
5785	0	a	Physical violence may give the initial sting, but it's the film's psychological violence that leaves the lasting impression.
5786	6	a	Much closer to Adam Sandler than Bulworth.
5787	3	a	Incredibly fun to see with an audience and the best installment since the original.
5788	5	a	The Cloverfield Paradox is an unholy mess.
5789	6	a	To be fair, Schrader's version fails in ways that Harlin's dumbed-down version didn't.
5790	0	a	She Done Him Wrong is the stuff of legend.
5791	0	a	It maintains a defiant optimism that the actions of individuals matter.
5792	4	a	You may want to rule this one out.
5793	4	a	A heavy-handed but accurate social satire on the Iraq War and America's nauseating attempt to package it as a necessary war back home.
5794	4	a	It's not the Sally Field we expect, and though there are plenty of reasons to empathize with her blinkered protagonist, her fiercely committed turn doesn't sand down the rough edges. 
5795	6	a	It's all a bit too mundane to be as magical as it aspires to be. For all of its potential, The House with a Clock in Its Walls seems like a major missed opportunity. 
5796	4	a	Doesn't work as a goodbye to Kirk or as a hello to Picard.
5797	7	a	Gives Hollywood an excuse not to make more Westerns, just as it's bad for the future of graphic novel adaptations ... save your money and buy the trades.
5798	6	a	Slick, predictable, routine race-against-the-clock stuff.
5799	7	a	Failure to Launch? The same can be said for the movie.
5800	0	a	a cold, sad requiem for a generation of the lost.
5801	2	a	A high-spirited hillbilly-heist caper with a dynamite, all-star ensemble cast.
5802	4	a	All buzz, no sting.
5803	6	a	A watered-down, CG-saturated nod to moviemaking convention.
5804	1	a	I could not take my eyes off the film and never once wanted to exit the theatre, all of which are attributes I don't want to diminish or dispute in any way whatsoever.
5805	8	a	To battle the logic of the film would be to swat flies in a hurricane.
5806	2	a	[An] entertaining film that didn't deserve to sink into oblivion.
5807	9	a	Frankly, your children deserve better.
5808	6	a	not spectacularly unfunny or appallingly made; it's just a rote treatment of a familiar subject
5809	6	a	In theory, it had all the signs of a ripe Mirren performance, but she's undone by a weak script that leaves her flailing like an Olympic swimmer in a pool full of jelly.
5810	0	a	Count Orlock, played by the hideous Max Schreck, creeps through Murnau's archetypal silent imagery with a mesmerising authority that retains a surprising amount of tension.
5811	3	a	Funny, rude and with a heart of gold that surprisingly doesn't grate.
5812	4	a	It's the movie's wobbly tone and its betrayal of its characters in the name of niceness that dooms The Break-Up into being a film that will satisfy no one -- not even the bottom-line thinkers.
5813	3	a	This morning, the unconscious bodies of three pickpockets were found in front of the Post's offices. Safety-pinned to one was an envelope containing the following movie review.
5814	7	a	The real question is whether Dave and Stoney and Link are worthy heirs to Bill and Ted or Wayne and Garth. Not really.
5815	5	a	You, Me and Dupree features three first-rate actors in need of a first-rate movie.
5816	5	a	Well-shot but badly written tale set in a future ravaged by dragons.
5817	0	a	A stunning masterpiece, front-loaded with atmospheric mood and poignant tenderness.
5818	1	a	One of the cleverest updates of the caper film to appear in quite a while.
5819	2	a	At a first glance it doesn't seem to be any purpose to the film, but this is a tale about family and a dysfunctional one at best. [Full review in Spanish]
5820	3	a	This is a very funny, heartwarming film. It has fun with the quirks of family life, but it also treats the subject with fondness and respect.
5821	3	a	Bright Star is a beautiful film, filled with the glories of nature and man that inspired Keats.
5822	1	a	"With spectacular action sequences, a rock-solid star and a ration of cheese that's good English cheddar, ""Skyfall"" is a gift from above."
5823	9	a	Up until he becomes somewhat manly, Bateman's character's supreme ineptness is less funny than nerve-wracking. There's way more grossness than hilarity. Don't get conned.
5824	2	a	Hereafter is imperfect but it is less about understanding our final destination than how we map out our own course to arrive there
5825	1	a	Casts a spell- right from the first frame. For anyone that truly loves film.
5826	8	a	Spielberg has crafted a nearly perfect film, a gripping and brilliantly acted epic .
5827	4	a	It never quite engages, perhaps due to a pace that plods, a running time of over two hours, and a mishandled third act.
5828	6	a	Jackson's risky creative choices have drained Bilbo Baggins' adventure of its magic.
5829	4	a	Ignoring the weak storyline entirely, Rango is a joyously weird experience, far more concerned with texture and flavor than with elaborate narrative.
5830	4	a	The movie's too long, and the direction is sometimes slack -- but the script is crammed with withering ripostes, ably delivered by Nicholson and Hunt.
5831	1	a	...Wright, Pegg, and Frost turn The World's End into a classic comedy with enough depth to defy even the most massive expectations.
5832	9	a	Is there anything worse than a Martin Lawrence movie?
5833	3	a	With a fantastic cast and razor-sharp pacing, the fact is that this is what you want from a movie called The Predator.
5834	4	a	Even if it accomplishes little else, Dead Man will almost certainly inspire thought and discussion. 
5835	3	a	the neo-western byproduct of a deranged and adrift zeitgeist
5836	4	a	Ever wondered how Love, Actually might have turned out if Richard Curtis had written it with a hangover?
5837	1	a	"Where Moorhouse could have veered toward the overwrought and sentimental, a la ""Fried Green Tomatoes,"" she steers the movie through the more believable middle ground of genuine emotion."
5838	5	a	[T]he premise of this movie assumes the very idea of animals talking must be side-splitting... but writer-director Steve Oedekerk doesn't give them many humorous things to say.
5839	3	a	Few films so gloriously live up to their potential.
5840	3	a	"The stripped-down, slightly grittier feel of the movie carries us along - and, perhaps, even announces a direction for the series that's both new to young fans and as old as ""From Russia With Love."
5841	9	a	What the filmmakers fail to recognize is that history on the page is quite different from what it needs to be onscreen, namely alive and visceral.
5842	5	a	Refreshingly, it's not as lowbrow or silly as your typical youth-oriented comedy of late.
5843	4	a	Beresford does make absolutely sure the big themes central to Cunxin's journey ring out loudly enough to strike those heart strings at which he is so clearly and shamelessly taking aim.
5844	4	a	The best screwball comedies seem to breathe helium, but this one never gets airborne.
5845	5	a	American Pastoral is a confusing failure of a movie, but not baffling enough to warrant a recommendation
5846	1	a	[Gus Van Sant is] an incredible visual artist who can use the camera to capture seemingly languorous interludes that are, in fact, riveting to the eye and mind.
5847	3	a	Like the late Klaus Kinski, who so often played crazies in Herzog's earlier movies, Cage is in your face all the way. Laughing maniacally, lying with no sign of a conscience, he pushes the character's frequent tantrums beyond over-the-top.
5848	7	a	[Yumiko Shaku] doesn't project the confidence or menace that the role requires. Trying to pass her off as a stone-cold assassin is like casting Britney Spears as Marie Curie -- it just doesn't jibe.
5849	2	a	A surprisingly clever and hilariously bizarre take on the Gen-X teen experience.
5850	9	a	The movie that no studio wanted... and with good reason.
5851	7	a	A shrill, unfunny litany of single-folk stereotypes that insults men and women with equal abandon.
5852	2	a	A Lebowski-esque adaptation of Thomas Pynchon's novel that's as bewildering as it is entertaining.
5853	4	a	Merely good and not great as many fans of the book hoped it would be.
5854	9	a	It has no artistic or social value, and it contains not one genuine laugh.
5855	3	a	"Maybe fashioning it as a trilogy with ""Shaun"" and ""Hot Fuzz"" wasn't a great idea since it leads to comparisons it can't possibly live up to being such a different movie."
5856	2	a	"Featuring a dangerously seductive performance from the great Daniel Auteuil, ""Sade"" covers the same period as Kaufmann's ""Quills"" with more unsettlingly realistic results."
5857	2	a	An efficient wartime dramedy about middle-aged restlessness and the bubbles we build to distract ourselves from real life.
5858	4	a	Hoffman heads an impressive cast and the plot is well crafted, even if the characters and moral uncertainties seem very familiar and the message remains the same.
5859	3	a	[T]hink of it as The Purple Rose of Cairo for kids.
5860	4	a	Even with decent turns from the leads, and a usefully soulful one from Gary Cole as a neighbor inclined to do the proverbial keeping up, the film can't always manage to justify itself as an actual movie instead of merely a clever concept.
5861	4	a	Aficionados of the comic book will cringe... but hey, it's a fun popcorn flick.
5862	10	a	Guccione, in his pursuit of historical accuracy has instead made a film that is such a painstaking, arduous task to watch in its entirety that I doubt anyone can sit through an hour of it without irreversible psychological damage.
5863	5	a	While its television counterpart will continue to live on in syndication, this version is headed for Boot Hill.
5864	3	a	Crowe simply remembers how to make a sweet story. He allows his huge heart to prevail in a moving coda that, while manipulative, helped me buy into this sentimental tone poem to simple destiny. 
5865	2	a	There's something particularly delightful -- and subversive -- about a high-concept comedy that turns into something resonant.
5866	2	a	The Prestige's chief pleasure lies in [Jackman and Bale's] increasingly ornate games of deception, which Nolan orchestrates with a showman's aplomb.
5867	6	a	Lazin's film gets off to a bad start with a miscalculated opening sequence presented in a way that implies we're listening to Shakur speak about his own murder, an impossibility that undermines the film's documentary credibility.
5868	4	a	Jackson's elegant performance gives the frequently tough to swallow story some credence.
5869	3	a	Still overwhelms and entertains with the best of them.
5870	3	a	A fantastic foray into the front of psychological thrillers.
5871	4	a	Though the film feeds on its forerunner, it's worthwhile on its own terms.
5872	4	a	When I heard the sequel's title, I strongly considered resigning this post.
5873	3	a	A seductive, woeful meditation on phony efforts and the challenge of living for the moment.
5874	3	a	Ask not where the film is leading; that's hardly the point. The plot amounts to an arrangement of red herrings and besides, solutions are for squares.
5875	6	a	Not badly executed, but not the least bit original either.
5876	4	a	There is comedy in it. But mostly there's just a kind of soft, quiet sadness - about lives unlived, about chances lost, about loves forever unexpressed.
5877	6	a	Plot holes come at you at a dizzying pace, and they can be rather extreme.
5878	5	a	Daniela Thomas seems stymied by her own images, unable to extract the turmoil and violence suggested by her story for fear of upsetting the austere surface harmony of her visuals.
5879	2	a	The film is so visually vivid, Mann could almost get away with taking out the ham-fisted dialog completely and let the whole thing run silent.
5880	4	a	Crowe's greatest strength is in taking these potentially cloying elements and making them feel human and comforting rather than contrived and sappy.
5881	3	a	Apparently, all the world needs a hero and there is nobody better than Brad Pitt, with all his untouchable starriness, to fill those boots.
5882	0	a	Here is a movie loaded with raunchy jokes about premarital sex and getting stoned that is not just soda-out-the-nose funny but also one of the most life-affirming and pro-marriage movies ever made.
5883	9	a	Hannibal Lecter does not need a creation story; he just needs to go away. The meal is over.
5884	6	a	The year's best looking movie.
5885	0	a	Three Billboards Outside of Ebbing, Missouri unfolds as a typical revenge vigilantly ploy, and could have stayed so under normal direction and screenwriting. Instead, it gets turned into one of the best pictures of the year.
5886	1	a	This is one rock and roll movie with a chance of being remembered, one with something to say and the style and energy to say it well.
5887	4	a	The foundation of a much better movie is buried somewhere beneath the debris that's too quickly piled on to The Kings of Summer ...
5888	6	a	Passes by in a haze of amateurish acting and skateboarding montages. Just one more wearisome representation of aimless teenage life.
5889	1	a	It is witty, intelligent and unusual -- a most gratifying experience.
5890	2	a	"If you like your movies filled with twisted humor, sexual perversion, psychological intimidation and sudden violence, ""Killer Joe"" is the flick for you."
5891	0	a	The effects have barely aged and the joy is timeless. Take a child who's never seen it and watch their imagination expand before your eyes.
5892	4	a	It doesn't get anymore romantic than this
5893	4	a	Blemished but undeniably enthralling as dark entertainment, Hannibal Rising is one of the good ones.
5894	2	a	We are saved throughout by Watson's performance.
5895	9	a	"The film shamelessly imitates characters and situations seen in similar movies, like ""The Hunger Games"". [Full review in Spanish]"
5896	1	a	The movie has the space and freedom of classic Western epics.
5897	3	a	Amistad is worth seeing just for people to know about this important story, this moment in history. But from the world's most powerful, successful and famous director, we expect more.
5898	9	a	Gone is the nuance, the mystery, the fright factor, in its place a near-campy Dr. Phibes-like obsession with revenge.
5899	0	a	A pulp classic with a crackerjack ending.
5900	4	a	As far as the Friday series goes, this is more fun than anyone had any right to imagine.
5901	5	a	Though occasionally funny and filled with amusing bit-performances Identity Thief's deeply unlikable co-protagonist stops this would-be buddy comedy in its tracks.
5902	0	a	it just might be the best movie you'll see all year. 
5903	3	a	Excellent and tasty B-movie psuedo-zombie goodness.
5904	1	a	"An epic romantic period piece with deeply felt performances, beautiful costumes and exquisitely framed sets, Geisha pretty much defines the phrase ""Oscar contender."
5905	6	a	"Jane Eyre"" this is not. Instead, ""Crimson Peak"" seems to use admittedly smashing costumes to cover up a lack of compelling narrative."
5906	4	a	You're either on board with what Twohy was trying to achieve here or not. Unfortunately, suspension of disbelief only can go so far.
5907	6	a	Part suspense thriller about the failed assassination of Hiter, part social protest drama, part star vehicle to reenergize Tom Cruise's troubled career, Valkyrie is engaging but not a good thriller.
5908	5	a	The kind of movie beloved by people who never go to the movies, because they are primarily interested in something else -- the Civil War, for example -- and think historical accuracy is a virtue instead of an attribute.
5909	4	a	Disappointingly pedestrian for a movie with such ripe and easy targets for much sharper satire.
5910	1	a	"The Prestige"" is a terrifically entertaining thriller even if you spot the false bottoms and secret trap doors in the screenplay."
5911	5	a	Packed with characters wallowing in self-conscious cool that's as tedious as their anomie.
5912	3	a	Close's performance is flawless, so much so that it's possible that she could have passed to an audience not expecting to see her in the role
5913	0	a	Schindler's List is a true dramatic classic, capable of making anyone cry.
5914	9	a	I felt as if someone had dragged me into the kitchen of my local Greggs, and was baking my head into the centre of a colossal cube of white bread.
5915	3	a	A poignant exploration of the cruelty and anguish of teenage existence.
5916	0	a	A loaded dance of desire.
5917	5	a	It throws in enough calculated accouterments to honestly earn the label of 'product.'
5918	0	a	The Artist doesn't talk, but it sings.
5919	4	a	If there is one thing to be said of this picture, it's to simply enjoy it for what it's worth.
5920	3	a	Despite some unevenness it is a good show indeed.
5921	3	a	Gritty, raw, and kooky at times, Bad Lieutenant is one of those movies that you can't really look away, even though you may want to for certain scenes.
5922	0	a	Minutes into the audaciously animated Rango, I wondered whether someone had slipped peyote into my soft drink... This movie is obviously not right in the head, and I love it.
5923	1	a	A love song to the new Europe ... and a snapshot of a polyglot gang on the cusp of kind-of- reckless youth and responsibility- burdened adulthood.
5924	3	a	Choose a good excuse to see Danny Boyle work his directorial magic on a nostalgia blast.
5925	1	a	One of the great musicals.
5926	6	a	Lurches from realism to corn-pone absurdism and exploitation-cinema surrealism.
5927	2	a	An adroit crowd-pleaser, and Jolie and Burns exude charisma and the right chemistry.
5928	6	a	It rarely rises to the level of entertainment you expect from a wartime thriller -- there's something rote and foregone about the whole affair.
5929	9	a	How much more interesting - and scary - to have given Hannibal a perfectly happy boyhood with not the smallest occasion for anger or violence.
5930	6	a	To call it preachy isn't necessarily a critique; the entire film is essentially built around a closing sermon.
5931	2	a	Creates a convincing air of menace and features some marvellous scenes set to period music.
5932	6	a	Here we get the uncanny suspicion that Hook was written and directed according to the famous recipe of the country preacher who told the folks what he was going to tell them, told them, and then told them what he had told them.
5933	4	a	Simple, predictable, and marginally satisfying.
5934	4	a	As the head of this diamondback-rattlesnake-of-a-film, Matthew McConaughey strikes within a sadistic realm very few actors would dare to tread. 
5935	7	a	Like the dolled-up women, the film is pleasing to the eyes and inscrutable. The mystery, though, is tedious rather than captivating.
5936	9	a	A lazy knock-off film that plays a lot of familiar notes but doesn't once strike a chord nor find a melody of its own.
5937	3	a	This feminist war dramedy...is a vanity project done right.
5938	1	a	The hardest-working musical biopic in show business.
5939	2	a	Revel in the sheer insanity and unique humor of this cracking jungle adventure.
5940	3	a	The scenes of Africans marching in chains and stocks, monitored by other Africans, are a shock and linger in your mind for days afterward.
5941	4	a	Ralph Breaks the Internet is everything that made Wreck-It Ralph enjoyable, painted on a canvas as big as the Internet itself. The satire is sharp and the pace is relentless.
5942	1	a	A movie both hilarious and sometimes heart-stoppingly exciting.
5943	6	a	In its way Campion's film is a thing of beauty, but its characters' inner lives must be taken on faith.
5944	4	a	Eat Pray Love ... [hits] its target demographic right between the eyes, but in the same way that a self-help book may appeal to thousands, it will never be great literature. 
5945	3	a	Effective action, solid suspense, excellent Ribisi, plus enough cliches to equal the grains of Gobi sand that fill the screen.
5946	4	a	Westfeldt's screenplay is often sharp, shrewd and funny...
5947	4	a	Once the adventure is finally underway, and Martin Freeman's meek hero starts to come into his own, Jackson digs in and delivers an appropriately epic companion piece to his earlier trilogy.
5948	3	a	Goldberg's best work since The Color Purple.
5949	6	a	Figgis brings strong visual imagination to the first hour, but he can't rescue Richard Jefferies's screenplay from plot holes bigger than the manor itself.
5950	1	a	Don Cheadle -- explosive because you've never before seen this model of actorly restraint -- is a one-man fireworks show in Talk to Me, Kasi Lemmons' rollicking, resonant portrait of the real-life ex-con who improbably became a civic icon.
5951	9	a	A cross between Jurassic Park and those traveling Renaissance fairs where gnawing on turkey legs and peering at the padded bosoms of college kids pretending to be wenches is supposed to make us feel medieval.
5952	4	a	Despite its emotional inaccessibility and overreliance on aesthetics, is still worth a watch for those with maturity and patience.
5953	6	a	The death sequences are fun; unfortunately, nearly everything in between is tedious and mechanical.
5954	4	a	Brewer knows his music, and how to make it the center of a story; if he only did a better job filling in the rest of the blanks, this might've worked.
5955	5	a	When the highlight of your movie is a catfight between Teri Hatcher and Charlize Theron...well, it's not necessarily a bad thing, but it couldve been better
5956	5	a	Silly, frenetic, sometimes-crude 'toon based on popular app.
5957	3	a	A one-joke movie that makes such good use of its one joke that it almost demands a kind of grudging admiration.
5958	1	a	Of all the performances, Samuel L. Jackson's is the most surprising. It sometimes appears that the busy Jackson will take almost any role to stay working. This film provides a reminder of his subtlety.
5959	10	a	Let me say that I have seen this hump-obsessed raunch-com, but you haven't. And, hopefully, you'll be working to keep it that way.
5960	5	a	Has a few funny moments, but pretty lame overall.
5961	1	a	The Artist encapsulates everything we go to movies for: action, laughs, tears and a chance to get lost in another world. How can Oscar resist?
5962	5	a	McFarlane's courting of Charlize Theron occasionally plays with the gag-inducing coyness of a Katherine Heigl rom-com.
5963	3	a	Where Babe was warm, gentle, and cuddly, Pig in the City is fast paced and antic.
5964	1	a	Murray has been singing songs to us ever since his old days on Saturday Night Live, but never like this.
5965	6	a	The title not only succinctly sums up the basic premise, but the totality of Perry's development of it.
5966	2	a	Entertaining, but brainless, popcorn fun.
5967	6	a	In the end you are left with the feeling that Whedon works better on television than in the cinema.
5968	1	a	The strengths are amazing, and it's pretty impressive how thoroughly and successfully the movie rewrote the vocabulary of action cinema.
5969	1	a	Demme is a master of finding the bizarre in the ordinary... This is one of those rare movies where the plot seems surprised at what the characters do.
5970	1	a	This story is powerful and inspiring stuff. The skill used to tell it should be witnessed by all.
5971	3	a	The ideal combination of grown-up concerns and childlike joy for big goofy movies.
5972	7	a	It provides no thrills, no remotely sympathetic characters and -- despite a tortuous plot that goes to great lengths to trick the audience -- no surprises.
5973	9	a	Big guns, big hats, big motorcycles, big trucks. There is obviously more being projected here than just a movie
5974	6	a	She's identified almost entirely by her haircut at the end--just as the actress who plays her has been for much of her career.
5975	6	a	Crimson Peak is a classic case of style over substance resulting in a hollow movie experience that never fully reaches its potential.
5976	6	a	Owen Wilson crashes a marriage.
5977	4	a	On paper a routine sports yarn. On screen, thanks to Jackson refusing to phone it in, far more satisfying than you might expect.
5978	5	a	This is the most dubious animation since Robert Zemeckis's creepy The Polar Express, only uglier, lazier, and with a more indisputable racist streak.
5979	4	a	"Like Pen-ek Ratanaruang's Last Life in the Universe, Kontroll is another ""chill out"" production that's alternately lovely and sinister."
5980	3	a	"Guy Pearce gives a riveting performance in ""The Rover,"" full of quiet rage, ruthlessness and single-minded determination."
5981	6	a	The Sandlot is a safe, wholesome, patriotic family picture about baseball, and if there is an original scene, it escaped my attention.
5982	5	a	The script is uninspired, the picture's characters are stick figures, its dialogue is lackluster and the star's performance seldom rises above the adequate.
5983	4	a	Messy and chaotic ... but also colorful and kind of fun.
5984	3	a	The film has various archival footage, old photos and many dialogues, full of tragedy.
5985	5	a	Good premise undercut by too much last-minute editing
5986	0	a	A pleasant, if predictable, diversion peppered with incessant chatter on the part of the irrepressible Kevin Hart.
5987	3	a	Nurse Betty's two hallmarks are originality and star quality, both of which combine to draw the viewer through the film's occasional rough spots.
5988	4	a	What Hitchcock lacks in substance it makes up for with a bravo cast.
5989	4	a	Smith is a gifted comic actor, and seeing him in a lighthearted comedy, his first romantic lead, is a pure pleasure.
5990	4	a	Ryan's tough-minded little movie avoids any sort of sentimentality; nothing warm and fuzzy here, just honest emotions from two excellent young actresses.
5991	5	a	"A mushy metaphor for what it takes to bring a ""Cameron Crowe movie"" to the big screen."
5992	9	a	Barry Levinson's straggly sort-of-comedy is staggeringly misconceived.
5993	9	a	The SNL skits are better
5994	4	a	Hitch falls into that weird gray area of movies I sort of liked, but sort of didn't.
5995	0	a	Under Haynes' sure hand, Blanchett and Mara deliver a love story to melt to.
5996	4	a	Child is father to the man in this often funny, but just as often ham-fisted, untrue Hollywood story.
5997	6	a	Chaotic, loud and filled with too many coincidences to count. The best thing that can be said about The Predator is that the dialogue is engaging, and some gags are funny. 
5998	5	a	The filmmakers can't get the balance right between comedy and cruelty.
5999	3	a	The film is affable enough, though nothing much seems to be at stake.
6000	5	a	Sarah Jessica Parker's career no longer seems to involve acting so much as nurturing brand identity.
6001	3	a	A solid Western has ridden into town ... and if you like gritty films about this era, you'll want to make its acquaintance.
6002	3	a	Some will write off Logan Lucky as one of Soderbergh's most frivolous efforts, but that would be a mistake. 
6003	9	a	Way to kill that dark comedy you were going for.
6004	6	a	The performances in Bandslam are uniformly strong -- good enough to make you wish this bunch of charismatic, talented kids had been given better material.
6005	2	a	It's the lack of one other ingredient -- saccharine -- that makes the emotional life of a film about a faded movie star feel true and real.
6006	10	a	Even Amtrak hasn't seen a derailment this godawful in some time.
6007	5	a	Apparently in space, nobody can hear you say 'meh.' 
6008	6	a	Reducing a summer blockbuster to the scale of a primetime sitcom is novel, but it isn't admirable.
6009	2	a	The first chapter of Jackson's new trilogy is decent, if not enirely satisfying, bound to suffer from inevitable comparisons with the superior, Oscar-winning Lord of the Rings.
6010	4	a	Is Eminem a movie star? Only when he raps.
6011	1	a	Unexpectedly buoyant; it skims over a life as if tunefully improvising, touching just the right note here and there.
6012	3	a	'Safety Not Guaranteed' is a little comedy that makes the world safe for personal ads. 
6013	4	a	While No Country For Old Men is compelling from beginning to end, the film lacks soul.
6014	1	a	Simultaneously shiny and retro, calibrated and uncalculated, familiar and unpredictable.
6015	6	a	It's all rather messy in lots of ways. Fortunately the appealing presence and physical comedy of Cook and Fogler fill a lot of holes that would otherwise just be dirty ditches.
6016	3	a	Warm, familiar, not a sharp edge in sight, this movie is built to please.
6017	4	a	The film is more affecting than it ought to be, thanks to a loaded cast that includes Alfre Woodard, Tim Blake Nelson, Will Patton, Charles Dutton, and the rapper and sometime actor Xzibit.
6018	3	a	The result may be flimsy, but it goes out and grabs you from the start.
6019	6	a	As a big fan of Alien, I really enjoyed this... to a point. Then the second half left me thinking of the Geico commercial with the fisherman saying 'oooh you almost had it.' 
6020	0	a	Impressively directed, thoroughly engaging drama with terrific performances and a superb script. This is one of the best films of the year.
6021	4	a	Weir and cowriter Keith R. Clarke resist the temptation to add Hollywood happy endings to Rawicz's story.
6022	3	a	Who cares about the rampant case of sequelitis its infected with as long as it delivers the goods to the paying customers
6023	0	a	Watch how inventively Mr. Antal keeps the action moving and you'll see why his picture has won a passel of prizes, bestowed by everyone from the Cannes Film Festival to the Budapest Hungarian Film Critics organization.
6024	4	a	Gondry and Rogen walk a fine line between fairly brainless bro-medy and occasionally knowing examination of the superhero genre.
6025	4	a	The cast is the only winning ensemble The Dressmaker needs.
6026	4	a	Quasi-evil - to quote Dr. Evil
6027	6	a	Director Bryan Singer approaches this sensitive material as a strict procedural. It's almost as if we are joining part two of a miniseries already in progress.
6028	3	a	The Ring, an elegantly creepy film set in a perpetual Seattle rainstorm, is interested more in eerie, unnerving thrills than bloodletting.
6029	4	a	Bening's performance is subtle and courageous.
6030	1	a	Any of Guadagnino's cinematic trips to sunny Italy are worth taking, but Call Me By Your Name may be his most tender and sumptuous work yet. 
6031	4	a	Hanks directs with assurance. Perhaps if he had teamed with a more agile writer, less given to cheesy yuck-fests, Larry Crowne would be the nuanced adult love story it aims to be.
6032	0	a	One of the most pleasant surprises I've had at the movies all year.
6033	3	a	Russell distils his own toxic kind of nitrous oxide and pipes it into the cinema.
6034	1	a	A gorgeous, surprisingly meditative look at the beauty of life and the mysteries of death.
6035	2	a	It is a shame that a movie tweaking retro cliches falls into the white bread conventions itself, especially from a Madrid-based production company.
6036	4	a	The plot itself is convoluted sci-fi fare, taking in elements of botany, biology and philosophy, but it makes more sense than Pearl Harbor and the cast seems a lot more human.
6037	2	a	"Full of agreeable performances and a few ""aha"" moments that most filmmakers would kill for, but it never comes together in any meaningful way."
6038	4	a	With Stan Winston's disturbingly realistic effects and spine-chilling mountain men, Wrong Turn takes the concept of hillbillies to a whole new level. You seriously may never go into the woods again.
6039	4	a	'Despite all its flaws, this Phoenix rises to an acceptable entertainment level.'
6040	4	a	Pulling off a commendable movie version of the game was always going to be a difficult task, no matter how good the graphics or the one-liners. In the end, it's the target audience that really matters.
6041	0	a	Small, naturalistic moments like a scene of father and son scrambling to quickly eat breakfast and leave the apartment collectively give the Yiddish-language movie its quiet but unmistakable power.
6042	3	a	As a science fiction film that relies more on viewers' intelligence than special effects, it represents something that is sorely missed in today's Hollywood.
6043	3	a	A smartly written and funny popcorn flick that is a lot of fun.
6044	3	a	It ain't Eminem: The Movie but it does showcase Eminem: The Actor -- easily the best rapper-cum-thesp since Tupac Shakur.
6045	1	a	Mystic River is full of details that stay with you.
6046	3	a	A deliciously unpredictable thriller with a dark, very offbeat sense of humor.
6047	8	a	The film's sentiments are so hollow they wind up doing an injustice to the very real problems that exist in a world where racial inequality and the myriad of concerns the spring from it, are far more complex than simply black and white. 
6048	6	a	Stretches the darkly comedic aspects of the trilogy to the breaking point.
6049	5	a	...while Depp seems the obvious choice for this ribald role, this is the first performance he's let get away from him.
6050	3	a	The kind of flick that gives fluff a good name.
6051	3	a	Holy Columbian marching powder, you'll be hard-pressed to find a more adrenaline-soaked, palpitation-inducing, stress-ride at the cinema.
6052	3	a	...highly amusing...at times leaves most of the men in the audience throwing their heads back and realizing exactly how realistic the situation at hand is.
6053	5	a	There are still plenty of good laughs ... but a lot of film misses the mark.
6054	5	a	Sadly, tragically, Early Man is just not very good.
6055	4	a	Engaging real-life war drama.
6056	0	a	Even death is part of the flow, part of the process of getting along and finding a place in the world.
6057	6	a	Unlike many films of this genre, it has a plot that makes sense and it has characters that are least defined, if not developed.
6058	6	a	Snake Eyes opens on a roll, but ultimately craps out.
6059	9	a	"One laugh -- Vampires, stuffed in their coffins on a horse-drawn wagon, whining to the driver -- ""Are ve DERE yet?"
6060	0	a	Is the movie corny? Often. Is it moving in the most basic, moral way? Every year we watch it.
6061	10	a	In the slasher genre, this is as bad as they come.
6062	3	a	A cinematic treat offering rare peeks behind the scenes and behind the closed doors of a legendary director and the love of his life. 
6063	9	a	Basically an improv scene sprawling to feature length.
6064	1	a	[I]n terms of pure beauty, Memoirs of a Geisha is among the most gorgeous films ever created, a magnificent cherry blossom of a movie, evoking the lovely mysteries of geisha life.
6065	6	a	Offers some glimpses of what [Kubrick] was capable of doing with no budget and no crew and no actors.
6066	6	a	A hybrid of trashy period piece and stately Masterpiece Theater episode, this kitschy melodrama can't decide how much to exploit its juicy text about lusty King Henry VIII and his relationships with the Boleyn sisters.
6067	6	a	Delivers a knockout punch for teens and/or game fans but may repulse or bore everybody else.
6068	3	a	Amistad tells a compelling story and it tells it well.
6069	4	a	Will never be any better than average, but we were always promised unapologetic, violent, action-oriented fun and so if you go in with that in mind you'd have to have a stone-cold heart not to have a blast.
6070	0	a	Wood's movies might have been the worst ever made, but they inspired true brilliance. This just might be Tim Burton's masterpiece.
6071	3	a	Anthony Hopkins' thoroughly entertaining take on Hitchcock and his great scenes with Helen Mirren drive the movie enough that you should be able to enjoy it for that alone.
6072	3	a	Sly, good-natured and fun, despite the presence of Tim Allen.
6073	9	a	At best, an interesting idea that seems to get lost in the cigarette smoke
6074	0	a	Philomena is a heartbreaking, tragic story. It's also a story of hope and faith that survives awful challenges.
6075	5	a	The first-act crash is admittedly spectacular and the ending adequately suspenseful, but what comes between is disappointingly routine and completely lacks the kind character complexity that made the original a thrill every step of the way.
6076	3	a	While storytelling speed seems unbearable in the opening scenes, a rhythm emerges that identifies thrilling directorial control and an appreciation for the brutality of love and trust.
6077	7	a	Apart from some song choices, it's is about as charmingly old-school as a Western animated feature has been in a long time.
6078	8	a	The worst kind of sequel. No original stars or director, just a cobbled-together script by one of the writers of Daddy Day Care. There should have been a big red flag when Eddie Murphy declined to appear.
6079	9	a	The only person who fares well here is York, and that's because his character is killed off just minutes into the picture.
6080	0	a	It would be hard to imagine a movie about drugs, depravity, and all-around bad behavior more electrifying than Trainspotting.
6081	3	a	Balances the specifics of the Greek-American culture with the transcendent universalities of family dynamics and makes you want to hug your own family.
6082	0	a	Surprisingly funny.
6083	3	a	A history lesson with more fire in the belly than most. It turns out that a feminist angle really can revive the same old Tudor psychodramas, thanks in large part to Ronan and Robbie's authoritative performance.
6084	4	a	The best thing about Arctic Tale is the vivid underwater cinematography, shot with such urgency and vibrancy that one might suspect a little CGI assistance has been employed.
6085	8	a	You've seen it before.
6086	5	a	That the supporting cast really needn't have bothered showing up is the closest Stallone gets to a decent joke.
6087	4	a	The late Shakur is especially impressive as the brighter of the duo -- a frazzled but infinitely patient character with a touching faith that somehow, if the pair just keeps plugging away, everything will turn out okay.
6088	0	a	A visual and emotional treat.
6089	1	a	Event movies as brilliantly executed as War of The Worlds come by very, very rarely indeed. Easily one of the finest disaster movies of all time.
6090	0	a	As an action film, as an auteurist vision, as a blockbuster, as a humanist statement...it's a masterpiece.
6091	1	a	An espionage thriller mixed with a revenge story wrapped in a character study about the world's favorite secret agent.
6092	4	a	Sharply written script in the dialogue department. But the chemistry element wanes and a heart element is nearly absent. Still, light, funny, always amusing. Kudos to Cusack.
6093	3	a	Weinstein's quiet study of Hasidic society is part of the film's appeal, but the story's crux would have potential in any context.
6094	5	a	This routine video-game spinoff borrows heavily from James Cameron action flicks and George Romero zombie epics but doesn't do much else.
6095	3	a	This gets progressively nastier and winds up with an impressive hellfire finish.
6096	0	a	Incredibly intense, unflichingly realistic and powerfully moving...One of the all-time great cinematic achievements...God bless Mel Gibson.
6097	2	a	A grand, sprawling tale of the civilizing of the west.
6098	9	a	The only good acting is done by the sharks.
6099	6	a	In Dragon Blade, East meets West in a murky, mediocre muddle.
6100	4	a	The originality and intelligence that made Smith's Clerks and Chasing Amy such refreshing pleasures are all but absent.
6101	1	a	A challenging piece of work, a film demanding that its viewers look past what's on its surface and find something deeper.
6102	1	a	This artful tale of survival against the elements - radiating terror and beauty - continues Peter Weir's fascination with characters trapped by worlds they didn't make.
6103	6	a	The movie does nothing special or surprising, but it doesn't particularly offend, either.
6104	5	a	If there is something new to be said about boxing, Bleed for This doesn't find it. Sucks all the energy out of a story that should have been a can't-miss.
6105	1	a	By far the best comedy of the summer, if not the year, it strikes comedy gold. It's that ridiculously good.
6106	3	a	The film has an unpolished intimacy, peeling back the surface exoticism of a cloistered faith to reveal the poignantly ordinary struggle of being an imperfect person in the world.
6107	3	a	An engaging blend of horror, comedy and fantasy meant for the entire family.
6108	3	a	Arriving amid the traditionally withered harvest of January releases, Orange County is peachy.
6109	6	a	It's hard to make the workings of the scientific mind dramatic, but unfortunately The Imitation Game doesn't even try. 
6110	2	a	Eminem does a credible roughed-up urban ghetto impression of James Dean
6111	0	a	Superficial shenanigans don't diminish its effect. It's a ridiculously funny barrage of taboo pranks, practical jokes and tests of both social altruism and Bam Margera's parents' patience - most of it failsafed so that the foolishness never subsides.
6112	3	a	A hugely entertaining, clever comic fairy tale. Most of the credit goes to Oscar nominee Amy Adams.
6113	5	a	This trashy film is a case of big guns and small brains.
6114	3	a	Worth seeing for Bening's brave and touching performance as an actress past her prime.
6115	4	a	It's fun to watch Jack Nicholson draw on great reservoirs of bile to play a mean SOB with an obsessive-compulsive disorder.
6116	3	a	Seems destined to join classic concert films like Woodstock and Gimme Shelter in the musical archives for its ability to capture the feel of the times and really make you feel like you were there.
6117	3	a	All this sounds rather grim, and indeed it is -- but this backward Heaven Can Wait is also, thanks to [director] Dukic's inventive imagination, surprisingly involving and ultimately sweet.
6118	4	a	Ultimately, Not Easily Broken is too sincere, and frankly, offers too much in the way of social comment to let its shortcomings outweigh its strengths.
6119	3	a	This summer picture has a brain as well as muscles.
6120	3	a	A playful, compassionate film, with a winning turn from Field. 
6121	4	a	... an exploitation film that because of the well-executed gimmicky snake angle will be ensured staying power as a cultish camp classic.
6122	3	a	Lynskey and Winslet are extraordinary actresses.
6123	6	a	Bicentennial Man's few simple pleasures can't make up for its shallow philosophizing.
6124	3	a	[Cranston's] craggy face and mellow baritone voice don't show signs of tiring audiences yet, and he has one quality few actors achieve at any age: He's eloquent in stillness and silence.
6125	5	a	It's a brilliant premise but wretchedly executed, as product placement becomes more important than the sly inherent satire of consumer conformity.
6126	0	a	A caring and compassionate portrait of a linguistics professor stricken with early onset Alzheimer's. carried home into our hearts by Julianne Moore's mesmerizing performance.
6127	6	a	There's little denying that this one of Lang's lesser films, perhaps not helped by the impoverished budget.
6128	1	a	"Even though the film boasts A-list talent both in front of and behind the camera, at heart this ""Dragon Tattoo"" is pulp that's just as nasty and visceral - and entertaining - as its predecessors. "
6129	3	a	Rango is an impressive and wonderfully strange film.
6130	2	a	While a commercial film is more about entertainment, this is more about, for want of a better term, art.
6131	6	a	The Break-Up is too badly fractured to be deemed repairable.
6132	0	a	Classic to the max, and with Davis, Henried, and those two cigarettes.
6133	10	a	"The film's lack of discretion robs the viewer of his or own conception of Christ's crucifixion. It is an exploitative disservice to ""the greatest story ever told,"" that reduces that illustrious narrative to an extended torture episode."
6134	3	a	An acerbic, wonderfully acted comedy-drama about family ties and mortality.
6135	6	a	Viewers are left with nearly two hours of dull, rather obvious gags.
6136	4	a	The narrative is unsatisfying as it leaves lots of unanswered questions.
6137	3	a	Fans get priority seating on the ride, but there's plenty of room for rookies to clamber aboard.
6138	1	a	Knocked Up has more heart than any of the Hollywood blockbusters released so far this year ... combined.
6139	3	a	Laura Linney and Philip Seymour Hoffman never disappoint, disappearing into roles which fit like gloves.
6140	4	a	Gets off to a slow start, but it's almost like Valkyrie had a Red Bull mid way through as everything is kicked up a notch
6141	3	a	When one of China's greatest directors dabbles in a genre of moviemaking he hasn't before, and ends up offering two magnificent martial arts films in a row, it's hard to complain.
6142	3	a	Minor Bertolucci, but achingly gorgeous.
6143	6	a	Brannon's slapstick comedy of errors works its tail off to entertain, but it's just too doggone long and short on laugh-out-loud moments.
6144	6	a	In the end Chappaquiddick will have to pass the same test as Kennedy's original version of the story-whether or not anyone will buy it. 
6145	9	a	It is phony, manipulative films like this that make people line up for Paul Blart: Mall Cop.
6146	4	a	For a long time, we're not even sure of the point of view: Is this a black comedy about murder or just a cynical morality play? The traveler in the foreign country is not sure, but he knows the film inspires thought.
6147	0	a	The Edge of Seventeen is a confident and emotive film about a teenager trying desperately to be comfortable with herself and falling short at times, hitting life's regular snags. 
6148	2	a	An interesting look at the Beatle who never was.
6149	9	a	Stuff like this should not be allowed to happen. There should be laws protecting the innocent. 
6150	0	a	Snakes on a Plane is kind of the ultimate B movie... One of the very best times I've ever had in a movie theater.
6151	3	a	Ready for a timely political comedy with Gene Hackman?
6152	3	a	Mr. Stevens has done a superb job of putting upon the screen the basic drama and shivering authenticity of the Frances Goodrich-Albert Hackett play, which in turn caught the magnitude of drama in the real-life diary of a Jewish girl.
6153	6	a	Star power can cover up a multitude of shortcomings in a film. Turns out stupidity isn't one of them.
6154	1	a	Written and directed by Martin McDonagh, and superbly acted by Frances McDormand and a handful of costars, the film is a splendidly mixed tonal cocktail and holiday-season highlight.
6155	4	a	Offbeat genial suburban gangster comedy delightfully directed by Jonathan Demme.
6156	3	a	This Hornet is a big, boisterous action-comedy - a funny, exciting and intentionally goofy summer movie that just happens to arrive in the middle of January.
6157	3	a	Menashe Lustig creates an endearing character, hapless and disheveled, barely scraping by, whose every attempt to do the right thing seems fated for failure.
6158	3	a	Director Peter Berg knows the difference between cartoon violence and the real stuff, and Hancock mixes both to good effect.
6159	4	a	Even though the film looks beautiful there are things that rubbed me the wrong way.
6160	4	a	...too schmaltzy to take seriously.
6161	8	a	Would seem sincere enough, but it's just a chain of ludicrous cliches of both the sports and religious variety.
6162	1	a	All of the actors clearly know they are there to support Moore. This is Alice's story and no one else's.
6163	3	a	Bolt marks Disney's long awaited re-emergence as a top-dog in the world of animation.
6164	5	a	A well-meaning, yet derivative, film of this sort is basically made or broken by the writing and portrayals of the characters, and both aspects are unsatisfactorily handled.
6165	9	a	You end up hoping the serial killer from See No Evil will wander over from a neighboring auditorium and pluck out their eyes just to make it stop.
6166	1	a	The movie itself is bipolar, full of mounting tension and hilarity like a classic screwball comedy, but it's all just barely skimming above a deep layer of darkness. 
6167	3	a	Although truly painful to watch at times, Monster nonetheless deserves to be seen, if only for Theron's startling tour-de-force performance.
6168	5	a	"Skeptics and scoffers will find ""Hereafter"" the funniest film of the year. Others, however, might simply yawn at its pretentious cravings, funereal pace, and murky intentions. "
6169	9	a	A transparent excuse for a constant parade of topless females eager to assume a compromising position. The only thing missing was a cheesy porn soundtrack.
6170	6	a	Like Tripp, Failure to Launch has a good heart but would be better off moving out of familiar territory.
6171	4	a	A one joke movie but Streisand and Hoffman make that one joke enjoyable.
6172	6	a	What's bizarre is how Penn idealizes and never questions this self-destructive, totally egocentric, romanticized adventurer.
6173	3	a	This movie really is for the whole family. It's funny, it has some really cool creatures and special effects, a heart-warming story and even a very slick ending, tied directly into one of those super-fan convention halls.
6174	2	a	Whatever else it is -- however flawed we find it -- The Passion of the Christ is a work of art.
6175	0	a	[The punchy] theatrical opening... doesn't so much lead viewers into the film as it injects them.
6176	5	a	...the sort of B-actor-driven comedic train wreck that David Spade used to dryly mock while doing his 'Hollywood Minute' on Saturday Night Live
6177	4	a	This effort soundly delivers the inconvenient truth to the generation who'll inherit it.
6178	5	a	There's a fine line between fragile sensitivity and wimpishness, and Ben Whishaw tramples all over it. He is the drippiest British actor since the Merchant Ivory heyday of James Wilby.
6179	3	a	...a twisted and sinister film with a payoff worth the price of admission.
6180	3	a	First Reformed is [Paul Schrader's] first screenplay to reach the screen unscathed in a decade, and shows an artist strengthened by the fight.
6181	9	a	Hello, Deedles. Terrible to meet you.
6182	3	a	A dark comedy teens will love.
6183	6	a	It quickly becomes a by-the-book, overly-simplified look at a quintet of single moms who find common ground coping with the challenges of raising middle-school age children and finding romance.
6184	3	a	Enjoying this wondrous wisp of a something is easy, describing it is hard. Luckily, Charlyne Yi is an enchantress.
6185	4	a	Bening can elevate even the dullest flicks to a higher level. You might even say, to paraphrase another noted Liverpudlian, she takes a bad movie and makes it better. 
6186	5	a	Keanu Reeves struggles to bring any life to this lugubrious, gloomily lit mythical tale about a group of outcast samurai soldiers. Slower than the queue at a ticket machine, it's only when the swords finally start swinging that the film really kicks in.
6187	4	a	It's about the blank spaces in teenage heads and lives, and what they do to fill them.
6188	3	a	Made from obvious formulas and pulp novel conflicts, but strongly acted and well crafted.
6189	2	a	Audiences these days need to be reminded that the road to the worst films is often paved with noble ambitions.
6190	4	a	The whole plot is incoherent, and it's depicted almost entirely through montages and crossfades.
6191	1	a	Cage can be loopy, weird and at the same time sympathetic -- crucial to our response to this character -- and Herzog draws one of his better performances here.
6192	4	a	Tim Story's film wears you down until you relent and say, yes, I like these people and it's fun to watch them all have such a good time.
6193	5	a	Jenkins is a bit too McDreamy to play the geeky underdog, and adult viewers will be nostalgic for the chubby, bucktoothed and truly dorky cast of The Goonies.
6194	4	a	Watching this film is about as cutting-edge as buying a Clash T-shirt at Wal-Mart.
6195	6	a	Basically a lower-end HBO movie that somehow made it to theaters, Love Ranch satisfies only as a showcase for [Helen] Mirren's well-established skills.
6196	7	a	Preposterous characters lurching through painfully contrived scenarios.
6197	2	a	This is a film that gives off a rich aroma of intellectual pursuit, but cannot digest the full intellectual and mystical meal it has cooked.
6198	1	a	Maryam is more timely now than ever.
6199	6	a	Its failures are spectacularly highlighted by its overwhelming ambition.
6200	0	a	The Kings Of Summer is a brilliant, endearing and engaging coming of age comedy, not only the funniest film of the year, but also the best film of the year to date.
6201	2	a	Jackson himself seems to miss the forest of the story for the literal trees.
6202	4	a	It's impossible to resist all the honey and nostalgia served here. Pooh and the gang will make you reminisce, laugh and cry in this delightful film. [Full review in Spanish]
6203	6	a	Moviegoers who complain about what a shaky camera does to their innards should pack antacids for this one.
6204	3	a	"Anyone looking for a ""serious"" movie featuring this creature will be disappointed. Approach The Predator for what it is -- a self-aware riff on classic B-movies -- and it's a reasonably enjoyable way to kill two hours."
6205	3	a	It's an oblique film, so quiet that at times it seems barely more than a whisper. But don't mistake that for fragility. It boasts a hard, clear voice.
6206	7	a	After the film ends, it's Philomena's story that sticks. Director Stephen Frears and company should be given credit only for staying out of the real Philomena's way.
6207	6	a	Every irony is signaled a little too obviously.
6208	0	a	The film presents justice as a moving target and dares us to actively pursue it en route to a greater good.
6209	6	a	Pretty people. Pretty scenery. Pretty bland. 
6210	4	a	Taking Woodstock could have used a bit more old-fashioned Ang Lee brooding and torment and a bit less forced joy.
6211	4	a	The weak storyline hovers over a scene while foraging for material and then flits off to a new situation. Without a strong narrative, the movie tends to drone on.
6212	3	a	Fascinating and thrilling, The Imitation Game keeps you gripped by always offering a reminder of what's at stake, as well as exploring the mind of a brilliant but unfairly treated war hero who should never be forgotten.
6213	10	a	To devote an entire feature film to making fun of another film's universally acknowledged gay subtext seems to me good cause for said filmmakers to have a sit-down with their muse, because somebody's been sleeping on the job.
6214	0	a	With inevitable debt to Fellini, Sorrentino's nods as reverential as they are wry.
6215	4	a	Despite some crackerjack work from Cranston, this story of agent Robert Mazur's infiltration of the Colombian drug cartels often feels rushed and perfunctory.
6216	2	a	Almost an unofficial sequel to The King's Speech, but at least this one has a sense of humor. [Full review in Spanish]
6217	3	a	Christopher Robin is a re-imagining full of heart and soul that, like the best Disney features, has something of value to offer audiences of all ages.
6218	3	a	It just may inspire a few younger moviegoers to read Stevenson's book, which is a treasure in and of itself.
6219	6	a	Any humor was bound to be a case of diminishing returns since the more you see of this bear, the less shocking it becomes.
6220	4	a	It's a huge ensemble and a vast sociopolitical canvas with which Sayles is playing here, and, like all his movies, it's quite absorbing as it's happening.
6221	9	a	Cusack and Brody are painful to watch in their ill-suited roles.
6222	0	a	It's about more than the gimmick, and The Artist will be calling to you, entrancing you and making you feel the love. 
6223	6	a	Neither Johansson nor Portman convince.
6224	4	a	When you add up the film's larks -- young women intent on forging their own pleasures, African-American cops, and gay marriage -- you have a vision of the America waiting for Trump's last hurrah.
6225	7	a	Sayles lets the befuddlements and ordinary complications of life take its course like a winding, sunlit stream.
6226	4	a	It's equal parts creepy, campy, funny, and tedious.
6227	5	a	Despite the fetching visuals and the charm of Jim Cummings as Pooh, there's nothing here that will make anyone forget the loveliness of Disney's original Pooh films.
6228	1	a	I loved Shari Springer Berman and Robert Pulcini's The Extra Man, but it's not going to be to everyone's liking.
6229	0	a	For the first time in months, this critical spectator feels like tossing his old hat into the air and weaving a joyous snake dance over the typewriter keys in celebration of Metro's triumphant Woman of the Year...
6230	3	a	A splendid example of a genre no longer much in fashion, the jungle adventure story.
6231	3	a	DuVernay's film is too effective on its own dramatic terms for it to be reduced simply to an allegory for Where We Are Today, yet it's also tremendously encouraging for anyone who wonders if there's any hope for change. 
6232	4	a	The set-up couldn't be better primed for tension, but director Brad Furman doesn't supply as much clammy suspense as you might hope.
6233	4	a	American Pastoral tries to be loyal in its adaptation, but the material is film-resistant and flat as cardboard.
6234	3	a	The economic signal is clear. War is money, but the media can't sit at the big table to profit from it anymore. 
6235	0	a	Not a superficial music video but a smart and compassionate dissection of superficiality, and of the alternating joys and disillusionments experienced by its audience.
6236	3	a	This theatrical whim is like a dessert so rich it's almost inedible but too irresistible to put down.
6237	1	a	Silver Linings Playbook paves a highly entertaining road to recovery for its characters - one you will be glad to have helped sponsor.
6238	1	a	A razor sharp, unfiltered exploration of recovery and reconciliation. 
6239	4	a	Falls short of its predecessor in almost every area, except perhaps acting.
6240	5	a	Spiffy-looking, well-intentioned but ultimately witless.
6241	5	a	Effects, including random head explosions and other bloody body parts, are state of the low art.
6242	1	a	A demanding film filled with complexities and meant for the discriminating viewer.
6243	6	a	Smith and sexy Mendes spar nicely, but they don't spark. In movies, that's the kiss of death.
6244	1	a	Sentimental fantasy that packs a visual punch.
6245	3	a	Interesting twist on the romantic triangle.
6246	3	a	A movie as compelling and unusual as its subject.
6247	0	a	Better than expected. McGregor and Atwell are a delight. Voice cast, especially Brad Garrett as Eeyore, is excellent. Better than director Forster's Finding Neverland.
6248	1	a	A groundbreaking gothic film whose creative camerawork and dark cinematography is still copied in the movies of today.
6249	0	a	The pain and hope and sense of loss are all there in Dern's eyes, in Woody's stolid willfulness, his shaky gait.
6250	7	a	An extravaganza of watch-checking.
6251	4	a	"This would have gone straight to video had it not been for the box-office success of ""The Passion of the Christ."
6252	3	a	Incredibly fun, incredibly entertaining, and worth watching in all respects.
6253	5	a	It's a tired opinion, but Seth MacFarlane really does only appeal to fans of Seth MacFarlane... of which, I imagine the number one fan is Seth MacFarlane.
6254	5	a	Inevitably exudes a kind of hand-me-down quality, the feeling of being a second-rate copy instead of a true original, at once too clever and not clever enough.
6255	2	a	Honest and frequently very funny even if the humor sometimes feels forced. Unspools like a younger, raunchier Woody Allen film, especially in light of its lovingly-shot NYC setting.
6256	9	a	Even the title card is garish
6257	5	a	The fright ultimately fizzles...
6258	3	a	The themes of oppression and greed are tied even more relevantly in 'Land of the Dead' than any of its predecessors.
6259	5	a	Anyone wanting to learn about the real Hitchcock will be disappointed - although Hopkins does get a gold star for a tongue-in-cheek impersonation of Alfred.
6260	1	a	The film begins to teeter slightly as it reaches its climax; it takes too long to unveil the many twists and surprises, but up to then, this is impeccable, enormously invigorating filmmaking.
6261	0	a	Not since Hitchcock has a director been so good at holding out their films' greatest secrets until the very end.
6262	6	a	One of the few films to maintain an air of stuffiness even while sharing intimate details of debauchery.
6263	4	a	A delightful example of a horror film that for the most part chugs along merrily, pressing all the modern-day fright-fest buttons, sustaining a just-so sense of gravitas.
6264	0	a	Superman II begins in midstream, and never looks back...
6265	3	a	The Way Back goes to great lengths for authenticity, which is ironic considering its source is dubious. This is old-school monumental filmmaking, without CGI tricks or many soundstage comforts for a dedicated cast. David Lean would probably approve.
6266	9	a	Silly nonsense.
6267	8	a	The time is certainly ripe for a scathing black comedy about our current political life -- something on the order of, say, Dr. Strangelove. Alas, American Dreamz is not that film. Not even close.
6268	3	a	Better story, better acting, better characters and better effects. All they need is to sort out the dialogue next time, and everyone's a winner.
6269	2	a	[Westfeldt a] better filmmaker than she is a movie star; the sharply observed comedy...would have been better served with Westfeldt in a supporting role, with the underutilized Kristen Wiig in the lead.
6270	6	a	made for kids with more bee puns than Carrot Top and Kenny Bania could ever imagine
6271	1	a	[LaBute] pulls the farce and the violence and the fantasies together with a deft touch and a sweetness rare in American films -- especially his.
6272	1	a	"Midnight in Paris"" makes you yearn for the time when brainy larks weren't a once-a-year occasion."
6273	6	a	A bloated sci-fi epic from Disney that's made watchable by swell effects, passable performances and those little dashes of humor that reassure us that the filmmakers know this is all a lark.
6274	1	a	Cooper's much better than usual, while the always-great Lawrence is particularly fantastic.
6275	1	a	Skyfall is a rollicking good Bond and Daniel Craig's best.
6276	5	a	Payne just doesn't make bad movies. Until now.
6277	1	a	...has the advantage of Fred Astaire and Judy Garland in the lead roles, Irving Berlin numbers throughout, and hats upon hats upon hats.
6278	6	a	Mostly, the movie is filled with scenes where the soldier people argue until somebody says, 'What's that sound?,' and then some horrible monster comes out and tries to eat them.
6279	4	a	Girls Trip proves that a good laugh can cure anything, including the common case of a familiar script. [Full review in Spanish]
6280	5	a	Ready Player One might not be Spielberg's worst film, but it is his most impersonal.
6281	5	a	Despite the potential for humour from the couples and their relationship problems, the script relies on lame situation jokes.
6282	2	a	Timberlake runs away with the movie, earning retribution for the straight-to-video disaster of Edison Force.
6283	3	a	As vastly expensive pieces of set tumble everywhere one cannot help but consider that white elephants, whilst they mat be a burden to keep, are splendid things to look at.
6284	2	a	Wicked, but it works.
6285	7	a	The best thing The Edge of Love could do for you is to send you back to Thomas's poetry. Dash this folderol. Open Under Milk Wood.
6286	3	a	Nurse Betty is a corker.
6287	6	a	Filled with enough stock characters and B-film plotlines for a dozen mediocre Westerns.
6288	2	a	There are nice bits throughout, and your heart can't help but go out to these impassioned young lovers whom you know are doomed. But Bright Star is too often tarnished by the ordinary.
6289	3	a	Even non-Beatles fans -- myself included -- should give this one a try.
6290	4	a	Someday, maybe someday soon, someone in Hollywood is going to make a genuinely great movie about television as a metaphor for America.
6291	0	a	Javier Bardem steals the show as perhaps the most unnerving screen villain of the year, a monster who ups the ante in terms of tension by holding a cattle gun to his victims' heads while flipping a coin to determine who lives and who dies.
6292	4	a	If only the screenplay had taken its time to fully and organically flesh out its characters and their emotions, The Curious Case of Benjamin Button would have been a much more emotionally powerful experience.
6293	4	a	Okay, so maybe Kelly Fremon Craig's The Edge Of Seventeen isn't the second coming of the teen movie. But it's well-observed and even touching, and those are never bad qualities.
6294	4	a	The Ring has enough frights to satisfy the big crowds
6295	3	a	Twohy constantly dares us to guess, only to throw the scent elsewhere, get us accustomed to our new idea, and then throw it back right where it started.
6296	3	a	It's raw, it's intense and it's very engrossing.
6297	7	a	The trouble with the movie is that there's nothing to Muriel but her false dreams: We never quite glimpse the woman they're hiding.
6298	5	a	Promises to be a masterpiece, only to succumb to Hollywood mediocrity -- just like its director.
6299	4	a	Big screen sudser with Hudson and Bacall leading the tears.
6300	1	a	I like it. There is a freedom to watching stunts that are this crude, this fast-paced and this insane.
6301	4	a	Humanistic sci-fi from director Mike Cahill, insofar as it sympathizes with the human longings for both understanding and transcendent mystery.
6302	3	a	the film works best on that deliciously, subversively subliminal level, twisting its metaphor of exploited underclasses
6303	4	a	"If there were ever a movie that deserved that label ""For Fans Only"", this is it."
6304	2	a	...it's not the character of McCandless...but the supporting cast and characters who bring the story to life.
6305	5	a	"An outlandishly crude farce that crossbreeds Chuck Jones's classic Baby Bugs Bunny with In Living Color's absurd ""The Head Detective"" to dismally predictable results."
6306	0	a	Rooney, Noomi?I love both 'Dragon Tattoo' girls.
6307	3	a	Walken has rarely delivered such an earthy, physical performance, and his character gives as well as he takes.
6308	1	a	"James White"" gets up close and personal in often discomfiting ways, but it's never exploitative or glib. It hits the highs, and the rock bottoms, and all the damnable stuff in between."
6309	3	a	The last scene alone justifies the film and Leo McCarey's reputation
6310	10	a	Some folks reach for nirvana, but the Wayans Brothers -- writer/director Keenen Ivory, writer/star Marlon, and writer/star Shawn -- aim for the nadir, and man oh man, have they reached it.
6311	6	a	In a choice of lesser evils, you could do a whole lot worse... While it never climbs very high, it survives because we know how much further it could fall.
6312	4	a	Desk Set is quaintly funny and has a few memorable moments...it's ultimately harmless fun with a gossamer message about technology and gender roles.
6313	6	a	Tax forms have more emotional content.
6314	4	a	Logan Lucky is a hillbilly heist caper brimming with good natured humor.
6315	0	a	Most likely the first horror film to express something beyond simple chills and thrills.
6316	4	a	If the praise seems faint, it's nevertheless praise -- this Flight of the Phoenix may not soar, but it manages to get itself airborne. 
6317	6	a	Eventually peddles the same old ass-backwards messages, equating physical beauty with goodness, and positing that a woman's greatest dream is that a hunk will materialize out of thin air and make her a contented homemaker and wife.
6318	2	a	It knows what it is, almost mindless and totally kick-arse. In fact, it's my favorite of the Crankporter flicks.
6319	6	a	The ambition is evident throughout, but the execution just doesn't have enough energy to sustain it. THUNDERBALL is very sluggish.
6320	9	a	If the movie's witless, it's also pretty harmless.
6321	6	a	Has an on-again-off-again humorous way, but lacks a great story to hold onto.
6322	6	a	Robert Duvall is a worker drone in a futuristic nightmare, man. Until he stops taking his pills and sees how groovy the world can be. Trippy.
6323	6	a	Contains very few real scares and even less of a story.
6324	6	a	The raunch itself may be enough for a teen audience. But The To Do List is no American Pie.
6325	2	a	A smaller work in Allen's stable
6326	2	a	Oh Bright Star, wouldst thou were a great film... but thou art not. Thou art good but bitsy.
6327	2	a	A solid but flawed film--Freeman's charmingly disarming portrayal keeps it real.
6328	4	a	"Diversions don't entirely distract from a sense that we've seen ""Early Man"" before. Cheeky references to Manchester United and ""Jurassic pork"" only go so far."
6329	0	a	In the end, the shark is a MacGuffin necessary for the men to bond and test themselves against what they fear most--their own mortality.
6330	4	a	Sacha Gervasi's muddled but endearing biopic of/homage to The Master of Suspense.
6331	1	a	Certainly Weinstein captures the complex culture of this ultra-Orthodox community... That sense of a community, and how an oddball like Menashe learns to live within it, is what makes Menashe so fascinating and universal.
6332	6	a	A sporadically diverting thriller that has the personality of a Diet Coke ad.
6333	1	a	The most visually spectacular of all Roman Empire epics.
6334	1	a	One of Luis Bunuel's greatest and funniest films, and the winner of a Best Foreign Film Oscar, The Discreet Charm of the Bourgeoisie is a brilliant surrealistic joke about a group of friends whose attempts to dine are continually thwarted.
6335	4	a	Shults has crafted a very admirable and challenging piece of cinema. But it's also one that enthralls while never truly ensnaring the audience or their fears.
6336	1	a	A fun , surprisingly smart ride that is also true to the spirit of Asimov's more thoughtful and low-key work.
6337	4	a	The film may be corny and a little gauche but there is no arguing with its sentiments.
6338	4	a	Barnyard isn't genius, but it isn't cloying either. It's aggressively entertaining and, at times, unexpectedly touching.
6339	1	a	the fact that the film ends on an image of sublime sentimentality and gets away with it scott free is enough to make it worth seeing twice, just to appreciate how it got there.
6340	4	a	On many levels, the details of the conflict -- convincingly staged in New Mexico -- make for riveting viewing but there are major flaws in the film.
6341	0	a	A dust-bowl Pulp Fiction, the movie is bloody, suspenseful, unnerving and, not incidentally, hilarious. The best Coen Bros. drama, without the twitchy mannerisms of Fargo.
6342	4	a	The taboo-flouting director of the torture-porn Hostel movies has tapped into his inner Hufflepuff for what has to be one of the oddest career change-ups in Hollywood memory. Odder still, it kind of works.
6343	3	a	An Unexpected Journey offers an unparalleled visual spectacle
6344	1	a	This is a powerful film that packs a punch to the stomach.
6345	4	a	This is another likeable, affectionate family [Aardman] animation that benefits from the human touch.
6346	2	a	Delightfully outrageous, Black Snake Moan is an explosive mixture of sex, race and down-South swamp water.
6347	5	a	Hardly Mr. Bond's finest hour.
6348	3	a	reels the viewer in like a black hole, like a quicksand hourglass.
6349	5	a	Spoiler alert: Everybody dies.
6350	2	a	Bounces easily between edgy humour and sweet sentimentality.
6351	3	a	It bounces seamlessly from the present to the past and back again while juggling magic, science, trickery and lies, creating a mood that transcends the story.
6352	2	a	The movie becomes more than just a story about the music, of course, as McTeer's musicologist comes to understand and appreciate the locals' way of life... and maybe there'll be a little romance along the way?
6353	5	a	Its noble intentions are undermined by syrupy, movie-of- the-week direction.
6354	0	a	"By ""Monster's"" end, nothingness replaces Aileen Wuornos' ferocity - evidence of exhaustive efforts from Patty Jenkins and Oscar-winner Charlize Theron to emphasize this serial killer's fraying sanity, not her crimes' sensationalism."
6355	4	a	It's enjoyable and fun to watch, but just barely touches the surface of its own narrative.
6356	3	a	A true thinking man's thrill ride.
6357	0	a	A brilliantly understated romantic comedy.
6358	1	a	With terrific acting performances and a bygone era that sparks to life with impressive filmmaking, Carol crafts a memorable romance gift-wrapped for the holiday.
6359	1	a	The most grown-up film of the trilogy. ... Instead of giving us characters who find happiness by rediscovering their youth, they show us the folly of resisting adulthood.
6360	3	a	Director Roger Donaldson has a great command of the narrative, going out of his way to find fresh approaches for bringing trepidation to a story with an outcome that every audience member knows going in.
6361	3	a	It's an extraordinary thing for a narrative film to successfully observe its characters like they aren't of its own creation - to make them utterly alive in front of us.
6362	5	a	Also the Predictables, the Forgettables and they kinda look like the Anabolic Steroidables...
6363	1	a	Mendes' approach to action is classical and elegant - no manic editing and blurry unintelligible images here - but what makes the movie special is the attention he pays his actors. 
6364	2	a	Color me impressed.
6365	1	a	Almost the best movie of the year.
6366	3	a	A film that criticizes society and the way it focuses on vanity and other superfluous things. [Full review in Spanish]
6367	1	a	Still Alice is as powerful as it is crushing. Ms. Moore delivers a performance that will endure.
6368	0	a	The twistiest thriller since Memento.
6369	7	a	Vulgar and tawdry, it turns a cyber-crime into cinematic chaos.
6370	1	a	... tenuous and beautiful interaction between Cage and Lohman.
6371	4	a	"Hitchcock"" is an amusing lark, but the clumsy way it dissects the director is for the birds."
6372	5	a	It's impossible to shake the impression that Barnyard was written by idiots. Why else would the male cows have udders?
6373	3	a	It's a well-toned blend of surrealism, science fiction, horror and spiritual mystery that would never have survived Hollywood's script-by-committee attitude.
6374	4	a	A nice mix of science-fiction and action-adventure with a little romance thrown in.
6375	3	a	Shanghai Noon will be Wilson's breakthrough role.
6376	3	a	Nebraska is an absolutely enchanting film, so funny, so touching, ringing true - for me right up there with the year's best.
6377	5	a	Drenched in adrenaline, veiled in violence, 'The Expendables' really is. Expendable, I mean.
6378	5	a	A confusing action-drama that, despite being a box office titan in China, lands here with a dull thud.
6379	1	a	[A] ridiculously entertaining nostalgia exercise...Radio Days emerged from a highly fertile period for [Woody] Allen, and the film bubbles with creativity and Allen hallmarks. [Blu-ray]
6380	4	a	If you like slapstick, see it.
6381	5	a	Max Payne joins Fox's steadily increasing roster of entirely ineffective action pictures, alongside such underwhelming disappointments as Hitman and Live Free or Die Hard...
6382	5	a	An austere film-making exercise, wallowing in anguish and despair. There's a reason why it was rejected by both Netflix and Amazon.
6383	5	a	Cutting humour but the film fails to take that final leap.
6384	5	a	Hong Kong action star Jet Li meets rap rough-rider DMX in a piece of action trash whose gloss can't outshine its flaws.
6385	3	a	Addams Family Values turns out to be both a trick and a treat.
6386	6	a	Overly corny, this feel-good musical is delightful in its naivety, even for the time.
6387	6	a	A rom-com fairy tale so tepid and well behaved that watching it feels like being stuck in traffic as giddy joy-riders in the opposite lane break the speed limit.
6388	3	a	It is a beautiful film with very few surprises up its sleeve, but you won't really care since you'll be mesmerized by what you're seeing on screen.
6389	2	a	. Matchstick Men might be a lesser Catch Me If You Can or Ocean's Eleven, but it's got a jazzy, understated style all of its own. It's one ride on which you will enjoy being taken.
6390	3	a	It's the last year of free time. The last year of hanging out. The last year to spend on simply living. Few movies have ever conveyed that sense so well.
6391	4	a	If you lapped up Beverly Hills Chihuahua, this canine caper about two siblings who turn a derelict hotel into a refuge for stray pooches will no doubt be the mutt's nuts.
6392	5	a	In terms of strict movie-making, Roll Bounce would have been better had it done more rolling along and less bouncing around.
6393	4	a	It's a movie where the subtler small scenes resonate more than the clunkier big ones.
6394	6	a	The same stuff you've seen in every other run of the mill, artificially sweetened date flick.
6395	7	a	There's no trust here from the director that the audience might be able to fathom the horrors of the Holocaust if the lines between good and bad aren't distinctly drawn.
6396	9	a	Dumb comedy should be cited for bad taste.
6397	5	a	Camp is tricky. The very real problem in making a movie that's so bad that it's good is that you can easily overachieve and create a genuine stinker by mistake.
6398	3	a	It has resonance-the violence and destruction addresses the questions that bedevil every maudlin old drinker. Why is every town getting to look the same? Why do formerly fun-loving friends become dour middle-aged middle-managers?
6399	6	a	A kiss-up rather than a real examination of the rapper's life.
6400	3	a	A hell of an action movie, an admission that makes me feel a little guilty.
6401	7	a	...this is a masterpiece compared to anything Rob Schneider has put out only it suffers from the same form of stereotyping.
6402	1	a	Sharp, funny, and acerbic...Movies that are as truthful and observant as this one are rare.
6403	7	a	Travis dutifully pastes the story-shards together, but he and the actors are hamstrung by a script that's so busy piling on the twists that it never pauses to consider what they mean.
6404	1	a	Wild and often hilarious. I bet it gets even better the second time around 
6405	3	a	...an almost perversely uplifting celebration of a very strange and uncommonly charming young man, an Icarus who died by his own folly but in the process grazed heaven.
6406	3	a	Visually and emotionally stunning.
6407	7	a	An intense, harrowing drama betrayed by a campy Rosamund Pike performance.
6408	6	a	The premise of Jason X is silly but strangely believable.
6409	0	a	A powerful film made with minimal means, it's a story of poor people on the fringes of society, done without sentimentality or condescension but with wicked humor.
6410	4	a	After a clumsy and over-complicated beginning -- I wonder how many children will know what a mastiff is? -- this becomes a lot of fun, largely thanks to a wonderful voice performance from Eddie Izzard as a fading rock star.
6411	3	a	Raunchy but tender comedy about sex and parenthood.
6412	3	a	A real-life May-December romance, movingly told and acted. Bening and Bell give performances to cherish.
6413	4	a	"De Palma doesn't know the meaning of the word ""subtle"" -- every scene in Snake Eyes uses a brash, in-your-face approach that works until the disappointing climax."
6414	4	a	Coasts on the charisma of its three stars.
6415	6	a	The Last Witch Hunter ends up crumbling into another generic showdown of murky fantasy effects and snatched artifacts, with a final shot that is literally framed around a door to possible sequels.
6416	6	a	Corn doesn't grow any higher than this male bonding tribute to testosterone.
6417	3	a	"Eminem plays a guy named ""Rabbit,"" and he doesn't get any respect. Maybe going by the name ""Rabbit"" isn't the route to respect, yo."
6418	6	a	[T]he culture of juvenile pranks and misdemeanors and a nightly hoedown that combines a Vegas casino and a cattle-town country bar is more appropriate for older kids...
6419	3	a	"Still Alice"" is much too clear-eyed to hold out false hope, but it's a moving testimonial to going down with grace."
6420	1	a	I came out of the film sure of only two things: It will divide audiences more than any comedy this year, and it will reward a second viewing.
6421	4	a	The fight choreography of Donnie Yen is truly a pulse pounding ballet of whirling swordplay.
6422	5	a	Like shave ice without the topping, this cinematic snow cone is as innocuous as it is flavorless.
6423	4	a	Not Easily Broken is not easily dismissed. For one thing, the cast is excellent, and for another, its intentions are serious and generous.
6424	8	a	A repulsive combination of dry textbook history and pandering melodrama.
6425	4	a	Boyer makes for a fine lovable louse, giving the film gusto.
6426	2	a	It's been awhile since horror has been so nicely placed in a social context. The Ring is a gotta-see for those wanting to get creeped out.
6427	4	a	Mercilessly padded, the movie drags us through ages of all-too-familiar territory.
6428	5	a	Unrelenting in the number of ways it can get its one joke wrong.
6429	6	a	It's weird, but it's not really funny.
6430	5	a	Whatever film you've imagined...is better than what the film actually is.
6431	4	a	Together writer-director Danny Verete's three tales comprise a powerful and reasonably fulfilling gestalt.
6432	4	a	It's all directed with a eye to coarse, tongue in cheek caricature that's an uncomfortable fit with the material and undermines the lowbrow fun.
6433	3	a	Definitely a planet worth a visit.
6434	1	a	It's impossible not to be moved.
6435	6	a	As a hotly anticipated comeback, it feels like a slightly dippy, ultimately disposable warm-up of a director whose brains, chops and judicious taste we need more than ever.
6436	0	a	Bond. James Bond is back.
6437	6	a	Didn't I read somewhere that Soderbergh had retired from filmmaking? This would be a perfect time for him to keep that promise.
6438	4	a	What screamed a ridiculous idea or vanity project when you first read or head about it is the exact opposite - a well thought out and realised film which never thinks too much of itself.
6439	4	a	Jessica Alba in a bikini comes pretty close to being enough entertainment for the price of the film.
6440	2	a	The season could do with more grinning, spinning, un-self-important, happy-to-be-B throwback movies like this one.
6441	4	a	Sumptuous and self-indulgent, Sorrentino's latest is a Fellini-like feast for the eyes.
6442	4	a	In its tone and style, plays like a companion piece to All the President's Men.
6443	2	a	Makes skillful use of documentary footage to relate what happened in the streets of Chicago, culminating in what was routinely described at the time as 'a police riot.'
6444	3	a	The movie may consist of formulaic elements, but it excels on the strength of its cast and the sincerity of its message.
6445	2	a	A great handbook on how to cop ideas from the best spy/ action/ adventure flicks
6446	3	a	Foremost is the very adventure of experiencing an Altman film, his failures are better than most directors's successes.
6447	1	a	It doesn't always proceed as smoothly as some of Hitchcock's best films, but it is never anything less than grandly entertaining. 
6448	4	a	"What makes this unhinged, wildly self-conscious comedy-adventure more than a two-hour gimmick is an inspired vocal performance by Verbinski's ""Pirates of the Caribbean"" star, Johnny Depp."
6449	1	a	Wonder what Matt Damon did to piss these guys off?
6450	1	a	The Incredibles is the finest of Pixar combined with the best parts of Spider-Man, Superman and Batman...plus it's pretty damn funny too.
6451	6	a	Manages to be engaging, even though the plot is badly underdeveloped.
6452	1	a	A mannered, classical romance that replaces the original pulp identity of the novel at the time of its release with a gentle, affecting two-hander as the author surely envisioned it.
6453	0	a	This gorgeous story is an aching, haunting summer love that fills your heart with love. True to that summer love feeling, it's hard to shake this one. 
6454	6	a	Absurdist escapism in its most classic form.
6455	3	a	The story tends to meander but the kids' ups and downs are delicately observed and the performances, especially from Roberts, are never less than believable.
6456	4	a	Shults clutches nerves deftly. Until the horror ends being a excuse to clog and it exposes that the tension between the characters doesn't worry as much as the outer threat. [Full review in Spanish]
6457	7	a	As standardized as the exam it seeks to debunk, and nearly as tedious.
6458	3	a	Proving Tom Hanks is still Acting King, the character-driven Larry Crowne should make a splash with the date crowd. 
6459	3	a	Confusing panache and show-off dialogue slows the blastoff, but this escapist journey turns into high adventure with a rather special style.
6460	6	a	It's still pretty mindless, but, really, what did you expect from a bunch of zombies?
6461	3	a	It's that rare family movie -- genuine and sweet without relying on animation or dumb humor.
6462	2	a	Movie's strong suits are great acting and great location photography, not its structure or its self-destructive central character.
6463	5	a	The bones of a good idea for a conspiracy thriller lie buried in the corpse of Vantage Point. It feels more like a movie with a personality disorder.
6464	10	a	Every once in a while, a film limps into theaters so stitched together, it's a wonder it doesn't rip apart in the projector. Jonah Hex is such a film.
6465	7	a	This is about as bleak as these things get.
6466	9	a	Witless slapstick with leering, obnoxious man-child.
6467	9	a	[Man of the Year] ends up feeling as phony the process it so desperately wants to skewer.
6468	5	a	The latest, most ambitious and perhaps least comprehensible video game adaptation in recent memory.
6469	6	a	...a rather crude, strongly self-indulgent, and often repetitious comedy that, nonetheless, was largely amiable and good-natured.
6470	4	a	A cheerfully reprehensible bloodfest, spiced up by Verhoeven's imaginative mayhem.
6471	5	a	Writer/director Shana Feste is clearly indebted to the Oscar-winning Crazy Heart and Robert Altman's epic Nashville, but the script all too often stumbles into mediocre soap-opera territory.
6472	3	a	There's a self-aware feel to the period pageantry, the alternatingly seductive and kinetic cinematography, and the actor's showcase this ramshackle contraption has been held together with spit and bailing wire to be.
6473	0	a	Yes, the marketing presents it as a big broad comedy -- and it certainly is -- but it's also a unique and involving tale of two outsiders who together find a way to get on with life after it has dealt them some bad hands.
6474	6	a	Any film with Hamilton is worth a watch, just for that.
6475	3	a	Benefiting from Polanski's skewed vision, the film takes on a quality of comic weirdness rarely present in Hammer's contemporary output.
6476	4	a	Alien invasion thriller too scary for young kids.
6477	3	a	Finely acted and measured in its subtly faith-based approach, Rodrigo Garcia's Mother and Child does not quite escape the limitations of its soapy genre ...
6478	5	a	Twaddle and hooey driven by a self-absorbed blonde
6479	8	a	Dominion is indeed a plodfest, and though it's not as garish as Mr. Harlin's version, it's way too dire for its own good.
6480	7	a	While the points it hammers home with all the subtlety of a Vivid Video girl's come-on are anything but pointless, the film begins an inexorable slide into outright silliness by the third act.
6481	6	a	A story that spins out of control and lacks a comedic focus.
6482	6	a	One of those thrillers that pivots around the question of how daring -- or how focus-group cautious -- we suspect the filmmakers will turn out to be.
6483	1	a	With one of the best ensemble casts of any film this year, it's audacious, enthralling and uproarious.
6484	2	a	...in its own right it works well enough most of the time to pass an entertaining couple of hours.
6485	3	a	Fun caper flick with great Redford and Poitier rapport.
6486	0	a	It's outrageous satire, bruisingly funny slapstick and - while never too snooty to stoop for lowdown laughs - deliciously smart besides.
6487	2	a	It was so refreshing to see a story told about true love that contained honest chemistry. Ben Wishaw should be nominated for Oscar right now.
6488	4	a	Fails to earn credibility and it fails to engage us.
6489	6	a	It doesn't have that extra spark required to make it anything but instantly forgettable.
6490	4	a	I give credit to satirists Parker and Stone for having the wherewithal to slaughter sacred cows and show that hypocrisy is evident on both sides of the political aisle.
6491	6	a	With a little more conflict, Paris Can Wait might have done a better job of keeping its audience locked in, but it is so tension-free that you begin to feel like you're watching a travel documentary hosted by people who don't know you're there.
6492	4	a	There's something rock about the film's messy, nostalgic imperfection.
6493	2	a	"Bolt's"" basic story is nothing too original, but its underpinnings and flourishes are smart and inventive."
6494	3	a	Don't expect investigative reporting.... Tupac: Resurrection is a trip through a man's head.
6495	5	a	Petrie deadens any possible momentum or energy; he can't even make one of our greatest actors, Gene Hackman, appear presidential.
6496	6	a	Watching a Sam Mendes film is like sitting in a room while all the air is being sucked out.
6497	3	a	I'm not sure how much replay this film will get, but a first viewing is awfully satisfying-though it makes the audience work a little harder than they're accustomed.
6498	3	a	Amid all the darkness in our world, Hello, My Name is Doris is a simple, delightful little human comedy. You know, like life itself.
6499	4	a	Despite the idiotic people, the absurd level of coincidence, the spotty special effects and the lazy ending, I still liked Jurassic Park III.
6500	4	a	A Japanese story famous for its illustrations now comes to the big screen with a touch of mystery and a lot of action for kids and adults. [Full review in Spanish]
6501	2	a	The Eastwood magic still works. This is not his best film but it is still a good one.
6502	3	a	In this single film, [Sayles] includes more vividly drawn female characters than I've seen in a year's worth of major releases.
6503	3	a	This is grand, half-crazy fun, and Jackman and Bale are committed to their parts: Genuine madness glints in their eyes.
6504	8	a	The Great Beauty boils over with shapeless disdain, aimed everywhere but where it should be
6505	4	a	That the movie succeeds about half of the time is tribute to its mature recognition of sexual cause and effect.
6506	6	a	Ellis and company miss out on so many opportunities for awesomeness, it's almost depressing. 
6507	0	a	"Mystic River"" is teeming with various elements that flow together to create one of the finest movies of the year."
6508	1	a	Wow, indeed.
6509	2	a	"Crimson Peak"" is the perfect Halloween treat, a little scary, a little sweet and unquestionably haunting."
6510	0	a	A lush and vibrant masterpiece about first love set amid the warm, sunny skies, gentle breezes and charming, tree-lined roads of northern Italy.
6511	3	a	Since its story inspired every mainstream fantasy right up to Avatar, John Carter may seem a little old-fashioned, but it's a solid piece of fantasy entertainment that's equal parts corny and poignant.
6512	4	a	Valkyrie may not be awards bait but it is a solid, at times gripping, thriller that wrings every ounce of drama out of what is, at heart, a pulsating tale of the courage and idealism of some undone by the cowardice and politics of others.
6513	3	a	"A quiet character study, ""The Rider"" is almost documentary-like in its approach."
6514	5	a	It will please no one, but at least it tried not to be dull.
6515	2	a	The stony performances don't really matter, and neither does the blunt dialog. But it's still great fun.
6516	2	a	The hippie mindset is that either you're with them or you're not, and similarly Taking Woodstock asks that you ride along its loose, laid-back vibe or start flinging mud.
6517	3	a	A cinematic slam-dunk.
6518	6	a	Feels more like a TV movie for the Women's Television Network than a feature film.
6519	1	a	Captivating and multifaceted. Written and directed by Sean Penn, the film is a haunting and moving experience, highlighted by evocative original music by Eddie Vedder.
6520	3	a	Boasted by great performances, emotionally effective story beats, and an overall heartwarming nature, Love, Simon will make you cry and cheer by the end.
6521	3	a	Meet The Fockers is a fine sequel; not surpassing the original, but clearly putting forth more of an effort than most follow-ups do into the script department. 
6522	1	a	Into the Wild represents Penn's most assured and affecting work yet as director and screenwriter, in the wake of The Indian Runner, The Crossing Guard and The Pledge.
6523	1	a	Alfie is a total knockout of a movie: stylish, well-crafted and well-performed. It also manages simultaneously to be a cautionary tale for Casanovas everywhere.
6524	3	a	Knightley here gives a mature performance that matches Cumberbatch's in commitment.
6525	1	a	Who knew that the director who once gave the world Hostel Part II could conjure up on the most magical family fantasies in years?
6526	9	a	Miami Vice isn't just a terrible movie. It's a terrible movie that looks like absolute crap.
6527	5	a	Whole chunks of necessary explanation feel like they've been left on the cutting room floor
6528	4	a	He may be a reconstituted robot, but this little cyber-kid's got some real heart.
6529	0	a	This is the towering, unconventional power of a true artist.
6530	6	a	Ridiculous scripting and a geeky, grating performance by the needy, too-old-for-this-role Osment sets the teeth on edge.
6531	1	a	Truly frightening and visually unique, this messy, challenging film is anchored by Tim Robbins' remarkable performance.
6532	5	a	should have been funnier with this title
6533	3	a	An attitude bazooka full of sex, drugs and raw language, yet so high on babies and family values that this must be the first R-rated film for both sleazoid slackers and earnest right-to-lifers.
6534	10	a	That the first film's primary target/model was Scream and that this one's is The Haunting says everything about its creative bankruptcy. 
6535	6	a	Unfortunately, like the murky visuals, the story is also muddled.
6536	2	a	By putting its focus on the friendship, Ralph Breaks the Internet breaks free from being just a bunch of Internet gags and becomes something far more rewarding.
6537	3	a	Effectively combines the maneuvers of the chess board with the unfathomable intricacies of the human heart.
6538	5	a	"There could be quite an active drinking game if viewers took a shot every time someone in the movie says something like, ""Here's how it's going to be"" or ""Here's how it's going to happen."
6539	6	a	This movie takes great pains to thank the fans who made this possible by including many characters from the series - a good deal for them, not necessarily so great for the rest of us.
6540	5	a	Its protagonists turn out to be not especially interesting and the audience is not presented any convincing reason to care about what happens in their lives.
6541	5	a	For a bikini action movie, it's not much. It's a rental that you'll probably fast forward through.
6542	1	a	It has moments of uncanny grace, made all the more beautiful by their dryness: a family, briefly, pulling together; a son suddenly understanding his father's dream; a tiny moment, at the end, of unexpected triumph.
6543	5	a	A nostalgic, but slight and messy sequel.
6544	6	a	With all due respect to giggles, though, you would do better to rent Raging Bull.
6545	9	a	The movie strives for the cracked, dizzy, New England charm of the old Newhart show ... [b]ut the generic Mooseport has no equivalent, just ye olde tedious jokes.
6546	6	a	...the shoddy execution of Dickie Roberts is about a dozen of whoopie cushions inferior to the insightful other sources that knew how to skew the outrageousness of this subject matter.
6547	3	a	Could have played as a docile father-son buddy picture, but it's much more.
6548	0	a	Don't be put off with all of the mentions of violence. Yes, bloodletting is at the core of the movie, and the ending is as downbeat as the opening scenes. But, gosh, you know you have been to see a great film.
6549	5	a	Penn's main idea about going native is making eye contact with a deer.
6550	3	a	Frothy, sentimental and thoroughly good-natured, Malcolm D. Lee's tale of coming-of-age at the roller disco doesn't have an original bone in its body, but it's as energetic, eager to please and endearing.
6551	6	a	A pretty dry and unengaging social treatise compared with Sayles' last movie, the underrated Sunshine State.
6552	3	a	Chicago makes up in atmosphere and color what it lacks in historical accuracy.
6553	6	a	Its general competence remains a surprising improvement, albeit not one strong enough to elevate it into the realm of recommendation.
6554	6	a	The film has some charm and a winning simplicity but not an iota of depth.
6555	5	a	More like paper movie. Delevingne has monotone voice and weird affect. Co-star Wolf has more chemistry with his screen buddies. This is no Fault in Our Stars. 
6556	1	a	The greatest success of Ixcanul, about a Maya woman living in the Guatemalan mountains, is that it makes you feel as though you have come to deeply understand a culture that is so deeply unfamiliar to us 
6557	0	a	Profoundly moving, profoundly shocking, profoundly important.
6558	4	a	It's a droll and invigorating alternative to the Disney and Dreamworks models. At the same time, you wish that Verbinski had a tighter grip on his storyline.
6559	9	a	You're kidding right? A truly embarrassing spectacle deracinated of the novel's interesting political questions.
6560	6	a	There is no real sexual tension between [Pfeiffer and Redford] from the get-go, so when they finally do get together, it feels forced, ungenuine.
6561	2	a	Johnny Depp does some pretty despicable things, yet you don't dislike him. There's just something about him that draws you in and wins you over.
6562	3	a	A modest but often side-splitting effort from the neurotic comic.
6563	3	a	If not exactly Orwell's Animal Farm, Barnyard has its levels of wit and significance.
6564	6	a	The film's focus on one man's story instead of the event itself is a solid narrative choice; the execution, however, is uneven and disappointing.
6565	4	a	A laid-back, colorful, and groovy glimpse of the magic of Woodstock viewed through the life of an up-tight young man who is a great caretaker unable to treat himself with the same care and support he gives others.
6566	0	a	an indictment of an entire social structure
6567	4	a	Good, but not great ... Romero has been surpassed by his imitators, who have learned to make zombie flicks with greater skill than the master himself.
6568	0	a	Hong [Sang-soo] moves slowly but deftly through scenes rich with social games and veiled confessions and allows his characters to emerge sadder but wiser.
6569	2	a	"Intelligent, fun and well executed, we could even say that the film works as a ""Ocean's Fourteen"". [Full review in Spanish]"
6570	9	a	Instead of seeing Dickie Roberts: Former Child Star, you could...pierce yourself with sharp objects.
6571	1	a	Rango a dynamic tribute to a lost genre.
6572	4	a	Although boasting some nifty set pieces despite its lacklustre and cheap-looking computer-generated animation - can't touch the brilliance and storytelling skills of the films that Disney/Pixar and Dreamworks are turning out these days.
6573	4	a	Some okay thrills with good performances and some smarts. But the last reel plunge spoils things.
6574	2	a	Entertaining but only mildly amusing.
6575	4	a	The tonal clash is jarring, and Mazer doesn't help matters by erring on the side of blandness.
6576	4	a	Not exactly the most ground-breaking story you'll ever see, but it's hard not to warm to a muso-friendly yarn with a character called Fleetwood Yak.
6577	6	a	Just once I'd like to see a time-travel movie inspired by true curiosity about the past, instead of by a desire to use it as a setting for action scenes.
6578	9	a	Urgh. Another slice of over-designed pseudo-gothic crud from the criminally over-rated Guillermo del Toro, who has dutifully followed up his Transformers knock-off Pacific Rim with a bloated, empty-headed haunted house jaunt.
6579	5	a	Any effort to compare scandals past and present fly by in this wastefully curtailed re-enactment of an impactful historical moment.
6580	3	a	Bryan Cranston brings to Mazur a sense of weary determination and a born performer's gift for deceit
6581	4	a	Once fans recover from the shock, they'll discover that this sitcom actress has the chops to tackle some pretty heavy stuff.
6582	0	a	...endlessly delightful, even as it deals in icky bugs and severed limbs.
6583	4	a	With its grindingly low-key tension and unusual perspectives, this Western has a chance to revamp the genre in intriguing ways.
6584	0	a	Successfully combines and transcends the sci-fi and detective genres to forge a serious drama, that stands head and shoulders above the cartoonlike approach of many of its popular genre brethren.
6585	2	a	If the movie never falls into a feedback loop, credit should probably go to Reilly and especially Silverman, who bring human vulnerability to little bits of ultra-branded ones and zeroes. 
6586	7	a	... Essentially consists of everyone involved hoping this is successful enough to make sequels.
6587	9	a	It all leads to nowhere involving or revelatory or particularly entertaining unless you are interested in Forster's hip, eccentric tastes.
6588	6	a	"If you ever yearned to see a version of 'Million Dollar Baby"" that has a completely feel-good last reel, this may be it. "
6589	6	a	"In the film's far-reaching goals, ""Hereafter"" fails to connect its meticulous plotting together, leaving the second hour unnecessarily tedious and overtly detached from the audience. "
6590	3	a	What happens in Vegas happens a lot in movies. Think Like a Man Too goes to the same casinos, strip clubs and pleasure pools with a fistful of jokers and an ace up its sleeve, the irrepressible Kevin Hart.
6591	4	a	Not enough films let their characters talk enough. Because if they did it would usually stop the idiotic plot in its tracks. Points for meandering down the road less traveled.
6592	5	a	For most adults, and kids raised on South Park, the painfully earnest story won't hold much interest.
6593	7	a	Isn't so much a man- versus- nature story as it is an idiots- versus- nature story.
6594	2	a	Personally, I had simply read/heard way too much hyperbole about this movie before my screening, so I couldn't help but feel a little let down afterwards.
6595	6	a	[An] oversimplified, overheated mediocre melodrama.
6596	4	a	As a religious satire, Sausage Party is about as subtle as crucifixion and it goes way too far, but the odd line is a zinger.
6597	0	a	To call the end result an absolute triumph would undercut more apropos labels; it seeks to be one of the best films of the year, and transcends that goal.
6598	2	a	If the substance of the story matched the look of it, this movie could have done justice to two of history's most fascinating and transformative characters.
6599	3	a	Yoav Shamir's documentary Defamation takes on such an explosive topic that the director only gradually reveals the film's real subject.
6600	4	a	[An] unusal comedy that parodies historical-epic cinema. [Full Review in Spanish] 
6601	6	a	Verbinski implements every hack-artist trick to give us the ooky-spookies.
6602	9	a	The film has no subtlety, so the one-dimensional story comes across as a sophomoric, pointless tirade.
6603	0	a	[A] hugely influential docu-drama.
6604	4	a	Mars'' needs Mom more than the filmmakers seem to realize.
6605	3	a	It's a rare treat when a film comes along that satirizes such a unique and passionate culture.
6606	4	a	Magical? Not so much.
6607	1	a	Just the facts, ma'am. That's all you need to make Chappaquiddick the year's most chilling movie.
6608	4	a	Cheesy but enjoyable.
6609	4	a	However long and honourable its pedigree, goes in one brain synapse and out the other...
6610	6	a	Crowe's first work in six years, following the disastrous Elizabethtown, is mildly engaging but ultimately too sweet-natured and innocuous for its own good.
6611	2	a	Geniunely thrilling.
6612	4	a	If you can get past the wafer-thin premise that serves as the foundation for Bolt, you'll find that it is a rather entertaining movie.
6613	1	a	"Knocked Up"" is one hilarious moment on top of another..."
6614	3	a	I find it to be one of his most sublime achievements, filled with a sunny laziness and slow awakening.
6615	3	a	It is a simple old-fashioned quest - the story holds few surprises - but done with immense charm and brio.
6616	0	a	This is a seminal film, building on older classics like Metropolis or Things to Come, but establishing a pervasive view of the future that has influenced science fiction films ever since.
6617	3	a	This year's Sleepless In Seattle. Only better.
6618	6	a	Doom is a standard science-fiction/horror film that threatens to be substandard before perking up considerably in its final half.
6619	1	a	An immediate guilty pleasure.
6620	5	a	The story has a strong 'been there, done that' feel to it.
6621	9	a	We'll forgive England for the Spice Girls. Maybe even Benny Hill, Joan Collins, Boy George, Fergie and that habit of pouring milk in tea. But with Bean's arrival, it might mean war. 
6622	6	a	"The problem with a story that relies almost exclusively on small talk is that they don't call it ""small"" talk for nothing."
6623	4	a	What does it say about a horror movie -- especially the fifth in a long considered DOA franchise -- that you simply want the storyline to stop and the inventive deaths to occur? 
6624	1	a	With a script as smart as the title character, Fresh keeps its viewers guessing.
6625	9	a	Unwarrantedly interested in B-list celebrity-gone-to-seed.
6626	5	a	The derivative shock-schlock wagon continues to roll on with the dull and unimaginative frightfest Devil's Due, a monotonous hybrid of Rosemary's Baby and Paranormal Activity slammed together in ugly unison.
6627	5	a	Truly bonkers, and perhaps something of a guilty pleasure.
6628	9	a	Arrives much like the same way a third TV commercial often follows a second.
6629	4	a	This cinematic plea for tolerance makes for more than tolerable viewing, thanks to Omar Sharif's title turn as the shop owner with a yen for aphorisms.
6630	4	a	The novelty is starting to wear off by this second sequel
6631	7	a	Who could have believed that Mike Figgis could churn out an utterly conventional, formulaic thriller?
6632	5	a	Quickly grows repetitive and tiresome, meandering toward messages that land softly, producing little impact.
6633	3	a	This movie is like a fancy sundae, a concoction of sweet thrills and empty calories. We shouldn't take too long admiring it, because it'll melt if we do. Just scoop it up, enjoy the sugary rush and smile.
6634	4	a	"Invictus may be a rather cheesy way into the story of South Africa, but in the end you're glad it's there for a new generation to whom the words ""Free Nelson Mandela"" are history."
6635	6	a	This lavish Spanish production begins to plod after a brisk, lively first half.
6636	3	a	Love, Simon - I really did.
6637	3	a	Seth Rogen is the Green Hornet. What else do you need to know?
6638	1	a	Forrest Gump told us life's like a box of chocolates; Benjamin Button reminds us of the melted, shriveled and petrified future of those candies: 'Nothing lasts.'
6639	4	a	"All in all, Bee Movie's large team of writers and directors scrape together enough for kids to enjoy, but kids these days have come to expect more than just ""enough"" from their animated movies."
6640	6	a	"This wanna-be ""classic, old-fashioned, grand Hollywood production in the Gothic romance genre"" becomes ridiculously graphic and violent."
6641	0	a	Think of it as the best episode of 'Cops' ever made. You can't take your eyes off this movie, and you'll leave with a very heavy heart when it's over.
6642	6	a	...[a] star-studded but tediously uneven low-brow sequel...Meet the Fockers is pretty much a flavorless family affair to forget
6643	3	a	A portal into the Western frontier revealing the prevalence of racism and sexism.
6644	3	a	Personally, I can't wait for the sequel.
6645	4	a	A sufficient collection of eccentrics, but it's not much of a story.
6646	9	a	"If you want a good thriller about a weirdo who creates trouble for a family ... rent ""Cape Fear."" Either version."
6647	4	a	"A well-played political message about economic equality responsibly caps off the fable, but Pooh's luxurious yet outdated philosophy about ""doing nothing to achieve something"" sticks out like a heffalump in the room."
6648	5	a	The unhappy truth [is] that this return visit to Middle Earth is a bloated letdown.
6649	6	a	Mostly just a second-rate Jane Austen story.
6650	6	a	The Hughes Brothers' ambition is admirable, but, as with their main character, ambition gets the better of them.
6651	0	a	"It's a journey that any fan of Peter Jackson's ""The Lord of the Rings"" Trilogy should enjoy."
6652	6	a	This is a movie for the ear and the eye, not the brain and the heart.
6653	3	a	Frankenheimer's compelling, if slightly fictionalized biopic of Robert Stroud is extremely wel acted by Burt Lancaster and the rest of the cast, including Thelma Ritter and Telly Savalas.
6654	4	a	A beatifully animated simple but fun plot, carries enough giggles for all age groups.
6655	1	a	So light and breezy you might not recognize this Paris postcard comes by way of the ever-relevant Woody Allen, who mixes time travel and nostalgia to delightful effect...
6656	3	a	Land of the Dead is living proof that films still can be inventive, that Hollywood is not the absolute center of the filmmaking universe and that a zombie film still can be scary and smart.
6657	1	a	A captivating spy thriller well worth the ticket price.
6658	6	a	Max Payne, game or movie, has precious little to say.
6659	5	a	[A] piece of pithy political pap. Sadly, [this] Man has all the biting promise of a crooked two-bit hack accepting a corporate kickback at a Chucky Cheese restaurant.
6660	4	a	Taken piecemeal, there's plenty to enjoy with 'The Light Between Oceans' but there's not much variation in tone. 
6661	3	a	Amy Adams does something akin to what Johnny Depp did in the first Pirates picture: take a potentially generic Disney movie and invest it with a sublimely inventive performance that takes the overall product to a whole other level.
6662	1	a	Hancock is a movie that tosses the genre cookie cutter under the bus.
6663	4	a	The new film doesn't have the same kind of focus, or locus, for its dark thrills and hilarity.
6664	4	a	Seinfeld comedy is cute fun for the whole family.
6665	6	a	Flightplan calls to mind that old Kris Kristofferson song, The Pilgrim, about the man who doesn't know if the goin' up was worth the comin' down.
6666	1	a	Imagine, if you will, that you are on an amazing vacation. One for the ages. Then, on the last day - you are mugged. No matter what transpired before, the trip is tainted.
6667	2	a	The sparkling and heartfelt performances from the four leads, plus the sheer boisterousness of the script, makes this a proper laugh-out-loud watch. 
6668	0	a	The Coens have left all their tricks and ironic jokery behind and the resulting film feels deeper and more personally felt than anything they have done before.
6669	1	a	Not just for genre audiences... deserves to be appreciated by anyone looking for smart, classy entertainment.
6670	6	a	[The writers are] so busy setting up the premise that they barely get around to exploiting it.
6671	6	a	Overall, it's just another movie, and it can be dismissed with the same short critique we so often apply to other movies: The book was better.
6672	4	a	Benjamin Button may be the most passive titular character in a motion picture until The Terri Schiavo Story gets off the ground.
6673	1	a	A pop culture sensation that drew notice to its own urgency and immediacy.
6674	4	a	While it seemingly draws on the likes Tarantino's Pulp Fiction and True Romance, there's still something alluring and awfully inviting about Jackie Earle Haley's lively and intriguing directorial debut, Criminal Activities. 
6675	7	a	It kicks off with egregiously bad CGI: A plastic-toy spaceship rends a fake-looking hole in the space-time continuum. The score is egregious. The acting is egregious. The egregious storyline is egregiously hard to explain.
6676	1	a	Not an easy picture to endure, as Weir carefully examines every last step and troubled breath...A film that develops after viewing, taking time to sink in as fates are reconsidered and brave motivations are appreciated.
6677	5	a	An origins movie that follows the serial killer's early years. As you might expect, those years didn't involve much time in a sandbox, unless of course Hannibal's spade was used as an instrument of death.
6678	5	a	Cronenberg is not a director to be daunted by a scenario in which the antihero spends most of his time in a stretch limo. Turning it into a film that interests anyone ... is another matter
6679	3	a	The pinnacle of recent B-monster movies. It's what Eight Legged Freaks wants to grow up to be.
6680	3	a	A sequel that reaches a higher plateau than its predecessor.
6681	6	a	Uncomfortable hodgepodge of poignant fantasy, showbiz satire and crime thriller.
6682	6	a	The movie is streamlined to a fault, a sleek and purring machine interested in process, not people. So when the plan begins falling apart, audience sympathy is fatally missing.
6683	0	a	The film pinpoints Selma's place in this overarching historical context without feeling browbeaten by it into merely erecting a memorial. It's full of quicksilver decision-making, sinew and guts.
6684	5	a	Somewhat erotic and warm, and pleasant to gaze at.
6685	1	a	James White is a deeply moving debut for Mond, a gorgeously made, beautifully acted stunner that is especially painful because it's so obvious that it comes from a deep personal place. But the movie's worth every moment you give it.
6686	3	a	Strong performances buoy teen-friendly historical drama.
6687	6	a	All in all, a disappointment from Mr Eastwood.
6688	5	a	Entertaining as it is at the start, Team America ends up falling back on the kind of foul language that feels more forced than exuberant.
6689	7	a	The fastest turnaround from must-see event to disappointing dud in history.
6690	4	a	A good Disney fantasy adventure for kids.
6691	1	a	Apocalypse wow.
6692	3	a	Tom Cruise, known to some for fun scenes as in the movie 'Cocktail,' is surprisingly effective in the role of the head of a conspiracy to assassinate Hitler.
6693	9	a	Should've left the first one alone
6694	2	a	The film gets us to see, in a new way, the strengths and weaknesses of weekly series television that viewers too often take for granted.
6695	3	a	Even though this installment is mostly a prelude, Jackson's eccentric mixture of low humor, earnest foreboding and digitally processed pageantry is consistently engaging and immersive.
6696	2	a	Whiskey Tango Foxtrot is basically a drama, being marketed as a comedy, that's a lot better than you probably think it is and finally gives Tina Fey a worthwhile lead role in a film.
6697	5	a	If the souped up, day-glo cars could have driven themselves, the movie could easily have done without the actors.
6698	8	a	The movie never makes up its mind what it wants to be, so it just chases the nearest emotion it can grab without ever earning it. 
6699	1	a	"Despite its drawbacks, ""American Hustle"" does have a rough-edged charm that holds your attention."
6700	2	a	A dismal trailer and misguided promotion make this look like a gothic horror story, when, in fact, it is a feel good love story.
6701	6	a	"to my surprise, once the action part of the story kicked in, ""Paul Blart: Mall Cop"" transformed into a rather enjoyable comic adventure."
6702	0	a	One of the year's best, an emotionally rich lesbian love story.
6703	3	a	Contains a lot of cool little ideas ... but is lacking the one big idea that opens up the possibilities of animated story telling.
6704	4	a	Paradoxically, Scott's crowded, misty, neon streetscape seems even murkier; fuzz I chalked up to VHS tapes is production designer Lawrence G. Paull dumping ashtrays in the air.
6705	9	a	Thanks to the wonder of digital technology, Marlon's head was spliced onto the body of a dwarf actor, thus accomplishing what certainly will go down in history as one of the more profound cinematic achievements of our time.
6706	9	a	A movie so flat and derivative that it seems to have been cobbled together from other, better pictures.
6707	6	a	It contains the most insufferably lame outtakes of any movie that I can ever remember.
6708	3	a	Although it's unlikely to make converts of the uninitiated, fans of the series and its characters will find the movie to be a worthy entry.
6709	2	a	"The Roman rulers used to distract the populace from the problems of corruption and decadence with ""bread and circuses."" Today's equivalent might be junk food and television, especially ""reality"" television."
6710	3	a	An engaging family drama, performed entirely in Yiddish and set within Brooklyn's ultra-orthodox Jewish community of Borough Park.
6711	3	a	A beautifully observed film that has become a guaranteed charmer for all ages.
6712	3	a	[a] well-executed, thoughtful look into the maternal connection and how it can destroy as much as it creates.
6713	5	a	A bitter confection chock-full of rusty barbs and a woeful, inexorable slide into doom and worse.
6714	3	a	It's a joy to see the master of zombie cinema return to take back the crown.
6715	1	a	Overall, I really liked this film, and I hope that people check it out in the admittedly crowded holiday season.
6716	3	a	A slick, funny and hugely entertaining film anchored by a genuine emotional centre.
6717	3	a	Thankfully, two powerhouse actors add a little extra somethin' to elevate that sticky sweet oatmeal we call a romantic comedy to a satisfying meal.
6718	3	a	A work blessed with keen insight into the heart and soul.
6719	3	a	A remarkable, thoughtful comedy with memorable characters and striking action sequences.
6720	3	a	Almodovar dives into this knotty, plotty mess the only way he can - with utter abandon and what might be best described as a kind of artful recklessness.
6721	6	a	Sausage Party glints of greatness, but this is half-cocked comedy at best.
6722	4	a	... a barrage of low-minded gags with high-spirited energy.
6723	1	a	On the surface, it's a sopa opera, a small-town melodrama about a troubled and powerful Texan clan, but it's Douglas Sirk's thematic critique, ironic approach and visual style that makes this Oscar-winning film stand out from the rest of the bunch
6724	1	a	A disturbingly plausible meditation on teen life in America as seen through the eyes of the talented Gia Coppola, Palo Alto is an absolutely stunning accomplishment.
6725	1	a	Fight Club's long setup is the funniest stuff Fincher has ever directed, and it hits its corporate, materialistic target with better accuracy than Mike Judge's Office Space.
6726	2	a	This movie is almost as much of a surprise as it is to wake up on Christmas morning to find just what you want under the tree.
6727	7	a	Bleak, brutal, and ultimately pointless, the film stars Guy Pearce as a man whose car is stolen and who won't rest until he not only gets it back but also punishes, with extreme prejudice, the dirtbags who took it.
6728	1	a	It is a wildly entertaining piece of work that features one of the best ensembles of the year. 
6729	4	a	A word of caution to anyone heading off to see The Break-Up with the assumption that it is a romantic comedy: this is not a comedy movie with a serious side -- it is a serious movie with a comedic side.
6730	2	a	"[VIDEO ESSAY] If ever there was a filmic guide to pagan Roman debauchery - real or imagined - ""Caligula"" is it."
6731	3	a	The spaniel-eyed Jean Reno infuses Hubert with a mixture of deadpan cool, wry humor and just the measure of tenderness required to give this comic slugfest some heart.
6732	4	a	Sure, I cried at the end. I'm not a robot. But I cry at cat food commercials if they punch the right button. I just can't get on the Button train. I wish I could have obeyed my instincts and stayed home.
6733	0	a	No dramatic feature has ever come quite this close to the matter-of-fact ugliness of the Nazi crimes.
6734	6	a	It's the strangest collision of lessons I've ever seen in a kid's film: Believe in magic but respect the work ethic.
6735	5	a	Nauseating amount of glucose sentiment.
6736	4	a	A Perfect Getaway is a little better -- well, a little stranger -- than most of the disposables this summer.
6737	5	a	Action flick has high body count, big guns, little point.
6738	4	a	A high concept script pokes fun at our online obsessions and Reilly and Silverman resume their voice roles with aplomb. 
6739	5	a	As is often the case with movies like this, it looks like the stars are having a whole lot more fun than the audience.
6740	6	a	The high-art appurtenances of the period romance overwhelm the story's potboiler elements, leaving us with a Janus-faced product that peers in both directions but remains uninvolved.
6741	6	a	Not clever enough for Smith fans, not gross enough to compete on the Farrelly brothers' ground, the movie feels like a kind of self-congratulatory fake.
6742	10	a	Yes, I have given this movie a rating of zero. But fans of the show should not consider this a diss. Consider it 'perfection.'
6743	6	a	It's not great movie-making but it's slick, confident and effective.
6744	1	a	Dominik paints a richly detailed mosaic on locations in Calgary and Winnipeg, and you can only marvel at the visual miracles achieved by cinematographer Roger Deakins.
6745	5	a	Just how old is this picture? Let's just say that when filming began, David O. Selznick was still combing the country for the perfect Scarlett O'Hara.
6746	6	a	It feels like a film that got stuck at the pitch stage, and never quite got turned into a real screenplay.
6747	2	a	My advice? Relinquish yourself to this hazy tapestry, and let the film take over. Squares need not apply.
6748	5	a	...we get a couple of moments of genuine suspense combined with a whole lot of cheap thrills.
6749	7	a	This chaotic mess of a film ... has the disjointed quality of a stoned-out fantasy.
6750	9	a	Director Nicholas Stoller and four co-writers throw logic to the winds, and they'll do anything for a laugh -- anything, that is, except actually be funny. 
6751	4	a	It's about the landscapes and backdrops. They provide a great diversion away from the poor dialogue and the bluntly heroic characters.
6752	5	a	The tagline is true - and so are the rumors.
6753	6	a	Fey and the cast try to anchor Whiskey Tango Foxtrot, which was shot in New Mexico, a not-entirely convincing double for Afghanistan. Despite everyone's best efforts, the end result is a war in which everyone - and especially the audience - loses.
6754	4	a	Mostly, Generations spends its running length searching for, and never completely finding, its niche.
6755	5	a	Boasts a bellyful of unintentional laughs.
6756	6	a	It's all head, no heart, which is generally the opposite of those formative years.
6757	4	a	Agora could have been a powerfully subversive feminist film, but while it does have its moments it never truly lives up to its ambitious potential.
6758	1	a	A mature and elegiac fantasy done with feeling and sincerity that really captures the mystique of old-time baseball.
6759	6	a	The film never provides compelling reasons to care about the fate of this poor little rich girl.
6760	5	a	Serious flick that feels more like a satire of a Robert Redford film.
6761	7	a	... it's a bit of a shock to see this caliber of star power and big-budget production and location juice... yield such dismal results. 
6762	5	a	A couple of Segway jokes stretched to an hour and a half running time.
6763	4	a	The story sometimes stretches credulity, but the talented cast brings out the drama. 
6764	1	a	It gives a clear-eyed view of the human costs of war: the physical sacrifices of the military men and women fighting it, the emotional costs to the journalists who cover it and the psychic toll on the civilians in the middle.
6765	7	a	Preaching to the converted, fans of the book should be sated. Julia Roberts is easy to love.
6766	4	a	The fact that the screenplay refrains from smug political commentary and instead focuses on action and mystery enhances the experience.
6767	5	a	It is in no way a match made in heaven.
6768	5	a	all the spark and imagination of a mediocre Lifetime Television for Women movie
6769	5	a	There's no questioning the sincerity or the worthy pro-tolerance sentiments of Love, Simon...but, whoa, does this film brim with bad direction.
6770	4	a	It's attractive and easy to slip into, but [Allen] didn't put enough thought into the design, and it soon falls apart.
6771	1	a	a moving testament to forgiveness and redemption.
6772	8	a	"Could you really have expected better from the people who made ""White Chicks""?"
6773	8	a	If the first movie was an irritating, poorly managed tale of people in love, Think Like a Man Too is straight-up obnoxious. 
6774	3	a	It doesn't reach the level of despair of some of Fassbinder's other works, but the artistry is unquestionable.
6775	6	a	Forget the rocky character development. Give me a fat guy falling down, and I'll start to laugh.
6776	6	a	Doom may be by the numbers,...but those numbers add up to the most cleverly engineered video-game movie made to date.
6777	4	a	Slow sci-fi drama for die hard Lucas fans only.
6778	0	a	David Cronenberg's North by Northwest
6779	4	a	"As teen movies go, ""Orange County"" is a refreshing change"
6780	10	a	When it tries to be funny it's usually appalling, but when it attempts to be sweet it's truly nauseating.
6781	4	a	Although Hanks' hand is quite noticeable in the powerful cast, as in the pleasing plot, the story is too simple to make this film transcend beyond providing a few hours of wholesome fun... [Full review in Spanish]
6782	2	a	Johnny Depp's beauty and talent salvage this rigorously stagy film on the life and bad-boy times of the second Earl of Rochester.
6783	6	a	The action scenes are generally pulse-pounding and gritty; the problem is that they don't build to anything.
6784	5	a	It's the kind of pic where the honest undersea treasure hunters are forced to work for a drug dealer.
6785	5	a	A hard pill to swallow despite the gallant efforts of Dennis Quaid and Louis Gosset Jr.
6786	4	a	The resolution Jindabyne eventually offers feels small and safe. The movie goes out with a whimper.
6787	3	a	An entertaining, oddly affectionate look at the cross-dressing grade-Z moviemaker.
6788	5	a	'Battle Royale' is another deeply flawed addition to the deeply offensive phenomenon of 'reality TV'.
6789	2	a	Wildly overpraised, but a solid return to form for the Coen Bros.
6790	4	a	"How Do You Know,"" his latest, is a near miss. A film that is completely in love with the sound of its human voices, this is a rather slim romantic comedy featuring a love triangle involving hugely appealing Reese Witherspoon in an odd role."
6791	4	a	Provides a decent, if not totally fulfilling, fix of that something we miss.
6792	4	a	t's a thoughtful, bracing drama in the mould of Lawrence's much-decorated Lantana.
6793	5	a	THIS sumptuous tale about partying princesses is big on glamour but short on story.
6794	6	a	A movie so literal that the character who wears an eye patch is named Patch, and where everything that happens is spelled out with the subtlety of a first-grade teacher introducing the alphabet.
6795	5	a	Flightplan grows more and more ponderous and frustrating as the reasons behind Kyle's predicament are revealed to be increasingly outlandish.
6796	1	a	A Private War tells Marie Colvin's story, which is just as vital as any conflict that she'd covered, and it does so with respect for its subject and the audience. It should not be missed.
6797	3	a	Amistad is the telling of an interesting event in American history, but doesn't draw its audience in to the heart of the story.
6798	3	a	Omar Sharif certainly doesn't disappoint in Monsieur Ibrahim.
6799	5	a	Zhang's flamboyant camera choreography and diva-ish flounces of melodrama are vivid but misplaced.
6800	3	a	Old and new, Skyfall follows the well-worn patterns of its predecessors
6801	1	a	If you see only one black and white film disguised as a road movie this year or next, make it Nebraska.
6802	0	a	A beautiful, haunting masterpiece from Peter Jackson, and proof that The Lord of the Rings isn't the only rabbit in his hat.
6803	5	a	An ambling, pleasantly inoffensive ensemble dramedy which suffers from a dearth of insight or elevating banter, and which mistakes authenticity for deeper dramatic engagement.
6804	4	a	Barbra Streisand has the show-stopping moments in this uneven comedy.
6805	4	a	Steinfeld smartly weighs the comedy of Nadine's hormonal disquiet against her potentially tragic need for affirmation, never more adroitly than in a shaded set piece involving an accidental sext.
6806	4	a	Evelyn jerks some earnestly sentimental tears, but for a true story it sure feels fake.
6807	0	a	A very worthy close-out for his remarkable output of the last decade.
6808	9	a	Kind of funny, especially for Celtic fans.
6809	6	a	Paper-thin...a meandering coming-of-age tale that comes across as a nostalgia trip for John Hughes devotees.
6810	5	a	A Lion King clone that's tailored to the Fisher-Price crowd.
6811	4	a	it's all very silly and highly unbelievable, but the five main leads are all having a good time.
6812	5	a	Initially, it seems like Hancock is going to have some fun with the superhero paradigm, but this dark, muddled and tedious noise machine winds up being an inferior copy of that genre's highlights.
6813	3	a	It is a fiercely watchable film.
6814	6	a	Alex goes to school, has a girlfriend, eats junk food ... and is almost as much of a zombie as anything George A. Romero has ever conjured up. Only less appealing.
6815	7	a	Never makes it to so bad it's good, stalling instead at so-bad it's bad.
6816	2	a	Part film noir, part melodrama, part Hitchcockian thriller, the film strives to be anything and everything and in many ways succeeds.
6817	9	a	"The old adage holds true - if you can't say something nice, ""Don't Say a Word."
6818	6	a	A freewheeling offshoot of the good indie Smoke
6819	4	a	The film retains much of the original humour, some of it well executed. It's reasonably faithful to the spirit of the books, probably because Kinney is the executive producer, but it's by no means equal to his originals.
6820	1	a	There are moments when Downey verbalizes a simple line of dialogue that becomes so profound through his magic of subtle emotion we're transformed.
6821	0	a	With a modern soundtrack and a diverse cast, Love, Simon is the kind of movie many people wish they had growing up.
6822	6	a	This comedy from Adam Sandler's Happy Madison production company takes itself too seriously for its own good.
6823	6	a	Owen Wilson manages to make it sporadically pleasant, but not nearly enough to make up for the mediocrity of this overblown sitcom.
6824	3	a	A glimpse into the private lives and dirty secrets of people trying to claw their way to a better place.
6825	9	a	The fact this is out in the same week as the fluffy owl movie beggars belief. It doesn't even belong in the same ruddy century.
6826	3	a	One of the most genuinely sweet films to come along in quite some time.
6827	4	a	Valkyrie is no action extravaganza. Yet despite having a rich seam of moral ambiguity to mine, the characterisation is no deeper than in Singer's X-Men.
6828	0	a	You'll want to see Chicken Run more than once.
6829	6	a	"American Pastoral"" may tell the heartbreaking story of Swede Levov, but a firm grasp of who he is and what he means remains maddeningly elusive."
6830	0	a	Good fortune found is always promising before bad fortune comes looking for it.
6831	3	a	All together now ... if you loved the first four Furious films there's no reason on Earth why you won't dig Fast Five
6832	1	a	[An] utterly absorbing film.
6833	6	a	Having some laughs over suicide.
6834	9	a	Try as he might to mold this woeful story into something momentous, Zhang turns the picture into punishment, ruining such extraordinary displays of bravery and fortitude with pounding aggression.
6835	1	a	While this modest indie offers high-tension plotting, it's real substance is the contrast between Hartnett's charismatic, hard-charging business persona and his intimacy-challenged real-life relationships.
6836	2	a	... its beauty lies in its simplicity.
6837	1	a	Until the characters can take their needs seriously and laugh at themselves, at least a little, they're not going to be healthy. Playbook traces all their journeys from stubborn self-assertion to a fragile connectedness that might lead to lasting bonds.
6838	9	a	You know a sequel serves no other purpose than to make money when it has no respect for the rules and history it has set up for itself.
6839	4	a	It's puzzling that Smith has taken this long to try a romantic comedy.
6840	0	a	It's a delight to scrutinize every inch of Lachman's deep focus compositions and try and take in the abundance of exquisite detail.
6841	4	a	A journeyman effort that's satisfyingly light on melodrama.
6842	6	a	elegant, sparse, and scrupulously acted but dramatically stunted 
6843	7	a	The humor is supposed to come from the recognition that another movie or entertainment world incident from the pages of Us Weekly is having fun poked at it.
6844	6	a	We should be leaving the theater in awe of what was accomplished, but the movie feels too by-the-books and unfortunately does not leave a lasting impression.
6845	1	a	The Edge of Seventeen immediately makes the high honor roll of high school comedy-drama.
6846	1	a	A thoroughly enjoyable comedy about a horrible man.
6847	10	a	Gamers would be better off playing Doom or sitting in front of a blank screen than wasting time with this incredibly dull Aliens rip-off.
6848	4	a	While it is completely predictable Armored is also efficient and suspenseful.
6849	4	a	Mazer's comedy pedigree ensures this is regularly laugh-out-loud funny.
6850	3	a	Sean Connery is fantastic
6851	4	a	The smartly engineered story may be enough to satisfy cerebrally starved science-fiction fans, but sadly Red Planet fails to engage on almost every other level.
6852	4	a	"My seven-year-old daughter, who's been raging to see this movie since it was announced, has already called it ""life-changing."" How do you argue with that?"
6853	6	a	A sloppy and not-funny- enough sequel to Meet the Parents.
6854	6	a	Short on laugh-out-loud comedy beats - while also failing to find the 'heart' that made similar genre farces like Blazing Saddles timeless comedy classics.
6855	0	a	Funny, brutal and breathtakingly beautiful. Two exceptionally raw lead performances, supercharged by a bold script from Martin McDonagh, could make Three Billboards this year's Awards-upsetter.
6856	3	a	Modest but twisty B-thriller is elevated by nice character touches, witty writing and its tropical setting.
6857	0	a	The year's smartest, most impressive comedy.
6858	4	a	Charmingly broad performances and lots of fanciful FX, which makes up for the weird tone.
6859	5	a	A great excuse for staying single.
6860	4	a	The tone of The Soloist is wildly uneven. Though unsparing and unsentimental when framing the principals, Wright is hyperbolic when depicting the agitation of the mentally ill and the soothing rapture of music.
6861	2	a	Any film that has marketing copy reading 'cannibalistic mountain men grossly disfigured through generations of in-breeding' can't be all that bad, can it?
6862	0	a	The final beats of Guadagnino's adaptation galvanize two hours of simmering uncertainty into a gut-wrenchingly wistful portrait of two people trying to find themselves before it's too late.
6863	4	a	Little more than a creepy B-movie with art-house trimmings.
6864	4	a	"One of the most iconic scenes in ""Scarface"" is set in a nightclub in Miami. The opening scene in ""The Infiltrator"" is set in a bowling alley in Tampa. That sums up the gulf between the movies that ""Infiltrator"" seeks to emulate and what it is."
6865	3	a	It's fast, slick and well acted. Lots of energy and a soulful performance by Wright make this well worth the trip.
6866	3	a	"Paper Towns"" might be the only movie to ever pay tribute to Walt Whitman's poetry, Woody Guthrie's music and the empowering theme song from the ""Pokemon"" cartoon series."
6867	4	a	Feels like an Oscar-bait title that somehow got its DNA mixed up with a daytime soap opera.
6868	4	a	It's as much of a guilty pleasure as the loud, adrenaline-fueled original -- maybe more so because it yields even lower expectations.
6869	4	a	The movie frequently clicks as a sendup of over-the-top film-noir storytelling.
6870	6	a	Viewers have come to expect visceral combat between characters who feel tangible in their appearance and reactions, but there's none of that here.
6871	4	a	At first the script is tight and twisty, but its resolution is a mediocre anticlimax.
6872	5	a	Time to hang up the boxing gloves, ol' Rocky.
6873	5	a	Will disappear, just like its title character, with only a wince to remember it by. 
6874	3	a	An uncompromising but wonderful film that reinforces the saying 'Never judge a person until you've walked in their shoes.'
6875	0	a	One critic has been quoted as describing Bjork's acting style as a re-invention of the art form. Another bit of hype that turned out to be true.
6876	5	a	Although it's been hailed by many, I found Sean Penn's film to be the tale of a megalomaniac as told by a narcissist.
6877	5	a	... American Dreamz is kind of all over the place from the beginning.
6878	7	a	Not only shamelessly rips off the best of the genre, but also fails to even put it into a nice sheen or an entertaining package.
6879	3	a	My problem with the film is the image of McCandless as a hero, when in fact, he seems more victim than hero to me.
6880	5	a	The series has gotten to the point where there is now effectively Nothing to See Here.
6881	5	a	Dripping with drink/drugs/infidelity melodrama: it's almost impossible not to make a compelling movie out of this material, but somehow writer/director Darnell Martin manages.
6882	0	a	The amazing depth of story and richness of composition make Citizen Kane a must-see for anyone who considers themselves a lover of films.
6883	5	a	Uh, he's clearly a woman.
6884	9	a	Sputters out after a fast start.
6885	4	a	It's all meant to be a cutting- edge examination of changing times, non-traditional breeding/parenting, but to my eyes there wasn't enough here to distinguish Julie and Jason from their co-habitating friends.
6886	4	a	A run-of-the-mill costume drama that made me think more about running home and Wikipedia-ing the characters than investing in the story before me.
6887	3	a	Allen and Wilson dip their toes into the golden age
6888	9	a	There is some lovely ballet in Mao's Last Dancer. And it's great to see Joan Chen on-screen. And I'm out of nice things to say about the movie.
6889	9	a	Darkman and The Quick and the Dead-- the two Sam Raimi films Jonah Hex most wants to be.
6890	6	a	Cox's film is really an empty experience.
6891	1	a	Within that loose framework, a powerful tragedy centered around human nature unfolds, and it's terrifying.
6892	3	a	It works because it's smart, knows it's smart, announces to us that it's smart - then backs off and lets the suspense and dark comedy mix.
6893	6	a	Wraps itself in the guise of a dark and quirky comedy, but it isn't as quirky as it thinks it is and its comedy is generally mean-spirited.
6894	9	a	Please, for the love of God, don't let it be a franchise. Think of the parents.
6895	6	a	If I wanted the story read to me, I would have bought the book on tape.
6896	4	a	Any sequel for a successful movie is a challenge, but comedies seem to have the most difficulty pulling them off. The comedy sequel is rare compared to horror and action movies.
6897	0	a	Incredible and action-packed fun for the entire family.
6898	3	a	This is a movie so singular, so intense, so overwhelming that it simply has to be experienced.
6899	9	a	The film is a toxic stew of stupidity that is so foul and rank that even the most forgiving fans of such corn-pone humor are liable to slink out of the theater.
6900	4	a	The film sometimes jars tonally but it's a worthy Halloween watch for all the family.
6901	4	a	A more than passable night out if you're fed up with the usual rom-com conventions.
6902	4	a	A cute, throwaway romantic comedy.
6903	6	a	To put music and race aside, and then try to tell the story of James Brown, is to climb into the ring with both hands tied behind your back.
6904	6	a	This film could well be a series of bad photos with artistic pretensions. [Full review in Spanish]
6905	4	a	Acting and writing are a little uneven, and the three strands sometimes feel contrived, but there's a strong central theme about the mess that people make of their lives and the mess that life can make of people.
6906	4	a	[Seth MacFarlane] approaches the Western not as a cinephile, but as someone who sat down and really thought about jokes to make about living in a not yet completely settled locale where danger comes from all sides.
6907	1	a	It's good, genuinely good, not just as a cultural sensation but as a movie all its own.
6908	3	a	It's Plaza who makes it all work as the center of the circus. She proves that she is much more than just a sitcom snark queen.
6909	8	a	Where did all the money go? That's all I could think about while watching Miami Vice, the summer stinker for this week.
6910	1	a	Demi Moore has never looked lovelier than she does in The Butcher's Wife.
6911	4	a	a weak, if fun, appendix to Romero's excellent trilogy.
6912	4	a	The depth of talent in the cast and gag writing shines through, but it's only just enough to take your mind off of the flat animation.
6913	2	a	Michael Mann is the first director to make Colin Farrell seem like a man rather than the impish thugs or mooning boy-men he usually gives us.
6914	3	a	"Skin"" doesn't cut as deep as Almodovar's best films, and the ending borders on generic melodrama. But as an elegantly nasty genre exercise, it raises goose bumps on your own skin. "
6915	1	a	The pairing of Nicolas Cage, one of the world's most out-there actors, with Werner Herzog, cinema's reigning madman-visionary, is a match made in looney-tunes heaven.
6916	7	a	Lacking any coherent vision, of all the recent movies derived from comic books, this is among the weakest.
6917	3	a	You know full well whether or not you're the audience for this film. Consider yourself either warned or enabled.
6918	4	a	Feverishly funny family fun
6919	3	a	Paranoid Park has the slightly glum insularity of minimalist fiction, but it's the first of Van Sant's blitzed-generation films in which a young man wakes up instead of shutting down.
6920	6	a	For all its sensitivity to the horrors of mental illness, The Soloist ends up as a fairly canned piece of work.
6921	1	a	It's a very simple movie that ends up making room for some invitingly complex ideas.
6922	1	a	If you like gory movies, this is the film for you.
6923	6	a	An agonisingly shallow, de-historical depiction of Turing as psychological agent.
6924	5	a	The intriguing subject matter is, to an increasingly dismaying degree, rendered moot by filmmaker Morten Tyldum's run-of-the-mill sensibilities...
6925	9	a	Gatins' script is a hopeless mess.
6926	5	a	Its oddness is chastening: what's ostensibly a triumph-of-the-spirit number doesn't make you feel very triumphant after all.
6927	2	a	This winning but nauseatingly upsetting documentary follows three people whose hands you would never, ever want to shake.
6928	6	a	The film tries to do too many different things at the same time, and the jumbling of goofy comedy and heavy drama doesn't work very well.
6929	3	a	The Bourne Identity is about as effective a thriller as you could want, especially if you don't want to think too hard.
6930	1	a	Return to innocence and Pooh with 'Christopher Robin.'
6931	4	a	The film seems determined to show us the uplifting side of the post-apartheid era, and that just feels like a whitewash, pun intended.
6932	5	a	Man of the Year is a total mess.
6933	5	a	Goes from The Thin Blue Line into Cape Fear and then settling into The Ring minus the supernatural element and social commentary. They just brought the well. I only wish I had received a phone call seven days before to warn me.
6934	5	a	Most of Michael Mann's movies have been broad-chested exercises in machismo ... but few have dealt in the sort of self-parodic chest-beating that undoes Miami Vice.
6935	3	a	If safety isn't guaranteed by the film's title, a viewer's satisfaction with this genial, warm-hearted movie pretty much can be.
6936	1	a	The Great Beauty soars into that rarified atmosphere where art, entertainment, travelogue and circus collide in a great, beautiful mash-up of ideas and imagery.
6937	4	a	Crowe is perfect for the role, creating a character that will quickly gain your sympathies.
6938	3	a	Another cool and subtle treatise on the nature of heroism from this American master.
6939	6	a	Its high points notwithstanding, Casa de Los Babys generally fails to make a lasting impression.
6940	4	a	Barker and Griffin obviously had an intriguingly twisty course clearly mapped out for themselves. Alas, much like those mice and men...
6941	3	a	The crashes, action sequences and effects are all accomplished pretty much seamlessly and professionally though one criticism of this movie is overabundance.
6942	5	a	Smith's invincibilty at the box office may come down, for this film is a mess. Not even his charm and personality can save this train wreck.
6943	0	a	Look for Frances McDormand to land another Oscar nomination for a superb performance where she convincingly conveys the profound distress of a grief-stricken mother desperate for answers.
6944	3	a	Fanboys is not groundbreaking, but it doesn't need to be, what it needs to be is a loving tribute to a hopeful time.
6945	5	a	The film ends up coming across like a version of America's Got Talent without the dancing dogs, juggling infants and bird impressionists that make the show worth watching.
6946	3	a	A biopic with a strong sense of character and period.
6947	8	a	The film is so bad it's hard to imagine anything saving it.
6948	3	a	American Hustle confidently tackles this concept of transcending reality through deception, showcasing the versatility of its exceptional cast amidst a tale peppered with savage laughs and dark twists.
6949	6	a	Suggests a filmmaker whose vision has become reductive, motivated not by all-embracing interest but by an ultimately self-protective intent not to surrender to blind emotion in any form.
6950	2	a	Bullock and Grant, who made for memorable interviewees on the red carpet at last year's Oscars, are ying and yang personified. This is a couple who could form a franchise.
6951	4	a	A fleet, nasty western that feels uncompromising in its violence.
6952	3	a	A film that isn't on the same level as other titles that pursue a similar purpose, but it's a decent attempt. [Full review in Spanish]
6953	6	a	Through it all, Felt himself is so steadfastly opaque that the audience feels more distant from him at the end of the film than at the beginning.
6954	0	a	Not only would this make John Hughes stand up and cheer, its honesty and tenderness are destined to leave a lasting legacy.
6955	4	a	Static, slow and slight, but with its own rewards. 
6956	2	a	Intense, though at times too frenetic, with an energetic performance by Val Kilmer.
6957	4	a	Doesn't soar to new heights but doesn't crash and burn either.
6958	3	a	Skyfall succeeds in providing epic escapism with just the right balance of action, art-house aesthetics and melodrama. 
6959	1	a	Its script is smart, its conceit a heart-tugger in the finest of senses, and it's the first Disney effort in way too long to be more concerned with being a movie than with being a breeding ground for product tie-ins.
6960	8	a	The leading contender for worst film of the year.
6961	6	a	An extraordinary achievement in character expressiveness and realistic movement limited by a storyline for a pre-middle school audience.
6962	4	a	Difret [feels] more like an on-site documentary than a dramatic film.
6963	4	a	Every so often you simply want a movie set in movie-land, featuring attractive people saying things that, if not witty, at least don't need a laugh track to prop them up, and you want it to play fair within the context of its tiny universe.
6964	4	a	Too often, the film gets distracted with things to giggle at, and breaks the spell.
6965	3	a	There's ambition here, as well as a shaggy brilliance and a rare willingness on the part of a director to work out his questions in front of us, on film.
6966	0	a	One of the all time great visionary SF films.
6967	4	a	For all its frivolity, fans should be more than satisfied with this final run around the track. 
6968	6	a	In spite of Cheadle's forceful performance, the watered down script fails to capture the rawness and polemic logic of a groundbreaking social commentator who spoke truth power on a daily basis.
6969	3	a	There is food for thought and food for every kind of feeling in Sean Penn's outstanding film.
6970	4	a	Pierre Boulanger, who plays Moses, has an intelligent, awkward boyish charm, but most of the interest comes from Omar Sharif.
6971	1	a	This is the Coen Brothers' leanest and least affected film since Blood Simple.
6972	8	a	Best used by Planned Parenthood as a pro-contraceptive, pro-choice advertisement--the idea of hauling kids to this junk is enough to make any prospective parent think twice.
6973	4	a	Whatever their goal is, Jurassic Park III is a little jagged and a little harsh. But it's also rather entertaining, even if you do expect to see the raptors wearing hockey masks and wielding chainsaws.
6974	4	a	Gauge your interest by how you liked Parents and you won't be disappointed.
6975	2	a	Charlize Theron goes from very pretty to pretty scary in the jarring feature debut from director Patty Jenkins.
6976	3	a	If the mere notion of Disney returning to their roots doesn't at least bring a tiny bit of a smile to your face, then you are, I'm sorry, completely dead inside.
6977	5	a	In its rush to push hot buttons, Disclosure neglected some essentials of good storytelling.
6978	5	a	There's not one moment in Secondhand Lions that feels genuine or heartfelt.
6979	3	a	One of the best spy thrillers in recent years.
6980	4	a	Will Smith charms again; best for teens and up.
6981	4	a	James Bond has been relegated to cinematic stupidity before, but demoting the character to this degree of slightness is even more deflating.
6982	3	a	though it's easy to dismiss McCandless' hippified musings and near-suicidal choices as the misguided actions of a kid who read Walden a little too closely in college, Penn's film aims for something more, a deeper telling of a tale of yearning and escape.
6983	2	a	Charlize Theron's breathtaking, heartbreaking transformation makes this movie about the woman called America's first female serial killer an astonishing achievement.
6984	3	a	It's a joy to see rom-com star McConaughey slip into the role of an amoral sociopath with such ease.
6985	1	a	[A] brilliantly animated, cleverly written family adventure.
6986	7	a	The Angriest Man in Brooklyn is like a brilliant clown stumbling off stage accompanied by a kazoo.
6987	3	a	There's a dark, dark humour throughout that keeps the film from plunging into over-the-top farce. In the end, BLT is a rambunctious, ridiculous feat of cinematic excess.
6988	4	a	always a classic, if slow
6989	3	a	...a guiltless film for nice evening out.
6990	4	a	Solid in all creative departments, and downplaying melodrama and big moments for an even-handed realism, it's an accomplished piece of filmmaking.
6991	4	a	Made me long for the days when director Zhang Yimou made intimate movies with emotional depth.
6992	0	a	Crosby and Fitzgerald work pure magic together.
6993	3	a	Laurel Canyon gets off to a shaky start, but its characters soon come to life
6994	6	a	doesn't seem to have anything poignant to say, opting instead to recycle broad generalities that have already been run into the ground on late night talk shows.
6995	6	a	Miller does good work when the script gives her anything to work with.
6996	4	a	If the writers had dared to step a little outside the borders of the western formula or if they'd even just shaken up the old formula a bit, this really could have been something special, but sadly, it just ends up being pretty standard.
6997	5	a	As a Hollywood satire, America's Sweethearts is toothless. As a romance, it is at best a minor pleasure.
6998	5	a	There's not a whole lot of story here to prop up the constant emotional yanking.
6999	1	a	Equal parts funny, touching, and great-looking, Ralph Breaks the Internet is the rare animated sequel that's better than the original.
7000	2	a	An amusing, touching, reassuringly wholesome romantic travelogue of a film that flies by on its way to the inevitable happy ending.
7001	2	a	The backdrop of a small island community during the all-too-brief summer is well captured, but in the end the film lacks the originality of, say, Kieslowski's Three Colors Blue, which had a similar theme.
7002	3	a	"A Most Wanted Man"" is not a guns-and-motorcycles spy story but a shadowy walk down a dark alley."
7003	5	a	Too much of the opening hour is spent establishing Tom and Isabel's happiness with unnecessarily extended scenes of the two frolicking about in nature.
7004	1	a	like a ballet where physical movements are used to show pain, heartache, evil and suffering
7005	4	a	As much as you might want to like it, the lack of gumption makes it difficult to go all the way.
7006	3	a	It Comes at Night combines the post-apocalyptic interpersonal conflict of the late George Romero with haunting imagery and an unrelenting sense of fear.
7007	3	a	An Unexpected Journey has so many pay-offs that most are likely to re-engage with the saga. 
7008	0	a	The most sentimental movie you needn't be ashamed to love.
7009	3	a	...a deceptively simple study in unrequited attraction that succeeds in spite of minor problems with neglected sub-plots.
7010	1	a	It's a mark of how magically written, directed and acted As Good as It Gets is that we end up loving this film despite knowing how haphazard, scattershot and almost indefinable its charm is.
7011	6	a	It actually plays everything so safe and predictable that it feels as recycled as some of the hand towels you find in restrooms.
7012	2	a	"There is no doubt about it - Amy Adams is the sole reason Walt Disney Pictures' ""Enchanted"" is so, well, enchanting."
7013	5	a	What was meant to be a wild ride through the seedy underbelly of the early Internet instead becomes a tepid wallow amid a slew of unsavory but resolutely uninteresting characters.
7014	5	a	If you've seen Independence Day, then you've seen War of the Worlds.
7015	2	a	The Predator pulls no punches and lays it all bare when the bullets and limbs go flying in quick succession.
7016	3	a	Stallone finds a good niche in this ensemble cop drama.
7017	1	a	Paul Schrader offers one of the year's best movies-a faith-in-crisis powerhouse about a pastor -Ethan Hawke hitting a new career peak-who is politically awakened by an eco-activist and a new kind of love. 
7018	0	a	As one of Pixar's star players, Stanton is an experienced cinematic storyteller, which is why it's disappointing that his first live-action project is so unwieldy at times.
7019	2	a	Fey finds a perfect middle ground between sarcasm and vulnerability.
7020	3	a	At this rate, writer-director Sofia Coppola is poised to become a classic storyteller who is more subtle, if not as grand-scale, as her father.
7021	5	a	Rock the Kasbah is riddled with plot holes, drags in the middle, and fails to understand how to properly develop its own characters. Bill Murray is as fantastic as ever, but even his amusing escapades can't save this sloppy embarrassment. 
7022	2	a	It is unremarkable, undifferentiated kid-family fun that's actually fun - which may be the most remarkable thing about it.
7023	3	a	A bare-knuckled, absurdly comic and at times unbearably tense look back at the madness of the Bosnian conflict.
7024	4	a	Becoming Jane takes a stab at being a historical romance in the vein of Shakespeare in Love, but something key is missing.
7025	2	a	Super-cute, even though there's not much there.
7026	3	a	It's a generous, humble work: a soft hymn to a lost world.
7027	0	a	"Love, Simon"" exists on a spectrum between ""Lady Bird"" and ""Mean Girls."" It has the warm winsomeness of ""Lady Bird"" and the crackling humor of ""Mean Girls,"" playing with the high school archetypes that film captured so well."
7028	4	a	The film works as a lurid death drop, but it invites us to cherish Aileen, to feel her pain no matter how low she goes.
7029	3	a	A joyous crowd-pleasing movie that pays homage to the great silent film era in a clever way that offers multiple layers.
7030	6	a	The whole devolves into an over-long Family Guy episode chock full of random asides, weird cameos, and goofy homage.
7031	7	a	The numerous battles are confusingly handled and the actors aren't given many opportunities given the dialogue they're forced to speak. 
7032	6	a	The problem with Vantage Point is that the rapid-rewind technique keeps interfering with the thriller's momentum.
7033	4	a	There is a sub-category of comedy ... in which we laugh at the hideously humiliating experiences of some poor sap. If this is your kind of humor, than this is your kind of movie.
7034	2	a	Visually stunning, it's an epic saga of survival and redemption.
7035	4	a	Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri, which flickers with a raw, elemental power despite occasional conveniences, heavy-handedness, and a too-savage tone.
7036	3	a	Easily one of the funniest family films to come out of the Mouse House in years.
7037	3	a	A teen drama for this generation.
7038	3	a	Button has a wide-eyed innocence that almost never palls. It strays far from the mind of F. Scott Fitzgerald, but often enough it came near to my heart.
7039	3	a	it really is a nice and cheerful film that comes as a welcome respite to most of the other multiplex behemoths and a good portion of the reason why it works is because of its innate sincerity and pleasantness. 
7040	6	a	Thusly, I don't care about her, could care less if Sayuri finally finds true love. That means I don't like the movie, and if I ever write my own memoirs about my life reviewing film I'll make sure and say it again.
7041	3	a	One of the rare recent fright flicks to get the heart thumping.
7042	4	a	Disturbing images in intense, mature character study. 
7043	4	a	It's a serviceable adventure film that does the job in less time than the original film.
7044	3	a	It's a funny movie, but not an uproarious one. It's not overstated or understated, but clearly and honestly stated, and anchored by strong performances from its young cast.
7045	2	a	Would've made for an extremely marvelous picture were it not for the fact that it falls victim to a worn storyline.
7046	5	a	Dull and drab, with a lack of imagination
7047	9	a	This is the True Gibson Story version of the death of Christ, in all is re-created gory.
7048	0	a	A much-loved revisionist Western, director Peckinpah's second feature film proved to be a bittersweet swan song for the Old West and a classy farewell to the screen for actors Scott and -- for some years -- McCrea.
7049	1	a	With a smart and refined script by Taylor Sheridan that is both tense and sarcastic, and a cast of fully fleshed out characters that demand investment, the contemporary Western is an exceedingly enjoyable surprise.
7050	8	a	"Bill Murray's making broad, sloppy comedies again. That sounds like great news for fans who grew up on ""Meatballs"" and ""Stripes."" It's not."
7051	4	a	Scott is terrific, his ironic detachment slowly sliding away into self-knowledge as his character gradually comes into focus.
7052	4	a	A mildly entertaining comedy about the adventures of two English princesses on the evening of V-E Day.
7053	3	a	There is much to appreciate in Fincher's film, which was clearly a delicate undertaking. Ultimately, it is ambitious enough that a misstep or two can be forgiven.
7054	0	a	A cross between a thrill ride and a particularly satisfying video game... it's the kind of movie you need to see over and over again.
7055	2	a	The film is still commanding and distinctive, regardless of its flaws, with the young director - who is still working his way up the industry ladder - showing great potential and a directing career worth keeping an eye on.
7056	1	a	Truffault's masterpiece. Timeless and true, heartbreakingly sad.
7057	2	a	Frances McDormand's performance is a highlight of the film. She plays the dour, hostile Mildred in a way that displays her rage and impatience frankly but without dulling the edge of humour in her perpetual antagonism.
7058	3	a	As its magical spell takes hold, so the film's true depths become apparent, each character dealing in their own way with the departure of a parent, and issues of love, loyalty and loss.
7059	1	a	What follows is one breathtaking action sequence after another, each one surpassing the next in thrills.
7060	10	a	Total garbage...visually vile, to be sure...but what's worse is that it's a crushing bore.
7061	3	a	Throughout, Hazanavicius finds clever, poetic ways to illustrate the allure of Golden Age Hollywood stardom...
7062	9	a	Heffalump may have hummable songs by Carly Simon. But it's about two and a half lumps shy of being any good.
7063	3	a	"Everyone quotes the Scottish-accented misanthropy. But at its heart, ""Axe"" is a sweet, funny romance between people trapped in patterns and freed by a positive paradigm shift. It's also the reason we never see Mike Myers' true face in films anymore."
7064	5	a	A more fitting title might have been Jane Got a Gun, But Didn't Get to Do a Whole Heck of a Lot With it in the End.
7065	1	a	This film was also not only the subject of my very first movie review, but also the reason why I started reading movie reviews in newspapers and paying attention what the critics actually think about movies.
7066	2	a	Film Stars Don't Die in Liverpool plays the will-she/won't-she tell him and spoil a lovely romance too long. Yet the revelation is staged wonderfully by McGuigan as part of a breaking point quarrel.
7067	5	a	A disposable B-movie without much excitement or ingenuity.
7068	1	a	Herzog has found his ideal interpreter, a performer whose truth lies deep in the artifice of performance: ladies and gentlemen, Nicolas Cage, at his finest.
7069	4	a	Most gags are cooked on the raw side.
7070	4	a	"Hello, My Name is Doris"" never quite strays into anything deeper than what it presents, and the film spends too long on the unrequited love between Doris and John, but it has a certain and distinct charm that's hard to escape. "
7071	3	a	A tense, heartfelt, funny and sometimes brutal film.
7072	5	a	Fincher's selling us beautifully cheekboned movie stars frolicking in bedsheets and calling it a great love. I didn't buy it for a second.
7073	4	a	Just how much of this will be appreciated by children is questionable, but the film is clearly intended to keep them happy with lashings of colour, movement and cheesy jokes while older, diehard geeks can enjoy all the reference spotting.
7074	5	a	Maybe Battle Royale's ultimate punchline is its inexplicable ability to fool some people into taking it seriously.
7075	2	a	Dvuall and Caine have such easy charm that they make this movie work, though it sags when anyone else is on screen.
7076	1	a	Faster, funnier and wilder, with more cunningly contrived computer effects.
7077	3	a	Sick and twisted in the most interesting ways.
7078	2	a	A radiant Vanessa Redgrave heads an almost perfect cast in this unabashedly romantic movie
7079	5	a	Failure to Launch isn't even a one-trick pony. It's a no-trick pony. 
7080	3	a	Sean Nelson is a quiet revelation as the title character, a child who actively participates in what he regards as the only game in town, yet consistently demonstrates more caution and smarts than his friends or relatives.
7081	6	a	Partly campy, mostly straight-ahead horrific and nearly always watchable.
7082	5	a	...aspires to an almost adult level of seriousness.
7083	1	a	Among a cast loaded with talent, McQueen and Robinson are excellent
7084	6	a	Hanks, as a writer-director, is talking about real things, even if he isn't depicting them with complete honesty.
7085	3	a	"Larry Crowne"" proves that it's possible to be funny without being crude. But more than that, it's as easygoing as the character for which it's named."
7086	5	a	Fans of Bongo playing narcissist Matthew McConaughey will breeze through this formulaic rom-com, though it possesses about as much charm as it does logic.
7087	6	a	...showy, shapeless, overwrought, senseless and arbitrary...Bartkowziak's baby went rock-a-bye all right and the frantic wind did excessively blow-but this Cradle simply didn't rock.
7088	5	a	On a strictly impressionistic first watch I intensely hated it. 
7089	3	a	The film offers one of the most indelible performances of the year: Sandy Martin, playing the frog-throated and chain-smoking Mama Dixon as a beer-swillin' coach potato Machiavelli.
7090	6	a	Valkyrie is a World War II thriller without enough thrills.
7091	3	a	There is a strength in the simplicity of this story, in the almost fairy-tale quality of its images and the shocking suddenness of its violence, that Hollywood in its sophistication has lost.
7092	5	a	A movie that never delivers on its premise; a movie that takes promising character dynamics and gullet-stuffs them with idiot dialogue; a movie that will alienate all but the wee and easily impressed with its frequent lurches into stupidity.
7093	5	a	In a pre-election season full of drama, contention and surprise, Man of the Year arrives on the scene with the blistering impact of a spoonful of cold mashed potatoes.
7094	0	a	Silver Linings Playbook is a rare thing indeed - a romantic comedy that completely delivers on both sides of the equation. 
7095	5	a	Beverly Hills Chihuahua may not be comic gold, but it at least tried to throw in some entertainment for the adults in the crowd.
7096	6	a	So overlong and random that it spoils a mesmerizing lead performance and an appreciation for how big a deal with this artist/designer was, at his peak. 
7097	7	a	I Origins tries desperately to imbue a deeper metaphysical meaning with its narrative, but the alignment of all its concepts come off as disjointed and pretentious.
7098	3	a	The prolific Kaurismaki's sweetest slice-of-lifer yet.
7099	6	a	The Holmes story has fared better in a pair of documentaries.
7100	2	a	Bright Star does manage to recharge the director's creative batteries, with material that allows Campion to exercise her amazing ability to depict love's ever scarring touch.
7101	1	a	"Midnight in Paris,"" a parable about romanticism and nostalgia, recalls Early Owen as much as Early Woody. "
7102	5	a	... you may get a half-hour sitcom's worth of laughs, but little more.
7103	4	a	Romantic comedies usually stand or fall on the likability of the leads, and the leads in Must Love Dogs, Lane and John Cusack, both of whom downplay the shtickiness of the material by underselling it, are very likable.
7104	3	a	Brady's world is also one of tragedy and hardship, biological fragility taking its toll not only on Brady but those he loves, changing times curtailing his options.
7105	3	a	Camelot, it's not. And, as this terrific movie suggests, the American people fall for their polished BS every time.
7106	5	a	Book a one-way flight on the original Phoenix instead.
7107	4	a	Hecker's got a knack for teen misery, but he's aiming higher than beers-and-boobs moronity. What follows is excruciating excavated high school trauma
7108	5	a	completely forgettable 
7109	3	a	Smith, with one tweak or twinkle too much, could become too smug, too princely, but is almost totally appealing.
7110	3	a	... addresses the current generation of maturing adults who are all but emotionally homeless. Despite the story zipping forward with its sillier intentions, the underlying angst effectively resonates.
7111	4	a	Lively and affectionate, Matt Tyrnauer's documentary is made for those who believe, as he does, that the work of fashion designer Valentino is worthy of the most respectful chronicle.
7112	5	a	What kind of twisted fantasy is this?
7113	4	a	A formula picture that never rises above the generic but entertains nevertheless.
7114	5	a	Sloppy political satire ... Williams has all the edge of Tom DeLay at a Greenpeace convention.
7115	8	a	Shallow, incompetent, hopelessly contrived.
7116	0	a	The film brings us into small-town living, and dying, and all the difficulties in between.
7117	4	a	Like Anne, it is as if the pair's ambition has gotten the better of them, and for all their strengths as filmmakers it's the hurriedly chaotic storytelling which ultimately slices this film's jugular to bloodily exasperated smithereens.
7118	0	a	It's a gamble. Air Force One goes against the current grain of presenting presidents in movies as evil or idiotic, or mock heroic, as in last year's 'Independence Day.'
7119	5	a	Best of all, the directors don't shy away from the ending their story demands.
7120	5	a	Though there's a clarity of purpose and even-handedness to the film's direction, the drama feels rigged and sluggish.
7121	0	a	One of the best American horror films in years.
7122	5	a	Blacula was a drama first and a horror and blaxploitation enterprise after that. Scream Blacula Scream is a blaxploitation horror film that takes its influence not just from its predecessor, but the burgeoning subgenre as the whole.
7123	5	a	Doesn't have a lick of cynicism -- it's as pure of heart as they come. A fine ideal, but it feels as flat as a pizza.
7124	10	a	So bad it can't even steal effectively from good movies that came before.
7125	4	a	The Bourne Identity is much like a Jackie Chan movie, only with Mr. Matt Damon performing the superman stunts.
7126	4	a	Violent post-nuclear sci-fi is Orwellian.
7127	3	a	Great movie for high schoolers and their parents.
7128	6	a	A bloated, dull mess of a film that meanders when it should move and stumbles when it should run.
7129	4	a	A sanitised version of events that focuses on fame rather than notoriety.
7130	3	a	The worst thing about boxing films is the boxing... Bleed for This, thankfully, knows these pitfalls.
7131	4	a	Dry and a bit slow, but there are a few rewards to be found.
7132	6	a	Alpha Dog, like most of its cast, is posing.
7133	5	a	Pokes fun at a program that doesn't take itself seriously, cutting down easy targets like an eighth-grade bully picking fights with first graders.
7134	3	a	For those who like their Cronenberg thick and chewy
7135	4	a	While the animation remains chock full of invention and the humour reliably athletic, this prehistoric caper somehow ends up being not quite the sum of its many witty and creative parts.
7136	4	a	The slightest twinge of emotional conflict sends the lead character outside to stare blankly into the sunlight... those empty stares are almost too apt for a film with an offscreen story that is so much more interesting than the actual movie.
7137	6	a	At no point did I feel like I was at Woodstock and surely that was the whole point.
7138	5	a	It's described as a black comedy, but you can forget the comedy part.
7139	1	a	...increasingly absorbing...
7140	3	a	Payne's latest considers the notion of legacy with quietly heart-wrenching attention to detail, and is one of his sweetest yet most unsentimental films to date.
7141	4	a	Its fine cast, particularly Mr. Macy, lift it above its limitations and lend grace to its once-again timely message.
7142	3	a	Moving at its own pace, this is a fantastic study of Mid West America, where time almost stands still. 
7143	2	a	The filmmakers do not feel the need to fill in every single blank for viewers by the time the credits roll. Just as in reality, these characters' problems are not going to be solved with the wave of a magic wand; there are no short cuts to happiness.
7144	3	a	There's not much more you can ask from a movie like this. It's a rare drinking comedy that doesn't require you to be drunk to enjoy it.
7145	3	a	Thought provoking and disturbing at times.
7146	4	a	It's Penn's heavy-lidded, dead-behind-the-eyes turn that overshadows all, carrying the weight, pain and misery of the world -- and the picture.
7147	3	a	We are treated to an interesting take on the vampire legend ...
7148	4	a	Vikander and Fassbender are riveting in a handsome period drama that begins beautifully, but becomes increasingly contrived as it tries to wring as much drama as possible from its set-up.
7149	3	a	Depp's Window turns a typical King yarn into a rewarding psychological portrait
7150	1	a	Revolutionary Road is content to be a powerful film about an ordinary troubled marriage; the kind taking place in a handful of houses on your block - perhaps even in your own.
7151	6	a	It's just not particularly funny. That Segway, alas, only goes so far.
7152	6	a	One wonders: Was the screenplay presented to Julia Roberts as a traditional bound manuscript, or as a catalog of bumper stickers?
7153	4	a	Jack Black and Cate Blanchett essay their respective roles as a cheerful warlock and a kind-hearted witch with aplomb.
7154	6	a	What all this adds up to is a film with the consistency of fairy floss, enjoyable provided you're not expecting substance of any kind at all.
7155	3	a	Clearly, Richard Kelly is a director to watch.
7156	6	a	There's ... enough cheery mockery to amuse even non-tokers.
7157	1	a	A character-driven piece about regret and true partnership - our basic, primal need for someone to take the journey with us even if safety is not guaranteed. 
7158	6	a	Choppily edited and obviously rushed into theaters to make a quick, tidy profit.
7159	3	a	Stiller has a gift for looking funny effortlessly, when he's doing nothing physical. With no mugging, no physical contortions, he turns his face into a palette of pain and confusion.
7160	2	a	Though it may damage my credibility as a respectable movie critic, I'll proudly list Resident Evil on my list of this year's guilty pleasures.
7161	9	a	Wilson, with his immaculately off-kilter comic timing, is still a pleasure to watch. But Rudd can't rescue his character from the insipidity to which Brooks's screenplay condemns him.
7162	3	a	Hailee Steinfeld's star continues to rise.
7163	4	a	The Imitation Game is at its best when it focuses on the collision between cryptography and proto-programming. The film's efforts to function as a character study, on the other hand, are decidedly clumsy.
7164	4	a	Jurassic Park is an astonishing success in one sense and one sense only: It is the monster of all monster movies, guaranteed to challenge weak bladders, flutter heartbeats and win automatic Oscars for the [tech crew].
7165	5	a	Ho hum story, generic fireworks.
7166	5	a	Displaying more corn than is usually found at the North Pole, Arctic Tale documents the travails of a polar bear cub and a walrus pup as they struggle toward adulthood.
7167	5	a	The dogs are never quite as entertaining as they should be for the kids in the audience, and the hypercutesiness and speechifying at the end will lead to much tightening of adult sphincters.
7168	6	a	Even if you resist recklessness, these car catharses surge with noise, energy and adrenaline.
7169	9	a	Halfway through this movie, you'll beg cupid to shoot you.
7170	3	a	It's Dominik's uncompromising, uncommercial vision and the two leads that give the story such a wonderfully wounded grandeur.
7171	6	a	[T]his continuation of the story from the television show is so dependent upon one's intimacy with the show that, as a standalone movie, it is restrictive.
7172	3	a	The sheer dynamism of the action, coupled with Hans Zimmer's lavish score and the forcefield of Crowe, still makes this a fiercesome competitor in the summer movie stakes.
7173	9	a	Shallow, meandering, predictable, padded, and jam-packed with one unfunny, hoarily conceived slapstick bit or pratfall after the next.
7174	4	a	"One of those ""chick flicks"" that actually tries to wedge some sincerity into the equation."
7175	4	a	What do you call a character study with shallow, sketchily-drawn characters, but a gorgeous setting? A scenery study, perhaps. Or an atmosphere study.
7176	6	a	The story has to move along at a fair clip because otherwise we'd notice how nonsensical it all is.
7177	3	a	First and foremost it's great fun, secondly it offers pretty strong feminist role models...
7178	3	a	You'll leave the theater wanting to call your grandparents just to say hello.
7179	1	a	Egoyan's first Cannes Film Fest entry is an engaging tale of sexual desire and alienation.
7180	6	a	Since there's no real-world grit to go with the grace, the story comes off as shallow and unaffecting.
7181	4	a	Brewer uses these plot machinations to investigate ideas of race, religion and redemption in a way that for most of the film's running time is unusually riveting.
7182	6	a	More likely to have you scratching your head than hiding under your seat.
7183	2	a	...weird and unorthadox and innovative and clever, but the main thing is that it's funny.
7184	6	a	How is Breakin' All the Rules different from all the countless other romantic comedies specializing in misunderstandings and mistaken identities? It isn't.
7185	6	a	"The Angry Birds Movie"" is about as filling as the game itself, and has little to say other than friendship is good, pigs are bad, and angry payback is best of all."
7186	0	a	Morten Tyldum's espionage thriller about Alan Turing is purely sensational with a performance for the ages by Benedict Cumberbatch. One of the year's very best.
7187	9	a	The cast got to spend a month shooting on Bora Bora. So that explains why they're in the movie. Why you'd spend good money for a ticket to watch them have all the fun and not have any fun yourself passes understanding.
7188	4	a	Cute, charming, spirited stuff
7189	3	a	Kasi Lemmons' contemporary adaptation is an uplifting holiday extravaganza with a musical score filled with familiar spiritual standards plus some new songs by Raphael Saadiq and Laura Karpman that underscore themes of faith, healing and family.
7190	4	a	... unobjectionable enough for undemanding kids ... 
7191	3	a	A mild romantic comedy rooted in class anxiety, but it's nice to see perennial loser-in-love Pullman get some. Respect, that is.
7192	9	a	Brody has offbeat charisma, but it's no match for the corny dialogue he's given here, not to mention the Wild at Heart snakeskin jacket he wears.
7193	0	a	The performances, from start to finish, shimmer with conviction.
7194	4	a	... it provides enough sexy rides, blacktop fury, screeching hairpin turns and crashes to keep the celluloid humming ...
7195	4	a	The deaths are just as gruesome and fun as ever, but the script's utter lack of originality drags things down quite a bit.
7196	2	a	Handsomely made, respectably acted, and reveals an interesting and important piece of world history. In other words, it's a standard biopic.
7197	5	a	For every minute of whimsical diversion such as the crew dancing through the streets of Japan dressed as panda bears, there is another equal dose of something so foul as to offset the laughter with a painful groan
7198	0	a	Better brace yourself for the best Bond episode in ages, thanks to Daniel Craig's coming of age to make the role his own.
7199	3	a	The film is good enough; Streep is the X-factor that makes it excellent.
7200	4	a	The Green Hornet attempts to mock its own genre, but it forgets to deliver a compelling characters along the way.
7201	4	a	A film where there is a constant struggle between the original text, the script and the way in which McGregor intervenes but manages to carry it out with sobriety. [Full review in Spanish]
7202	5	a	"Good Luck Chuck"" is a soft-core male indulgence posing as a hip Hollywood good luck chuckle."
7203	4	a	A perfectly marvelous matinee option for young children.
7204	3	a	How nice it is to see that representation is presented as so normal.
7205	6	a	Too much of Taking Woodstock seems barely sketched out.
7206	3	a	A sympathetic but honest look at a man whose formidable talent was equaled only by his penchant for making bad choices.
7207	7	a	America's Sweethearts is a balloon, all right -- a lead one.
7208	5	a	American Dreamz puts reality TV and U.S. politics in its crosshairs, then fails to pull the trigger. It's less entertaining than an average episode of American Idol. And that's saying something.
7209	0	a	It's not just a great horror movie. It's a poem of horror, a symphony of dread, a film so rapt, mysterious and weirdly lovely it haunts the mind long after it's over.
7210	4	a	A coming-of-age movie in the vein of--though superior to--a Tony Gatlif special
7211	2	a	You may think you know the whole story, but Curran's feature showcases a whole other side to the facts, whilst simultaneously crafting a timely cautionary tale for today.
7212	5	a	Ours is not to question why; ours is but to watch 'em die.
7213	1	a	Projects and directors are rarely better matched than The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo and David Fincher.
7214	6	a	This updated version, starring Colin Farrell as Crockett and Jamie Foxx as Tubbs, is far from a disaster, but doesn't rank with Mann's best work.
7215	4	a	A transparent feel-gooder.
7216	4	a	This is the real deal, and it shows up the likes of pre-Eighties Xanadu and Roller Boogie poseurs with a funky, grooving panache that's all its own.
7217	9	a	It swears it's being clever yet refuses to trust the audience.
7218	1	a	Compston's performance and the downer milieu, presented with appropriate paint-peeling profanity, are more than enough to keep an audience riveted and ultimately moved close to tears.
7219	4	a	Amiable light rom-com.
7220	8	a	Breathtakingly efficient, immaculately constructed... This is the ne plus ultra of blockbuster filmmaking.
7221	5	a	If Rashomon were filmed through a shampoo bottle, you'd have some idea what to expect from the surprisingly mean-spirited comedy, One Night at McCool's.
7222	3	a	a cheesy, B-movie thrill ride with a lot of action, over-the-top special effects and a super cool leading man.
7223	5	a	The phony mythos turns into equally spurious pathos that plays like bathos because not one iota of the sentiment or sympathy has been earned.
7224	9	a	Even the film stock's colour tint looks cheap and nasty. Don't say we didn't warn you.
7225	4	a	A simmering soap opera with a much stronger cast than it deserves. ... [Its] edges are so smooth that it feels like it has been processed by some photo editing software.
7226	0	a	THE Rosalind Russell movie, and still fabulously funny.
7227	4	a	Works up a good sweat, but never quite lands that killer punch. 
7228	7	a	"Criminal acts and scenes of brutal violence spoil the effect of ""Barnyard"" as an animated movie for tots."
7229	4	a	Disney surely sees that inside the kinetic movement of Pixar films is a lot of restraint. Bolt is super-fast, yet not as super-sincere as it would like to believe.
7230	6	a	An unstructured, atmospheric affair ostensibly designed to appeal to folks nostalgic for the hedonistic hippie era.
7231	3	a	A rather entertaining picture.
7232	1	a	Skyfall represents the new standard in one of cinema's longest running franchises. It is a deeply personal, exquisitely shot film that had me mesmerized from the opening scene.
7233	3	a	Follows a tried, tested and triumphant formula that so often illuminates the silver screen - except this one is based entirely on real events.
7234	3	a	A biting broadside attack on mindless consumerism.
7235	9	a	Following Chuck Barris around as he deals with folks clamoring to be on the show, it's less A Hard Day's Night and more a hard day's watch.
7236	1	a	McDonagh has created a comic tragedy that ducks and feints, defying expectations with many admirable and some less convincing results.
7237	8	a	As funny as it is frightening, The Atomic Cafe is a genius, tongue-in-cheek retrospective of a far less cynical time, and the lies that the government used at the time to justify their new power.
7238	6	a	The Star Chamber works brilliantly until it locks into a plot. Then it stops dancing and starts marching.
7239	4	a	Not one of Hong Kong action giant Jackie Chan's greatest movies, but it's entertaining and provides loads of martial arts fights and dangerous stunts.
7240	1	a	Hoffman and Linney bring a credible blend of ease and exasperation to the sibling relations, which show concern and competition in roughly equal measure. [DVD]
7241	7	a	In a way, the movie is about everything and nothing, but its real problem has less to do with its philosophical ambition than with its scattered, half-digested musings.
7242	5	a	Spectacular but not scary or thrilling.
7243	0	a	A joyful sequel, one of the best films of the year. 
7244	4	a	"In a cinematic landscape that favours wisecracking motormouths and polished but increasingly generic CGI, Early Man's sweet-natured slapstick and endearingly ""primitive"" look feel like a welcome counterbalance."
7245	5	a	I yperstylizarismeni kinimatografikotita poy koybalaei o Max Payne os paradosi sta video games, sta ohi kai toso ikana na ti heiristoyn heria toy Moore, metatrepetai oriaka se parodia, poy plakonei tin tainia toy me mia akathorista atheliti hlapatsa dithe
7246	3	a	Rocky Balboa meets Donnie Brasco.
7247	4	a	Black has captured the spirit of that bygone era of adrenaline-junkie junk without getting all retro-fussy about it.
7248	5	a	Every emotion is negated by another, until we're left with nothing but the mess we were presented from the start. Capernaum, indeed.
7249	4	a	The most adult of the new wave of superhero dramas.
7250	6	a	Newcomers will be less pleased, discovering a product that looks and feels like a scaled-up television show. The inside jokes and receiving line of nudge-wink cameos only adds to the small-screen feel.
7251	1	a	A triumph of art design and stop-motion animation.
7252	5	a	An ordinary, forgettable horror film. Even the Devil deserves more than this.
7253	5	a	When I first wrote the headline for this review, I accidentally wrote, THE DO-DO LIST. I have never been so right.
7254	5	a	Rarely has so much of so little consequence been so closely examined.
7255	5	a	It feels no more authentic than Stauffenberg's glass eyeball.
7256	4	a	Thank goodness for Nivola ... who makes a charming degenerate, and McDormand in her sexiest role to date. They make up for a bunch of sins.
7257	9	a	It's repetitive mayhem as usual.
7258	4	a	An elusive but dazzlingly sleazy examination of addiction, selfishness, greed and self-destruction in the California sun.
7259	2	a	Finally a fair and balanced report, a satire on the foibles of the political left and right alike.
7260	5	a	Disappointing drama that's let down by a plodding script, painfully slow pacing, a number of emotional misfires and an atrocious child performance.
7261	0	a	This epic elegy to family and country is a towering work of narrative fiction.
7262	5	a	...a total cheat.
7263	3	a	[N]ot quite as strong as Hero but several bravura sequences make it well worth seeing just the same.
7264	1	a	A film so sardonically dark, you won't know what hit you. This is a firecracker of a masterpiece that will have you ducking for cover.
7265	0	a	Not only is it a highly entertaining and astounding achievement in modern filmmaking, but it also represents a career milestone for director Ridley Scott and star Russell Crowe.
7266	4	a	This tale of a teenager coming out is at once old fashioned and cutting edge. 
7267	3	a	Field's charm rises to the top, turning Doris' many neuroses into a fully realized and tenderly sympathetic character.
7268	3	a	This drama about a massacre in Yemen takes on unexpected interest because the main character, a fiery-eyed Marine combat hero played by Samuel L. Jackson, is presented as a believably flawed man.
7269	5	a	Every gross baby joke imaginable is wedged into the story -- with mishaps involving diapers, breast milk, castor oil and rectal thermometers. It's supposed to be hilarious because the infant is actually a grown man. Really, it's just creepy.
7270	0	a	Who would have thought that it would be a master of fantasy like Steven Spielberg who would direct what might be the most wrenching film ever made?
7271	3	a	With a few edits Thunderball could have been one of the best Bond films, but as it is, it's still one of the better ones.
7272	0	a	One of the best films about an artist, if not the best.
7273	3	a	An impeccably tight movie about a French kindergarten teacher, where every scene serves the story
7274	9	a	The different characters' motivations are sucked into a vacuum which is only punctuated by moments of extreme and quite abhorrent violence.
7275	1	a	an enthralling picture that nearly overflows with the same kinds of breathtakingly beautiful action sequences that have now become Zhang's calling card.
7276	3	a	All I know is I laughed myself silly. Judge me if you must.
7277	4	a	Tasteless, one-joke sex comedy.
7278	4	a	Kids who realize they're fully ordinary -- that is, pretty much all of them -- will be pleased to see a world they recognize on the big screen.
7279	4	a	Bland and forgettable -- a romantic comedy with affable characters and some funny lines, but where love never really takes flight. It fizzles when it should sizzle.
7280	4	a	"Superficially satisfying but oftentimes disappointing, ""Hereafter"" focuses on three major stories, one of which works far better than the other two. "
7281	3	a	"Anderson is an auteur's auteur, and his movies are always lovingly shot and uniquely conceived. ""Inherent Vice"" is no different."
7282	5	a	The only problem for me was that the plot failed to grab the attention the way the visuals did: a very involved storyline about terrorists and a biological weapon went on at least a half-hour too long.
7283	7	a	If the first rule of Fight Club is 'Nobody talks about Fight Club,' a fitting subsection might be 'Why would anyone want to?'
7284	3	a	The mix of emotionally rich humour and sheer bawdy pleasures makes Knocked Up one of the finest Hollywood comedies for years. If you have someone special in your life, this just maybe the best date movie ever.
7285	5	a	With the exception of Charlize Theron's masterful performance as Wuornos, the film is a misguided mess.
7286	4	a	There are potentially interesting characters that go underdeveloped and even more potentially fascinating ideas that are given short shrift.
7287	3	a	An uneven yet generally skillful effort that has probably drawn more praise and criticism than it warrants.
7288	3	a	Passionate, atmospheric entertainment.
7289	3	a	If you're up for it, you'll discover a fresh, funny little romp unafraid to tackle the biggest issues of all.
7290	6	a	Slight, but colorful and forward-moving... Wasabi has the cheeky verve and heart of a shaggy dog movie that is aiming to please its owner, nothing more, nothing less.
7291	6	a	An affectionate and tender family film...
7292	3	a	"Early Man"" isn't the most original movie ever made, but it made me laugh and it sent me home with an idiot grin on my face. These days I take what I can get, and so should you."
7293	5	a	Young children and adults with high pain thresholds will enjoy the movie during its brief pause on the way to your On Demand menu.
7294	4	a	Far from a home run with some major snags including pacing and emotional detachment at the beginning of the movie, but the film still manages to resonate as a story about a woman of great power fighting to lead amongst men.
7295	3	a	The wisecracks fly fast and furious.
7296	4	a	Toplined by handsome Brit thesp Rupert Graves, offbeat serio comedy concerns the evolving friendhsip and eventual love between a rambunctious macho and a quiet insecure transsexual.
7297	9	a	This Crank sequel fails to live up to the original in every way and that one didn't exactly set a high bar to begin with.
7298	3	a	Invokes the mood of an early Fellini film as it swirls through the troubled recollections of a film director, played by Mr. Allen.
7299	4	a	There are just too many main characters for any of them to develop any depth, too many shots of casino signs sparkling in the night, and too little pace and plot to pull the whole thing together.
7300	9	a	The movie is way too long, way too dull and way too unfunny.
7301	1	a	...old fashioned and sentimental...clearly a labor of love.
7302	3	a	A Most Wanted Man has a veracity most spy thrillers lack, and the suspense is of the intellectual, not visceral, kind.
7303	3	a	... Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri is a multi-layered piece with such swathes of great dialogue that it will no doubt reward - if not demand - multiple viewings.
7304	0	a	Gorgeous to behold, the film also devastates with its meticulous portrait of impassioned lovers against whom fate conspires so mightily.
7305	4	a	A popcorn popper, a cinematic sugar buzz. And blessedly so.
7306	5	a	Predictable at best and just plain dull most of the time.
7307	9	a	The funniest thing about One Million Ways ...? How come McFarlane was much more convincing as Ted than he is here as a real person.
7308	5	a	The effort is sincere and the results are honest, but the film is so bleak that it's hardly watchable.
7309	5	a	The very idea of Jane Austen with a broken heart may be thought vulgar and pedantic by her modern readers, and the way the story pans out is not convincing.
7310	7	a	"Perhaps the movie should have been called ""Four Bridesmaids and a Hookah."
7311	3	a	Great little film, well worth finding.
7312	6	a	Mr. Gibson has plucked at the rawest of nerves yet I cannot blame him. He is expressing himself through the medium of film and using the text of his bible as the basis.
7313	3	a	A tough, post-punk Tintin-meets-Klute for the Occupy Wall Street set, this kinetic, hard-edged thriller is the perfect festive comedown for Fincher fans and dysfunctional families everywhere.
7314	1	a	Though Jarmusch is fond of deflecting gestalt reads of his films individually and collectively, make no mistake that there is a meticulous structure.
7315	6	a	Isn't clever or inventive enough to seem like a high-stakes game.
7316	4	a	The most interesting elements of Li's story -- dance, politics, and the politics of dance -- have been dulled from their source material, though not beyond recognition.
7317	5	a	All the corn pone in Mississippi can't make this go down like anything but year-old grits.
7318	5	a	With the exception of Lang's terrific performance as the perplexed Stonewall Jackson, the rest of the extensive cast is basically on cruise control.
7319	8	a	"Betray Devour Invade"" would have been a more appropriate title. "
7320	5	a	If you haven't yet seen the first film, rent that instead, or, better yet, go pick up a volume of the original Addams cartoons.
7321	4	a	The dialogue can be stagey and Venice is evoked at a tourist level, but it's beautifully photographed and Hepburn's loneliness and sadness look disquietingly real.
7322	4	a	The last hour of this movie is pretty much nonstop, and it's a gas.
7323	4	a	So what if much of it doesn't add up? It's still kind of fun and is embellished with clever cinematic flourishes.
7324	1	a	One of the most honest and heartfelt teen dramas ever to grace the screen.
7325	3	a	To serve and protect... and blow your face off with a shotgun.
7326	5	a	It feels like a puzzle with some significant pieces missing.
7327	4	a	Gorgeously dark with heartbreaking moments, American Pastoral isn't smart enough to have the prestige factor it's clearly going for.
7328	0	a	A strong candidate for Steven Spielberg's best film...
7329	4	a	The movie is clearly more for the diehard fans and they likely will get more out of this experience than the mildly curious.
7330	5	a	"Paper Heart wallows in that irritating hipster preciousness known as ""twee"" for nearly its entire running time."
7331	6	a	There's enough here to make I Am a Fugitive From a Chain Gang worthwhile, but its problems are deep enough to keep it a long way from sniffing greatness.
7332	3	a	One of the best American films of the year, even if you do feel more impatient with McCandless than Penn seems to.
7333	3	a	This is a quirky and surprisingly low-key comedy that's more amusing than funny; it's witty, but rarely hilarious.
7334	4	a	An old-fashioned and bittersweet tale about romance.
7335	5	a	A dud, that has a few bright spots.
7336	6	a	What you miss in both Defiance and Valkyrie is inner conflict. Their protagonists have not an instant of self-doubt. They're figures in historical pageants, not characters in a drama.
7337	2	a	What the movie gets right, sometimes in agonizing detail, are the humiliations and horrors of school...
7338	3	a	Removing the colour from the film also removes any hint of contemporary glamour or digitized studio syrup, and boldly places us in new dimension where we're forced to look and listen to people who look and sound a lot like us.
7339	3	a	The secret becomes obvious early in the film...so thankfully there's one thing even more crucial to the movie: Johnny Depp.
7340	4	a	Nothing tremendous, but a decent bit of relatively charming and diversionary entertainment.
7341	4	a	Comedy for grown-ups that sometimes struggles with its ambitious brief, but always remembers that the best laughs contain the odd shard of shrapnel.
7342	6	a	By the time we reach the interminable third act and its action movie climax, it's clear Flightplan never should have gotten off the ground.
7343	3	a	...Cassavetes has crafted a film that will hold your interest until the end.
7344	3	a	Tension and high emotional level of the players is the style of Cassavetes' docudrama and, for the most part, it works toward keeping you fascinated with a truly singular case in the annals of drug crime.
7345	9	a	Like its star, the movie is loud, tactless and spectacularly unfunny.
7346	3	a	"A reporter is never the story - the story is the story. But if looking at the reporter helps you see the story, and the human beings the story is about, then the effort may be worth it. ""A Private War"" is worth it."
7347	6	a	Asks us to believe the terrorists would, after slaughtering countless people, risk their entire plan--and their very lives--on...well, I won't say. But from my vantage point, it was ridiculous.
7348	6	a	Ghost Dog himself is so remote and focused on his path, it's hard to drum up a lot of identification or sympathy.
7349	3	a	No, we probably didn't need another biopic about a white boxer succeeding against all odds, but you could do a lot worse than this one. 
7350	6	a	A fluffy, dopey, but occasionally likable romantic comedy.
7351	7	a	When, oh when, will the scorching on-screen chemistry between Vince Vaughn and Jon Favreau finally be consummated?
7352	3	a	We know what will happen and it's still riveting.
7353	4	a	While it's a disappointment compared to a lot of other animated films, it's not entirely bad.
7354	6	a	"Paper Towns"" is a case where the supporting characters are more likable than the two young leads."
7355	3	a	This documentary is only partly a story of the chosen one; mainly, and more intriguingly, it's a chronicle of the choosing one, of the nervous young monk charged with the job of leading the search party.
7356	2	a	If a movie could strut, Logan Lucky would look like Travolta in Saturday Night Fever, so confident in its ability to impress and to please its audience with its entertaining heist hijinks. 
7357	1	a	A collaborative triumph in which the right actresses in the right roles respond to Sayles' ever-gentle touch.
7358	4	a	It remains watchable in spite of some rum narrative and performances from kids that woudn't get them a gig as extras on Byker Grove.
7359	9	a	We all know a movie like this isn't appealing to anyone beside the folks who grew up during that time. And even they will be compelled to cringe at its mention...
7360	9	a	Jim Jarmusch has come up with an unusual and unique product. Unfortunately, the film's erratic tone severely detracts from its few positive qualities.
7361	9	a	The film's disjointed plot and stock characters feel like a flat, lifeless knock off of better animated films that have come before it.
7362	3	a	Its feminist perspective checkmates the frat-boy misogyny and machismo that too often mar films set in combat zones.
7363	9	a	Cosmopolis is, for the most part and without mincing words, an astonishingly boring drama that marks the latest misfire for a once rock-solid filmmaker...
7364	4	a	Lee's use of High Frame Rate technology becomes a literal window into Billy Lynn's head. We're not supposed to feel comfortable. 
7365	1	a	The Imitation Game is a story that needed to be told; the highest compliment I can give Mr. Tyldum, Mr. Cumberbatch, Mr. Moore and their collaborators is that they've honoured Alan Turing. 
7366	6	a	What you would end up with if you took Orwell, Bradbury, Kafka, George Lucas and the Wachowski Brothers and threw them into a blender. But that's just the problem with it - the director hasn't added enough of his own ingredients.
7367	2	a	Walking precariously between real world gravitas and the far too isolated and idiosyncratic, The Savages is a wonderful premise undermined by some unnecessary pretense.
7368	3	a	That rare thing: a movie that makes you feel good by sharing some of your pain.
7369	1	a	Cate Blanchett is outstanding as a married woman who falls for a younger woman. As that younger woman, Rooney Mara is even better.
7370	3	a	A brilliant, underrated comedy, featuring one of the more inspired comic screenplays in recent years. It established David O. Russell as a major voice in Hollywood.
7371	4	a	It's not bad, but it is a bit odd and I can't see it thoroughly satisfying any audience, bar those now-adult Pooh fans in their own gloomy forests.
7372	2	a	Bodi is a likeable hero and it is fun to see his cheery optimism paired with the burned-out, cynical Angus. 
7373	5	a	"All this hoopla about Eminem's so great, is it any more of a stretch than Prince in ""Purple Rain"" or Babs in ""A Star is Born"" or Woody in any movie where he's having an affair with a younger woman?"
7374	3	a	An intimate, warm embrace of a film.
7375	8	a	It tries to be a sappy love story, an incredibly vile gross-out comedy and an envelope-pushing soft-core porno movie all at once. It ends up being an unappealing abomination.
7376	4	a	The extraterrestrials get title billing but Hoffman steals the show.
7377	6	a	Aca-nough already.
7378	7	a	Never before have two such skilled actors been so monstrously squandered in a movie so replete with failed gags and pathetic gaffes.
7379	5	a	The Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles series comes to a close with an installment that ultimately falls right in line with its subpar predecessors...
7380	5	a	with the retelling of legends, aspects of the story are emphasized or smothered in reaction to the temper of the times, that this one eschews politics for romance and spectacle is no more or less valid than earlier versions, just far less well told.
7381	1	a	Carol is a haunting motion picture - the kind of film that stays with the viewer long after the multiplex's neon signage has disappeared from the rear-view mirror.
7382	1	a	Climb into this rig and you'll be sweating bullets.
7383	6	a	For those who vehemently debate whether a Spinosaurus can outfight a T-Rex, this movie will comfortably pass your time -- or devour it.
7384	3	a	Urgent and pungent.
7385	4	a	Sturdy, serviceable and ultimately forgettable.
7386	2	a	It's a throwback to a time long before the torture porn and found-footage movies that have dominated the genre for the past decade, to a time when horror was allowed to be classy.
7387	3	a	Moving, often hilarious examination of masculine frustration with a sharply observed script and impressive performances from its cast.
7388	3	a	As a collegue told me...it'll do disapointing box office...only about half a billion.....See it.
7389	4	a	It won't win [Sayles] many converts, but even the least of his efforts is worth a look.
7390	1	a	A complex film that is going to appeal to moviegoers on different levels.
7391	6	a	'The Break-Up' breaks down in the end
7392	3	a	While the package as a whole never truly strikes a consistent tone, the boundless energy, surprisingly irreverent dialogue, and creative action sequences carry the day.
7393	2	a	Messy, but with great musical performances.
7394	0	a	A good chunk of Three Billboards is about redemption and how people are stubbornly complex, able to be many things at once. A man can be good and noble and still be prideful in ways that deprive children of a father.
7395	3	a	Even though it may not be Almodovar's best film, it is still eminently watchable and thoroughly enjoyable.
7396	3	a	When Amadeus deals with the music -- and with the theme of greater and lesser talents in conflict -- it frequently justifies its reputation.
7397	3	a	Movies about exotic travel tend to reduce locals to unknowable Others. 'Embrace of the Serpent' doesn't want to do that.
7398	6	a	Spielberg may not have been the best choice to direct this feminist text, making a clean, neat movie that lacks authenticity, but the movie has many touching moments and the entire female ensemble is good, particularly Whoopi Goldberg in the second half
7399	3	a	Even hobbled as he is by a character he doesn't entirely get, and Peter Hunt's antagonistic direction, and the film's annoying tendency to remind us of Connery... George azenby puts up a good fight.
7400	9	a	Watching the bleach blonde actress prance around the steep hills of Seattle in skintight pastel skirt suits wobbling atop sky-high stilettos is almost more than one should have to bare.
7401	4	a	There's not enough here for a full length feature film - something that becomes obvious the longer the movie is on the screen.
7402	3	a	Movies like Christopher Robin don't come around that often any more, and they're good for the soul.
7403	5	a	Jane Got A Gun shows momentary glimpses into low-key excitement, but the movie is too languidly structured and without captivating enough characters to result in the satisfyingly succinct burst of entertainment that its title suggests.
7404	2	a	[Robin William's] most grandiose holiday greeting yet.
7405	3	a	An uncomfortable but significant success.
7406	0	a	A great work by a great artist doing things that great art should do - making us think, feel and reflect.
7407	2	a	Intriguing documentary narrated by the slain rapper himself.
7408	2	a	Southern hospitality sees a whole new light in this pulpy romp.
7409	4	a	"Whedon figures, probably correctly, that fans of ""Firefly"" don't need detailed introductions to the regular characters. The rest of us do. "
7410	2	a	[Soderbergh's] big-screen comeback, Logan Lucky, finds him taking the relatively easy option of the lighthearted heist movie, something he's always done well.
7411	0	a	A brilliant, sprawling piece of cinematic art, and perhaps the best film of the year.
7412	3	a	Plays more like an expanded short story than a full-blown novel, but it's still a game worth playing.
7413	2	a	A stylish Japanese effort adapted from a popular manga that blends the thematic substance of a Toho Samurai epic with the quicksilver visceral assault of a Shaw Brothers Wuxia swordsman saga.
7414	0	a	Carries its predecessor's torch into darker, quixotic territories, bursting at the seams with folkloric witticism and hellzapoppin' imagery.
7415	5	a	Taking Woodstock fails to achieve anything beyond a contact high because of Martin's listless performance as the central character.
7416	5	a	Debbie Reynolds, then in her second and last popularity phase, plays the titular role in this unbearably cloying, poorly scripted musical melodrama, trying to cash in on the success of The Sound of Music.
7417	1	a	A stirring, brutal and sad examination of the bleak cycle of violence and pain.
7418	0	a	A classic that stays with the audience long after the closing credits conclude.
7419	3	a	Without making a fuss as a ham-fisted issues film, this is a quietly important Hollywood movie that should hopefully lead the way for more diverse mainstream stories to come.
7420	5	a	A massive waste of time and a glaring missed opportunity.
7421	5	a	Expertly made but strangely uninvolving.
7422	4	a	Given the deadly stakes, this should be gripping, but the film gets sucked into academic plot details, trudging through each rendezvous and stakeout.
7423	6	a	"I Origins"" slows down the longer it goes on, and the last half hour drifts into vagueness. The climax is dramatically inert and depends on the soundtrack to convince us that it's actually happening."
7424	4	a	A witchy brew of laughs and chills energizes this family Halloween treat.
7425	6	a	Don't expect anything of depth and you won't be disappointed by this predigested pabulum.
7426	8	a	One of the worst plots I've ever seen in a time travel story.
7427	5	a	It's a mighty awkward adaptation for such an uncomplicated project...
7428	6	a	This is lowest common dominator filmmaking in every sense of the word, which shouldn't come as any surprise to anyone familiar with the oeuvre of director Dennis Dugan.
7429	3	a	It's so well made that Bleed for This won me over despite my aversion to timeworn sports pictures that tell basically the same story.
7430	6	a	Culkin is never really very believable in his role, though Wood does better, lending depth to a sketchily written character.
7431	2	a	In the end, Rango, despite its many pleasures, is a bit too smart for its own good.
7432	6	a	If you were to review Brian De Palma's Snake Eyes in just one word, it would have to be the sound of air being let out of a balloon: Pfffffffft.
7433	7	a	The first three minutes are inventive.
7434	2	a	Good-naturedly bludgeons its audience with old-fashioned alien-invasion hysteria.
7435	4	a	A solid, slightly old-fashioned drama.
7436	8	a	It's an off-the-rack CGI-animated effort that wastes considerable vocal talent on a tired concept, only content to gift fans what they expect, and nothing more.
7437	5	a	If the plot line doesn't leave you numb with disbelief, the excessive explosive outbursts and viscerally edited dismemberments will drop you, or someone you care about, wet in the seat.
7438	6	a	Crimson Peak's disjointed, laggy storyline renders it second-tier del Toro. Which is, of course, first-tier anyone else.
7439	7	a	Jerry Seinfeld's disappointing labor of animated-movie love is more of a lukewarm handholding experience than a full embrace.
7440	3	a	Button-cute.
7441	9	a	No matter how respected a celebrity is, watching him or her jabber about caffeine's stimulative power is not revealing.
7442	4	a	Uneven, but never less than entertaining.
7443	5	a	Enjoy the stunning South Pacific views, but don't expect some enchanted evening.
7444	6	a	"You watch ""Country Strong"" wishing you were watching ""Crazy Heart,"" and wondering whether Gwyneth Paltrow read the script all the way through, and wishing Bridges would turn up to show the folks how it's done."
7445	6	a	The movie barely amounts to more than a homage.
7446	5	a	Faithfully and fatally committed to producing a gross out comedy that undeniably grosses
7447	7	a	The director, Ryan Murphy, brings only the most obvious sentiments to the borderline intolerable proceedings.
7448	2	a	It's one of the better 'women pictures,' though it got too weepie, mushy and full of itself for me.
7449	9	a	Clearly, Pat Proft was wearing too many hats, and both his writing and his directing suffered for it.
7450	3	a	Did this retelling--both epic and intimate, lush and brutal--really need to wrap itself up with a PBS-worthy montage?
7451	3	a	The film is worthy of both your attention and of the Tolkien legendarium in which Jackson, his actors and his Weta Workshop technical crew are so firmly situated.
7452	3	a	An awfully well-made film. Brilliant performances are most typified by Bosco's often perfectly incoherent portrayal of a man slipping farther and farther out of touch.
7453	0	a	There is more unexpectedly moving, palpable, identifiable jeopardy and danger for these animated characters than in much of the recent low-rate live-action superhero junk.
7454	4	a	The film's con is written in everything from the sometimes tongue-in-cheek dialogue to the retro songs that make the story difficult to place on an actual timeline.
7455	5	a	When did Vin Diesel start making Nic Cage movies?
7456	4	a	The script and acting make this little thriller better than you think it will be.
7457	4	a	A mediocre movie with a good one trapped inside.
7458	6	a	The Burial Society is definitely big on plot, but can the thing dance? Short answer: It's no Astaire.
7459	5	a	Much of the film, burdened by unnecessary, obvious narration, is an overly languid, dully paced prelude to the main event...
7460	3	a	"Tupac: Resurrection"" is one of the most eerie documentaries you'll ever see."
7461	3	a	Teller's work is the film's soul, and he completely convinces us of Vinny's affability, flaws and steely determination.
7462	6	a	A case of having your cheesecake and eating it, too.
7463	6	a	It's basically just a bunch of guys thinking up the stupidest things they can possibly do. And then doing them.
7464	1	a	No, I refuse to label it a comedy. I refuse to classify it so easily. As far as I'm concerned, this is a movie about humanity.
7465	3	a	Only the idiosyncratic Warner Brothers would give us a wide-release summer movie that turns out to be an acid western.
7466	3	a	Affecting, lovable romcom about gay teen has a little edge.
7467	1	a	It's exemplary business as usual for Nebraska, a beautiful, bittersweet comedy-drama.
7468	3	a	The Polish brothers make an auspicous debut, and establish a tone -- like it or not, they've delivered on it since then.
7469	2	a	it holds together through the performances and a stylistic integrity; Coppola's voice is quiet but firm.
7470	1	a	A strange and most challenging film
7471	7	a	A miasma of vanity envelops America's Sweethearts where wit ought to reign.
7472	9	a	A historically suspect picture of the Chess Records legend.
7473	6	a	Folks, he's literally old enough to be her grandfather.
7474	1	a	Intelligent, muscular documentary filmmaking that asks all the right questions about anti-Semitism today.
7475	3	a	It can test the patience of a viewer. But the beauty of the images and the underlying power of the story, especially when Beatriz begins to emerge as the focus of the film, make Vazante an immersive watch.
7476	3	a	"Directed and co-written by Andrew Stanton of ""Finding Nemo,"" ""Toy Story"" and ""Monsters, Inc."" fame, the fun but sometimes confusing ""John Carter"" may launch the next big sci-fi-adventure franchise. "
7477	3	a	Period piece or not, Psycho further extends the current screen cycle devoted to professional male malaise Office Space, Fight Club, American Beauty.
7478	6	a	The pervading feeling throughout Matchstick Men is that it's just subtly off.
7479	1	a	The film's period decor, mood lighting and artful camerawork are beautiful, at times thrilling, to look at.
7480	3	a	Sharply written, bloody, and darkly funny, this is a cut above your usual exploitation fare.
7481	5	a	A fascinating train wreck of a horror movie.
7482	3	a	This witty, wily battle between genders is not so much about sexual harassment as it is about power politics in the workplace, where water-cooler gossip is replaced by E-mail, and where memo warfare is waged by combatants in virtual-reality goggles.
7483	3	a	an intensely intimate and personal experience
7484	6	a	A meandering, pointless disappointment from the normally exceptional Eastwood. 
7485	6	a	...there's nothing terribly compelling about watching likable stars argue for close to two hours.
7486	3	a	An utterly charming work of pure pop exuberance, Bandslam is full of unexpected pleasures set to a surprisingly retro soundtrack.
7487	5	a	A brilliant idea and two enjoyably over-the-top central performances, but an ultimately disappointing one-joke movie.
7488	1	a	Like the excellent original, this worthy sequel is similarly distinguished by some memorable set-pieces, superb dialogue, and smashing performances.
7489	3	a	David O. Russell's latest entertaining ode to lovable characters you should probably be afraid of. 
7490	3	a	It's a little too forgiving of his more serious character flaws, and it skirts some of the more unpleasant aspects of his life, but it's a moving tribute in the end.
7491	1	a	[The] film is as bleak and unsparing as the world's end premise demands. It's also utterly transfixing from start to finish and elevated by the unexpectedly superb pairing of stars Guy Pearce and Robert Pattinson.
7492	6	a	"It's hard to expect anyone to infuse much passion into a ""by-the-numbers"" boxing movie which telegraphs every punch."
7493	9	a	Nothing gels here, because the screenplay provides no logic or motivation.
7494	2	a	In a dominant era for family-friendly animation, Sausage Party is a bold rebuttal needing more than shock laughs.
7495	4	a	A Perfect Getaway isn't perfect, but Timothy Olyphant makes it entertaining.
7496	6	a	This film would have made a terrific short. Director Joe Wright [Atonement] was given the impossible task of making something bigger than it needed to be.
7497	3	a	..more a ministry tool than entertainment, but it is an encouraging development in the ongoing struggle against Hollywood hegemony.
7498	5	a	What went wrong? The script is a bit dodgy and the actors seem to be going through the motions.
7499	5	a	It's like a video game - the visual effects and the setting are carefully constructed, but without that core element provided by the player: a reason to care.
7500	1	a	a perfect hybrid of French noir elegance and the New Wave's rough hewn realism
7501	6	a	...tries too self consciously to connect the old crew to the newer one and never quite makes a smooth transition.
7502	3	a	This feels like a classic case of a B movie showing its more heavily hyped A-list competition how to get the job done with little fuss or fanfare.
7503	4	a	Although somewhat predictable, labored and gimmicky, Tennant's narrative is given a boisterous boost by its charismatic leading rogue in Will Smith.
7504	4	a	What's so awful about taking a breather? It's enough to bask in the pastoral prettiness and the unexpected harmony of Seyfried and Redgrave.
7505	7	a	The result is ugly, confusing and boring.
7506	9	a	As hard as it tries - and, oh boy, does it try - The Vanishing of Sidney Hall is a film of artistic flourishes looking for a story it has no real clue how to tell.
7507	5	a	If the film had met the expectations so well laid down by the advertising campaign, we would have a top-notch thriller on our hands.
7508	5	a	Beautifully-shot frames and a half decent score do not equal a good film if it cannot engage the audience emotionally.
7509	4	a	Cute and clever enough to enchant little girls -- not to mention their mothers.
7510	6	a	Leave it to Steven Spielberg to turn the end of the world into a treatise on responsible parenting.

7514	7	a	A sluggish courtroom melodrama relieved only by unintenional laughter.
7515	1	a	...an achingly funny portrayal of a high schooler in search of that rarest of jewels: a confident sense of self.
7516	3	a	"Mike White's deft combination of serious subject matter and dark, funny humor make """"The Good Girl"" a film worth watching."
7517	6	a	Like its subject's fateful voyage?, Ghosts of the Abyss makes it about two-thirds of the way to its port before sinking.
7518	1	a	Dern makes Woody as cantankerous as he is clueless, bobbing and weaving to avoid his inevitable mortality, but there's a purity about him that'll break your heart.
7519	5	a	A brash, sarcastic just-about-family-friendly adventure. 
7520	4	a	You'd have to be pretty full of seasonal humbug to resist this ...
7521	3	a	Dark, interesting and downright weird film that plays like a teen movie filtered through the work of David Lynch.
7522	4	a	Far from unwatchable, this provocative film is still haunting and irritating me days later, and that's probably the best reaction any artist could hope to elicit with his works.
7523	3	a	Alrafeea is a revelation as the energetic, foul-mouthed Zain, beautifully delivering a spontaneous energy that feels as though its plucked right off the streets moments before the cameras roll.

7525	3	a	his movie isn't perfect.... Yet Mr. Herzog and writer William M. Finkelstein have crafted an extremely entertaining film, a genre piece that at times looks made for the art house.

7528	1	a	McDormand, carrying the movie on blue-denimed shoulders, is a wonder.

7534	3	a	I'm grateful for movies that truly want to entertain, rather than drown the audience with special effects and marketing gimmicks.
7535	3	a	Lehman's delightfully dark and deranged take on adolescent angst and isolation. Heathers is heuristic in its haughty examination of teenaged alienation

7541	5	a	The film maintains a sufficiently pleasant comic vibe as the couples bicker and pick away at each other, but director Peter Billingsley never really brings matters to a satisfying boil.

7545	3	a	Possible signs of the apocalypse: a rain of fire, return of the Messiah, my enjoy ing a Martin Lawrence comedy.
7546	4	a	Credited writers Gregg Chabot, Kevin Peterka and Matt Greenberg took their dialogue from every action movie you've seen, and characterizations don't amount to a hill of dragon dung.
7547	0	a	A moon-drenched eastern European fairy tale perfectly rendered onto film.
7548	4	a	Beautiful, but lacking WWII saga about a boy.
7549	2	a	The film is obtuse, talky, remote and sometimes baffling, but it is also full of ideas and Cronenberg's uncompromising belief in the art of cinema. Imagine that.
7550	4	a	Though it looks like it was made for two nickels, I Am David resonates strongly in the heart, which is all this film is truly going after.
7551	2	a	No matter the tonal peaks and valleys, Talk to Me brings Greene's attitude to the big screen with confidence, led by Cheadle's amazing performance.
7552	0	a	You leave the film's soft-grained world reluctantly, as if taking off a warm coat when it's still a little chilly inside.

7569	3	a	It's ultimately David Fincher's perfectionist talent for creating a gripping aesthetic that raises this film above your average James Patterson adaptation.
7570	3	a	The Incredibles isn't. It's a good movie, but it isn't the incredible type of picture we've come to expect from Pixar.
7571	2	a	Like a production of When Harry Met Sally put on by the characters from One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest. Silver Linings uses cliches like a straight-jacket, containing an otherwise nutty film and making it safe for audiences to approach.
7572	4	a	The characters' behaviour rings true, the tension is strong and the oily darkness of it all looks good.
7573	4	a	See Benjamin Button. Why not? It's still better than most movies in the world.
7574	4	a	Jackson has delivered plenty more of the big setpieces that fans loved in the trilogy, albeit at the cost of making The Hobbit far more imperial and epic than it needs to be.
7575	5	a	Writer-director Goran Dukic, adapting an Etgar Keret novel, may be too successful in establishing suicideland as a fate worse than death. It really is an empty, dreadful place.
7576	6	a	Well, visually Rango looks excellent. Then characters start talking.
7577	3	a	Destined, almost certainly, to become a queer film classic. [Full Review in Spanish]
7578	3	a	Thrilling opening sequence with implausible feats of derringdo? Check. Scenery chewing psychopathic villain? Check.
7579	9	a	An aggressively obnoxious comedy.
7580	6	a	Like honey, Christopher Robin is very sweet. Unlike honey, it doesn't really stick.
7581	3	a	Steven Spielberg's engaging, heartfelt and well-made drama delves into a critical incident in the history of slavery in America.
7582	4	a	Positively explodes with a surfeit of pent-up creative energy that unfortunately doesn't know when to stop.
7583	9	a	Another Cronenberg film badly in need of an exploding head. 
7584	3	a	In a goofily endearing performance reminiscent of the young John Cusack, Connell is charming and relatable. Likewise, Kudrow, as the overprotective mother who both fears and wants more independence for her son.
7585	6	a	This is a sound bite satire for a war fought through them.
7586	2	a	A refreshingly hilarious raunchy comedy that proves that raunchy comedies can be fun. 
7587	0	a	This story is larger-than-life to begin with, so it is enhanced by the new super-size format. The movie grabs you and doesn't let go for nearly two hours.
7588	3	a	A focused, very good documentary instead of the great one that could have been crafted from this bizarre true tale with a bit more scope.
7589	3	a	"Winslet and Davis are formidable in ""The Dressmaker."
7590	0	a	A decade of overexposure still can't diminish its iconoclastic glee.
7591	3	a	A shout out to the bad boys of comedy for a film that's lewd and crude and brimming with attitude.
7592	4	a	Normally, I start to get the dry heaves when I see Dane Cook on the big screen, but this movie makes him likable
7593	3	a	Our Little Sister is not so much a dramatic work as a cinematic tone poem. The point of the movie is not to get anywhere in particular, but just to enjoy the journey along the way.
7594	3	a	The all-time great actor has given audiences one last parting gift: The chance to experience a performance unlike any he'd ever given; to see him again, anew.
7595	4	a	Quirky semi-documentary about love is cute for teens.
7596	5	a	The 'Polar Express'-style CG-meets-live-action visuals are creepy and flat, the characters are largely nonexistent and the story takes so many short cuts that it becomes meaningless...
7597	2	a	It isn't my favorite Nolan film, but it's better than most of the films I see.
7598	5	a	In the comic book tradition, the story weaves between the real and the mythical, but it's a very boozy trip. Brolin's intermittent voice-over narration proves to be the most powerful stuff, with the rest curiously sputtering.
7599	2	a	A psychological post-apocalyptic tale of a loner on a quest across barren Australia to take back his stolen car from a gang, The Rover is the Mad Max film David Lynch never made.
7600	5	a	Almost nothing about it feels drawn from real life.
7601	6	a	a moderately entertaining variation on the old gothic thriller
7602	3	a	Theron is not only unrecognizable with her peaches-and-cream complexion gone leathery and worn, it is her performance that is gutsy.
7603	3	a	Cassavetes once again shows he is brimming with talent with this psychologically violent film that is involving despite the inevitable outcome.
7604	2	a	Like a deep-fried Twinkie at the State Fair of Texas, Killer Joe is gooey, flavorful and bad for you. Dig in.
7605	4	a	Intense adult drama shocks but doesn't awe.
7606	3	a	Second in trilogy is a smooth but violent thriller.
7607	4	a	Some will appreciate the combination of vision and happenstance that led to the festival and its place in public consciousness as a marker for a generational shift.
7608	3	a	Those who love language and particularly poetic verse will savor the dialogue, as well as the visual splendor of the film. With its gorgeously framed shots and superb craftsmanship, Bright Star is a thing of beauty.
7609	6	a	Most children will get a kick out of it, although adults roped into accompanying their offspring may find themselves yearning to escape through the nearest exit.
7610	0	a	"Like the best movies often do, ""Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri"" leaves audiences with a complex set of emotions, and with a hard-to-define hint of the profound."
7611	3	a	If it takes a film about an animated sausage and a bun, laced with toilet humour and extreme sexual puns, to provide a modern-day existential critique of the lunacy of human nature and modern racial and religious discourse, then I'm all for it.
7612	7	a	Tyler Perry's The Single Moms Club is a lackluster empowerment fantasy that veers between dull and embarrassing.
7613	9	a	A nauseating child's nightmare of Sisyphean despair.
7614	4	a	Effective enough as a thriller and an indictment of sexism in its most brutal form.
7615	6	a	I found the film more numbing than moving, as if the transformation it charted was not from human to divine, but from man to carcass.
7616	9	a	The fourth film in the Predator franchise is also the fourth best Predator movie.
7617	1	a	Embarrassed myself about laughing out loud multiple times, I found myself enjoying the movie much more than I ever enjoyed the TV show...and these pseudo-homo-erotic stunts.
7618	1	a	Stylishly twisty turny
7619	9	a	Should have been a quest for a better script. Ridiculous, tedious, and lifeless. Characters a shadow of their former selves. A sad note for the franchise to end on.
7620	9	a	Blame It on Rio is not simply humorless. It also spreads gloom.
7621	5	a	...the rare time travel movie that does nothing interesting or clever with modern humans in an ancient setting...
7622	9	a	It is all so done and overdone, so regurgitated, so late-night TV and what-else-is-new-in-hell.
7623	3	a	The sheer fun generated by the characterizations will provide enough entertainment value for the average moviegoer.
7624	4	a	A yarn that is just entertaining enough for you to walk out of the theater satisfied, but not enough to have you begging for more.
7625	4	a	Your kids should have a ball watching this wacky seal behaving like a family dog, and any movie that can make your kids giggle is probably worthy of a look.
7626	4	a	It's a promising start...but where it's going to in the two remaining movies is anybody's guess.
7627	5	a	A lumpy three-and-a-half-hour glob of Civil War history.
7628	1	a	Ultimately, Adios transcends politics and proves once again that music knows no boundaries.
7629	5	a	What if you watch the tape twice, do you get three and a half days then? If you fast forward through it do you get fourteen? How about pausing it to go to the bathroom? Or only watching half, getting bored and turning it off?
7630	1	a	A wildly inventive kids' movie that doesn't pander to its audience, isn't full of potty humor, and teaches a good message.
7631	6	a	[While] Kelly Fremon Craig's first feature updates some old plot points by wrapping them up in current references -- a text message precipitates Nadine's first scene crisis -- it tends to be pretty much what you expect.
7632	6	a	Just as Mac and Me eventually devolved into a feature-length commercial for McDonald's, Harry and the Hendersons eventually emerges as a vegetarian screed.
7633	4	a	While horror newbies may find the unfolding incubus antics moderately scary, others will be distracted by the frankly terrifying levels of recycling ...
7634	1	a	"Everybody wins with ""War of the Worlds,"" a fast-paced summer blockbuster that will appeal to action, sci-fi and drama fans."
7635	3	a	Wisely, Lee anchors his movie with the appealing Alwyn, whose accessibility humanizes this war story loaded with one-dimensional characters.
7636	3	a	"Pedro Almodovar's ""Broken Embraces"" is a rapt essay in film-noir atmosphere -- the classic black-and-white fog of desperation, treachery and impending disaster -- which has been translated here in carefully calibrated color."
7637	8	a	Words that I never thought I'd type, but must after viewing Seth Rogen's take on The Green Hornet: I miss Van Williams. 
7638	4	a	Everything this picture does differently is a piece of a potentially exciting story, but there just isn't any glue to hold this model Enterprise together.
7639	6	a	This land of sweetness and light may appeal to many, but to some it is going to seem like living hell.
7640	5	a	Bow Wow's movie has no bark and no bite.
7641	4	a	It sees something inspirational, not psychotic, about its hero's punishing perseverance, his willingness to put his body through hell for the sake of glory.
7642	4	a	A high-gloss exploitation picture, obsessed with the Death Jesus conquered, rather than the Life he gave -- and gives.
7643	5	a	Feels unworthy of its stars' -- and its subjects' -- talents. 
7644	5	a	Aaron's Eckhart's solid performance can't make up for this feature's rotten script and its by-the-books third act.
7645	1	a	A heartrending slice of Americana both inspiring and foreboding in its view of a world that will exist long after we are all gone.
7646	4	a	Johansson's nearly deadpan deliveries are looking adaptable to a variety of roles, and the Nam character's stoned demeanor gets laughs in a variety of situations.
7647	4	a	What this comedy lacks in cleverness or originality it more than makes up for with charm.
7648	4	a	An incongruous jumble, American Hustle's supporting cast and Lawrence's stellar turn lingers in the eye, not the movie as a whole. For a film that perhaps attempted to break a mold, it suffers from simply not knowing what it wanted to be.
7649	3	a	Here is a model example of how TV footage and documentary interviews can both reconstruct an event and help us understand it.
7650	2	a	So what's an existentialist comedy? Basically, it's a silly, irreverent, chaotic metaphysical farce about what it means to be alive.
7651	2	a	There are some downsides, but you have enough laughs, so it's entertaining. I wouldn't throw the baby out with the bathwater, just go in knowing this is not the next classic romantic comedy.
7652	5	a	As Nelson Mandela, Morgan Freeman functions as a South African version of Charlie Chan, spouting fortune cookie-style wisdom in an appropriately wily manner that disarms the racial agitation of black and white foes alike.
7653	4	a	It's too bad that the movie isn't as vibrant, funny, and entertaining as the community it wishes to represent - but it's a start.
7654	7	a	Whether art-house, political, or American pop, First Reformed is in between styles in a way that's never satisfactory.
7655	9	a	Jonah Hex definitely appears to be making itself up as it goes along. 
7656	4	a	For all of its extraneous subplots and contrived scripting [the film's] got one decidedly potent weapon in the form of the fearless dynamo Melissa McCarthy.
7657	5	a	The kind of pandering family entertainment that would make even Walt Disney roll in his grave.
7658	2	a	Good for some laughs and some likable characters; Vaughn and Favreau stand out while Bateman fades into the background
7659	6	a	...there is little sense of wonder or excitement in Fantastic Four. It is merely a middling contender among a surplus of superhero movies.
7660	9	a	Maxwell, a TV movie director with no ear for dialogue that isn't over the top and no eye for the sort of visual poetry these stories demand, is plainly not up to the job.
7661	6	a	The movie has animals, kids and fine acting from Matt Damon and Scarlett Johansson, but it lacks the emotional honesty and unpredictability that made Crowe's early films so irresistible.
7662	4	a	Maybury tackles the great Dylan Thomas in The Edge of Love, a speculative investigation into a cloudy period of the poet and dramatist's personal life. [Blu-ray]
7663	4	a	Some strong action sequences, a consistent treat for the eyeballs and an early glimpse of the future of animation.
7664	1	a	The funniest, filthiest, and-as surprising as it may seem-shrewdest politically-minded film of this election year.
7665	7	a	Thought-provoking on a macro level in some of its interviews, but its sloppy construction, poor focus and rah-rah boosterism make for a sludgy viewing experience.
7666	9	a	This is almost mesmerisingly bad.
7667	3	a	Impressive conventional and competent PBS-like biopic on the romantic poet John Keats.
7668	5	a	Wonderland is in your face. Any deeper connections, like those to heart and mind, get lost in the splash.
7669	5	a	Much as they would like it to, basketball can't save the youthful inner-city players here. Nor does the ultra-fast-paced street version of the sport save this movie from predictability and tedium.
7670	4	a	If the essence of great comedy is truth then Knocked Up falls some way short.
7671	8	a	just goes through the motions of parodying one movie after another without any apparent stab at wit or humor
7672	3	a	Safety Not Guaranteed is an original worth seeking out.
7673	2	a	The Best of Youth more than earns its running time.
7674	3	a	Mann's aim seems to return an artistry to the cop drama, it's much the same high ambition he had two decades ago with his TV show the method is definitely different but the results are even more pleasing.
7675	3	a	...fans of slow-burn ghostly fare like Nicole Kidman's The Others and del Toro's own Don't Be Afraid of the Dark will enjoy the feel of their skin both crawling and tingling.
7676	0	a	Sorrentino is so often compared to Fellini that it feels right that he has made the city of 'La Dolce Vita' the focus for this heady, beautiful, entrancing film.
7677	3	a	"For better or worse, sometimes strictly for the sake of shock value, the stylish irreverence of ""Trainspotting"" mimics that drug high and delivers its own potent kick."
7678	3	a	At its best, the cast of Talk to Me coalesces into the Brotherhood of Keeping it Real.
7679	4	a	Another staggeringly strong performance by Javier Bardem.
7680	5	a	It might not seem quite so awful, even reprehensible, if it didn't waste a pretty good cast, or if it didn't trot out that ultimate poor-taste cliche, a child in peril.
7681	6	a	The sole saving grace of Wrong Turn is its honesty. You get exactly what you expect -- blood, guts and people being taken to the killing floor. But just because it's honest doesn't make it good.
7682	4	a	As fantasies go, you could do a lot worse.
7683	4	a	An utter disappointment and a delusion of a film. Stay away -- far away.
7684	2	a	Despite the tiresome plot, it's highly entertaining because of the snappy young duo and their big band music.
7685	9	a	[Director] Dunmore creates a memorably grimy London, but the moral grime covering the film proves less memorable.
7686	6	a	The air is thin in Vertical Limit, and so is the plot.
7687	2	a	For all the drama and comedy, nothing much really happens in it - other than the palpable maturation of nearly every character in less than two hours.
7688	2	a	A richly appointed period piece, it features kingly tantrums, mistresses, bodices, roaring fireplaces, incest, and mutton. It also features sharply enunciated, period-perfect dialogue in which nary a contraction can be heard.
7689	3	a	My only reservation about Caine is his less than credible Texas accent, especially since his brother's is so pronounced.
7690	6	a	Alpha Dog may have some of Larry Clark's territory, and even some of Tarantino's markings. But it's still a mutt. And no matter how much it marks its territory, it never finds its own way home.
7691	4	a	A flawed work held together by Alwyn's tender presence.
7692	0	a	A sci-fi classic that balances the cerebral with the entertaining.
7693	9	a	With a truly awkward script and no chemistry between the leads this Thanksgiving arrival is a turkey.
7694	3	a	This is Allen's movie debut, and it's easy to see why his show is a ratings smash. There's an effortless quality to his humor, but it's also got a quietly urgent edge to it.
7695	4	a	This film is a tough sell. But it's never less than daring, poised or deliberate. It doesn't go down easy, but it clings.
7696	1	a	"For what ""Daggers"" is, a chop-socky epic, it is a stunning work worthy of inclusion with the best of the genre."
7697	3	a	The movie's humor works best when the illogic of the TV show gets in the way.
7698	4	a	There's an almost evangelical, wave-of-the-future excitement to the film, promising more and better to come.
7699	5	a	Clearly, Crowe doesn't trust the audience to make it from Point A to Point B without stumbling or getting lost.
7700	0	a	Ever get that sinking feeling? You'll want to...and you'll like it.
7701	7	a	If the movie ... exhibits a loving eye for Manhattan exteriors, it's undone by its own rigidly old-fashioned conventions.
7702	6	a	...begins to feel like it comes from the one comic book even a comic-book geek would be embarrassed to be caught reading.
7703	5	a	If Mars Needs Moms had not have been produced using the mo-cap process -- which still hasn't fixed the problem where some folk have a spooky, neither-alive-nor-dead look -- it might have stood more chance of finding an audience.
7704	3	a	Just as impressive as Logan Lucky's technical proficiency is its winning embrace of fun. 
7705	3	a	A perfectly worthy entry to close, or perhaps resuscitate, cinema's greatest zombie series.
7706	3	a	In a way, this film talks out of both sides of its mouth -- lampooning and loving its targets at the same time. But most viewers, I suspect, won't mind.
7707	3	a	The acting is much above average for action films and takes advantage of the depth of an experienced actor like Bale.
7708	2	a	click to read review [Greek]
7709	2	a	Familiar but stylishly done thriller.
7710	5	a	Second-rate Fred Astaire film.
7711	6	a	Densely plotted, with everyone spying on everybody else, the movie is fraught with labyrinthine details more complicated than Egyptian hieroglyphics.
7712	3	a	Shults has both the instincts and the technical facility to make pretty much any kind of atypical picture he wants.
7713	3	a	Pike's unblinking, emphatic quality has its limitations, but by the film's midpoint she rolls with every scene. Fierce and alert, she holds the screen.
7714	5	a	A film that knows exactly where it wants to go, but plays out disappointingly forced and superficial in the execution.
7715	7	a	Mars Needs Moms is precisely the sort of mess that just grows more depressing the more one ruminates on it. 
7716	3	a	Doesn't everybody deserve a great love story?
7717	4	a	As minimalist horror movies go, this is pretty effective.
7718	6	a	May lack the pungent bite of its title, but it's an enjoyable trifle nonetheless.
7719	6	a	Hollywood's attempts to do the anime style never seem to get it ... That Astro Boy gets at least some of the elements right could be seen as some kind of triumph -- just not enough of one to induce us to recommend it.
7720	5	a	Eh
7721	5	a	Obvious, irritating boxing girl power movie.
7722	2	a	It's another compelling performance for the four-time Oscar nominee in a film that may sputter at times only to be lifted by Bening's stunning work.
7723	3	a	"Though ""The Infiltrator"" breaks no new ground in its storytelling, it is nonetheless a riveting piece of work."
7724	3	a	Featuring cinema's best bus-related stunt sequence, a spectacular finale in a shopping mall and, um, multiple instances of its star getting hit in the face with cake.
7725	1	a	A terrifically witty, refreshingly unpretentious science-fiction film with the least likely and most likable heroines in memory.
7726	5	a	Although the script lacks nuance or any real tension, Binder uses Costner effectively.
7727	2	a	"Fortunately, characters like Simon have ""the character"" to make the right choices."
7728	6	a	So enamored of its subject, legendary Italian fashion designer Valentino Garavani, that it almost loses sight of explaining why he's so great in the first place.
7729	5	a	Crimson Peak is a visually stunning mess.
7730	3	a	Love Simon is up there with your first kiss or first pancake on a Saturday morning; it's not perfect, but it's still sweet as hell. 
7731	3	a	A well-made thriller that echoes Alfred Hitchcock and Stephen King in equal measure.
7732	5	a	Injecting a devil-may-care attitude into a franchise-focused blockbuster only gets you so far. When all is said and done, this wasp's got no sting.
7733	5	a	The film is blatantly aimed at the Oscar committee - anyone else may well find it slightly dull.
7734	6	a	Aunque tiene algunas secuencias y momentos bien logrados, el resultado final es muy disparejo
7735	0	a	It's easy to dismiss The Artist as a simple love letter to the silent-film era, but there is a lot more at work here than just an attention-getting gimmick.
7736	4	a	"Like an acquaintance couple's baby pictures, ""Friends With Kids"" induces coos but isn't as cute as they think."
7737	1	a	Cameron and crew have once again spectacularly captured the awesome story.
7738	4	a	A quirky, funny but moving story with terrific performances all around.
7739	3	a	Pooh's Heffalump Movie is just the thing for really little kids and their parents.
7740	9	a	Even the sound effects get tiring: How many times can you hear swords being clanged, yanked from the Earth or sinking squishily into quivering flesh without getting bored?
7741	7	a	...it does have one redeeming attribute: brevity.
7742	6	a	Nearly three hours, and the story has progressed only slightly. Nothing is short and sweet here, not even the identities. It's always Thorin, son of Theraflu, son of Thong, etc.
7743	6	a	Foxx is definitely putting in the effort; The Soloist, however, is settling for something much less.
7744	5	a	Bright Days Ahead means to be a casual, charming movie about a woman taking charge of her life, but its lightness gets unbearable; the film is so featherweight that it eventually blows away. 
7745	4	a	Although there are moments in the film when his visual style threatens to overwhelm the story, Scott keeps the stylistic flourishes to a minimum.
7746	3	a	Black Snake Moan is a trip to that unfamiliar territory well worth tagging along on.
7747	3	a	If this had been released on Thanksgiving Day or Christmas Day, it wouldn't have been lost in the shuffle.
7748	5	a	The most severe example of self-indulgent, out-of-touch filmmaking in recent memory.
7749	5	a	goes about relating sincerely odd characters in a resoundingly ordinary way
7750	3	a	Fincher fires on all cylinders to save this story from itself, exhibiting the propulsive energy of Fight Club and the storytelling mastery of Zodiac and The Social Network.
7751	0	a	Most powerfully, [Berg] also films a number of O'Grady's victims as they recount their trauma and, in some cases, loss of faith.
7752	2	a	The crazy scenario provides an opportunity for Simon Pegg, Nick Frost and the rest of the cast to showcase their comedic talents.
7753	6	a	The climactic scenes are a little too aggressively grandiose, the triumphant music a fraction of a decibel too loud.
7754	6	a	The film is not stingy with effects, and its hermetic atmosphere is effectively realized, but leaves the film so spare of air that combustion never leads to conflagration.
7755	5	a	None of the plan details so essential to a tense heist drama are given to us; the gang's individual characterisations get lost, and the movie gets boringly marooned in a Reservoir Dogsish abandoned stockyard. Disappointing.
7756	2	a	Action movie fans will love Gladiator for its intensity. Those looking for something more intelligent will find moments of satisfaction here, but will wish it had more of a theme than 'revenge is sweet.'
7757	9	a	An embarrassment, a film so humiliating to everyone involved, it is shocking that protesters haven't come out of the woodwork to scream bloody murder.
7758	6	a	This is, in short, a mystery story that has very little actual mystery.
7759	1	a	A first-class pop entertainment packed to the brim with astounding effects and near-non-stop action and suspense.
7760	5	a	If your idea of fun is an hour and a half surrounded by screaming, whining, vomiting children, then this may be your movie.
7761	4	a	The whole thing feels booby-trapped. Almost every single expectation is greeted with a smile and a squeeze of gunfire as a rim shot.
7762	9	a	Tim and Eric are more tolerable in small doses. When they try to stretch their shenanigans to a feature-length format, the results are even more nonsensical-and even more antagonistic.
7763	4	a	The Full Monty carries beneath its feelgood trajectory an exquisite air of gallows humour mixed with a dash of melancholy and a wee sprinkling of empathetic leftist politics.
7764	4	a	It isn't bulletproof by a long shot, but director Nimrod Antal's grungy gang-of-thieves pic is tough and, for this genre, surprisingly ethical.
7765	3	a	Wilmot is so thoroughly committed to being so awful that his debauchery has a kind of purity about it.
7766	9	a	For a film to render [Murray's] presence grating is a rare thing indeed, but that's what ends up happening here...
7767	7	a	Try as it might to hold our attention, it disappoints at every turn, ending in a whimper rather than a bang.
7768	6	a	Disappointment comes from the sense that the picture started off with the promise of being something different, maybe even something scathing, but then settles for something rather routine.
7769	0	a	Great new classic western.
7770	5	a	With only one member of its love triangle really delivering, this packs less of an emotional punch than it ought. And who'd be a courtier, eh?
7771	5	a	...hurt by Parker and Stone's reliance on speechifying and heavy-handed diatribes...
7772	8	a	It's about as useless as the MTV that created it, full of shiny objects and pretty people and almost entirely devoid of merit.
7773	4	a	If you're looking for a tight script, interesting three-dimensional characters and something new with this movie, you will be disappointed.
7774	4	a	This movie gives families a good opportunity to talk about what makes us human.
7775	3	a	As this existential odyssey draws to a close, it sews itself up with the aplomb that only a confident, controlled filmmaker can marshal.
7776	4	a	Ironically enough, Chamber of Secrets has more of a narrative arc, but consequently lacks much urgency. It does retain the wonderment that made the first film fun.
7777	3	a	With his latest directorial effort, Soderbergh has made a film that not only constantly pokes fun at its own characters and their lives, but finds a way to imbue each of them with a soul and heart along the way.
7778	3	a	Unlikely and engaging, this quirky, off-beat romantic dramedy is a cheerfully enjoyable crowd-pleaser.
7779	2	a	It's an unusual recipe for a PG-rated kids' flick, but it works.
7780	5	a	Cusack does a good impression of an estate agent having a midlife crisis, while Brody adds to his gallery of eye-rollingly awful performances by going full Tony Montana.
7781	5	a	If you are a regular moviegoer who can't get enough of the daytime soaps, look no further than Mother and Child. It has enough soapy story lines to fill out at least three daytime series for a month.
7782	4	a	For a sports flick, this is unique and holds your attention for the most part.
7783	2	a	Even some of the film's strongest proponents are positioning the film as a good-for-you, syllabus-ready obligation. That's an affront to the intelligence, cinematic flexibility and emotional satisfaction of this rousing film.
7784	3	a	For such a sweet-natured, candy-colored, family-friendly animated adventure, Ralph Breaks the Internet serves up quite the mega-helping of meta material.
7785	3	a	Muriel's Wedding isn't a perfect comedy, tragedy, or drama, but it contains enough original elements of each to make it worth a look.
7786	3	a	Quirky sci-fi comedy wears its heart on its sleeve as it plays tricks with time.
7787	7	a	An action film that doesn't excite and a comedy you never laugh at.
7788	3	a	I don't know how long Owen Wilson can continue to coast on his dippy charm, but as long as his coasting elevates high-concept comedies such as You, Me and Dupree, it's fine by me.
7789	4	a	Ridley Scott plays the con game with more style than story, mostly thanks to Nicolas Cage's tic-riddled, jumpy lead performance.
7790	6	a	For every genuine emotion that McDonagh evokes, he can't resist undercutting it by showing off.
7791	2	a	This is a film with gay/lesbian sensibilities that can play well with a crossover more mainstream crowd
7792	4	a	There are enough laughs, winning performances, attractive people and appealing romance to make Hitch an amusing option for the Valentine season.
7793	6	a	The passage from contention to excess turns a worthy film into a film worthy of the Hallmark Channel. [Full Review in Spanish] 
7794	7	a	A ponderous melodrama.
7795	0	a	Spielberg can never top this. Period.
7796	2	a	It's about as lightweight as a cars-and-crime action movie should be.
7797	3	a	It's Premium Bond.
7798	5	a	There's no rule that videogame movies have to be idiotic. And there's no rule that action-horror flicks need be dumb.
7799	3	a	This delightful piece of whimsy uses its simple premise effectively to gain and keep our attention and to remind us simply that, while this world appears ordinary, it is still unbounded by reality.
7800	2	a	All-in-all, the film comes across as a family entertainer - something which the adults can enjoy with their kids -- and has all the hallmarks of the beginning of a profitable franchise for Amblin.
7801	5	a	The ultimate contradiction ... is that a film about the Prince of Peace is violent enough to earn an R rating.
7802	4	a	I caught myself feeling surprised that such a banal movie could actually be off-the-cuff and entertaining.
7803	3	a	In this cookie cutter movie world, it's nice to see the occasional move that doesn't quite fit into a specific genre or can't easily be classified.
7804	3	a	...a good film with some great moments and two excellent lead performances...
7805	4	a	See-saws between straight superhero movie and parody, with layers of soap-opera fudge in between. A lot of solid scenes - but Hancock lacks the power of super-coherence.
7806	3	a	Neeson's contained, steely performance lifts this truncated tale of Watergate. 
7807	0	a	...charged with some of the same inchoate longing of Hiroshima, Mon Amour and employs some of the same guerilla production tactics of Godard's Breathless
7808	3	a	Stiller's never been better as an actor.
7809	0	a	Unfettered by irony, inspiring the kind of spontaneous emotional response we yearn for at the multiplex, [it] immerses us in joyful illusion, a world of movies within movies.
7810	6	a	The funniest joke is the one nobody talks about: the gender confusion of male cows with udders.
7811	3	a	Terrific story of young ballet dancer has strong language.
7812	9	a	Phil Alden Robinson's overheated dramedy feels disconnected from reality in every emotional way, but at least he captures the impotent fury that hits everyone stuck in the wrong lane on Flatbush Ave.
7813	3	a	Deliver Us From Evil is an explosive documentary about a depravity so gross, it leaves you appalled and infuriated that the men who enabled it have never been called to account.
7814	2	a	There is a sentimental aspect to the concluding stages of the film: it's not as broad or astringent as Payne can be. But there's also something intriguingly dreamlike about its tone.
7815	5	a	Disclosure, ostensibly about reverse sexual harassment, is really just a platform for Moore's true lack of acting ability to come through better than ever.
7816	3	a	Deliciously dark, superbly written thriller-slash-twisted love story from Pedro Almodovar that explores some fascinating ideas about obsession and revenge, and features a terrific performance from Antonio Banderas.
7817	3	a	This is a genre entry that knows exactly what it is and has a lot of fun being it. It pushes most of the right buttons, assumes its audience has a brain and doesn't telegraph its punches right from the very start.
7818	4	a	If this Woodstock comes off as Edenic... don't assume the movie's advertising the real thing. Think of it as Ang Lee taking a vacation from too much reality.
7819	2	a	Ties each of its loose ends into a neat little bow.
7820	10	a	"If you hear the phrase ""Italian caveman epic"" and your heart doesn't sing at least a little bit, then I pity your sad and joyless existence."
7821	3	a	Even though the mix contains lumps, Cat's Eye is the best screen adaptation of any King work since Brian De Palma's Carrie.
7822	3	a	Not enough can be said about Clarke... who slides seamlessly into the countenance of Teddy Kennedy, from the cagey arrogance and compassionate, somber reflectiveness to the vacant eyes of a man coming to terms with his own lethal folly.
7823	1	a	House of Flying Daggers pierces the mind's eye with its crazy beautiful images, then rends the heart.
7824	0	a	Run to Chicken Run. This clay-animation comedy is the most entertaining animal story since Babe.
7825	0	a	Duh.
7826	3	a	For a story that could so easily have got it wrong, A Royal Night Out seems to hit the right notes time and again. Bright, breezy and charming to the last, there's not an ounce of cynicism here.
7827	3	a	Cheadle, an always-dynamic actor, is compelling as he delivers Greene's no-bull radio talks and stand-up comedy routines.
7828	3	a	One of the few con jobs since The Grifters that cheats its characters, not its audience.
7829	4	a	The movie is good for its minimal escapism, but little more.
7830	0	a	A must-see not only for fans of Shakur's music but for anyone who appreciates a well-told life story.
7831	5	a	If Levinson were trying to capture the sentiment of his earlier film Good Morning, Vietnam, which successfully mixed comedy and war, Rock the Kasbah completely misses the mark.
7832	5	a	Passable if profane, Hancock chugs along right up to that when this comic superhero engine goes off the tracks, and pretty much off a cliff.
7833	4	a	Though the film is spongy and drenched in sweetness, Bruce Beresford's direction is steady and well oiled.
7834	4	a	It is a lush, blushingly romantic portrait of Asian culture as seen through a Western lens.
7835	2	a	If you've seen the trailer, you've seen the movie.
7836	5	a	Are excitable eight-year-olds - this movie's intellectual target audience - really going to wait another ten years before they can watch it legally?
7837	3	a	All questions of taste and plausibility aside, The Dressmaker is a hoot and a healthy shock to the system. Australian cinema may never be quite the same again.
7838	3	a	Writer and actress tilt between insecurity and bravado, employing dry, observational humour tinged with occasional sentimental flashes only outwardly out of character.
7839	9	a	A limp sequel seemingly devoid of any wit or invention.
7840	4	a	The film makes an effort to put a positive spin on familiar urban problems, while the action and the generally adept performances are varied enough to maintain interest.
7841	4	a	Linklater is very aware that his film doesn't have a linear narrative and the movie is structured with that knowledge, as well as for a variety in tone and theme. 
7842	5	a	When 'fans' respond to an unabashedly silly title like Snakes on a Plane and start riffing on it, how seriously do they mean for their suggestions to be taken?
7843	3	a	It might even get a best screenplay nomination come Oscar time next year.
7844	1	a	It's the way that Koreeda handles such quotidian details and detours of this quartet that makes all the difference. 
7845	0	a	The Passion of the Christ is a tremendous FILM and if you look at it through those eyes you may believe that too. 
7846	4	a	Lacks action.
7847	6	a	[B]y the time Country Strong ends, it has largely defeated the feel-good buzz from its subplots involving puppy love and charity.
7848	6	a	The Savages is a labored labor of love about an estranged brother and sister, who have to deal with a frail and fractious father.
7849	4	a	It is decaffeinated to the point of paralysis, which is the opposite reaction the stimulants in question typically produce.
7850	2	a	It takes awhile to get going but, still, it's rather sweet.
7851	4	a	The Hollywood adaptation admirably avoids the urge to sanitize the material -- this isn't Mighty Ducks in the Hood.
7852	3	a	I haven't laughed myself to tears in a while, but this movie made it happen... doesn't quite hold itself together all the way through, otherwise it might've been a slam dunk.
7853	0	a	Even if you haven't been in this exact situation, if you ever did, this Judd Apatow fella would totally know what it's like.
7854	3	a	Selma is a rousing political drama, made with enough verve and passion never merely to seem didactic. Its near complete absence from this year's Oscar nominations is baffling and suggests a double standard.
7855	5	a	The House with a Clock in Its Walls never quite grasps what made its inspirations tick.
7856	3	a	Young Colombian director Guerra's visionary and wildly ambitious film seems like a movie from another era. 
7857	6	a	Although Jamie Foxx's performance in 'The Soloist' is worth the ticket price, the film fails to leave audiences with a satisfying ending.
7858	9	a	I know I'm in the minority about Bill Murray's talent. He's just not funny and this is the least funny work he's done in a career full of not funny movies. 
7859	4	a	Both movies lack the real discomfort and awkwardness that comes with meeting future in-laws.
7860	3	a	Here's a romantic comedy in which the stars actually have some believable chemistry.
7861	9	a	a lot of money, a lot of time, and a lot of pyrotechnics to deliver a tiny little fizzle of a flick.
7862	3	a	[Star, Abbie] Cornish shines.
7863	3	a	Restricted as an up-and-coming filmmaker, Aronofsky didn't conform to convention and instead delivered his art full throttle...
7864	0	a	Spielberg was wise to not rely entirely on computer images, rather blending the new technology with old-fashioned practical designs and the result is a film that looks far better than any modern tentpole blockbuster.
7865	3	a	As much a modern existential Western as a science-fiction drama in the manner of 'Mad Max.'
7866	6	a	Hokum with a big-budget gloss, it's a simple, formulaic nail-biter.
7867	4	a	A one-joke sci-fi comedy.
7868	0	a	Ideal Sunday afternoon fare.
7869	3	a	Fantastically funny, weird film has violence, alcohol, more.
7870	6	a	never really amazing enough to separate it from the rest of the herd of great animation that we've seen this summer.
7871	5	a	The movie's just such a pain in the ass.
7872	1	a	A gripping, powerful motion picture -- arguably the most forceful depiction of Jesus' death ever to be committed to film.
7873	4	a	Letters From Juliet is far from a great movie. But if you're female or -- like me -- a man with a taste for romance and a fairer deal for our senior citizens, this is one of the year's guiltiest pleasures.
7874	3	a	Here's a film that presents its subject as she was, without any attempt to soften her, to lionize her, or ... to turn her into someone she was not.
7875	4	a	Boseman is the highlight, of course, and Taylor is smart to keep his leading man front-and-center in every, single scene. 
7876	4	a	What Black's movie really has going for it is pace. It starts with a crash, followed swiftly by a bang and vast swathes of wallop. The relentlessness doesn't allow you any time to catch a yawn, but it's also not too conducive to tension or suspense.
7877	4	a	Unintentionally hilarious. This thing is funnier than most of the comedies I have seen.
7878	6	a	The second half of Man of the Year bears practically no relation to the irreverent comedy the movie's trailer sells you -- much like a politician who doesn't keep any of the promises that lured you to vote for him.
7879	6	a	Very playful with the complex and ridiculous series of events and actions that will lead to each character's death, which gives the audience some giggles
7880	1	a	Fierce, funny and finally devastating.
7881	6	a	Does it work? Yes, mostly because of Diesel and Leslie, who clearly love this kind of loony fun.
7882	9	a	A True Hollywood Story so cheeky and thin it makes My Week with Marilyn seem substantial.
7883	6	a	saddled with side stories that are meant to put specific faces on the issues of the time, but feel meandering and unfocused
7884	4	a	Colourful, inventive, fast-moving fantasy adventure that kids will love and adults will be grateful for.
7885	6	a	Man of the Year has to be one of the most frustrating dropped balls in recent multiplex memory.
7886	3	a	The Imitation Game is an astounding story, both for its marvel and its misery.
7887	6	a	Loud, obnoxious, and pleasant-enough entertainment, but hardly the soaring tale of one man's struggle that it was so clearly envisioned to be.
7888	3	a	Another masterful benchmark in Clint Eastwood's illustrious career.
7889	4	a	Breakin' All the Rules doesn't break any rules at all. It's just a by-the-numbers romantic comedy.
7890	2	a	It's a shame that The Great New Wonderful occasionally strains as it reaches all around New York, searching for touched lives and subtext; it's an overachiever already.
7891	3	a	A deadpan delight...a graceful, quietly humorous tribute to the sort of fringe-dwellers rarely seen in mainstream movies, let alone treated with such affection and respect.
7892	5	a	Blanks ... appears to be carving himself a career making slasher movies for a new generation; unfortunately, he's in no way improving on the originals.
7893	7	a	It's often hard to tell what's going on -- where, when, and why.
7894	3	a	"The humor is fast and furious, especially the ingrained hatred between fans of ""Star Wars"" and ""Star Trek."
7895	3	a	Fassbender and Vikander explore their characters' various thorny moral quandaries and shifting states of mind in breath-catching depth, drilling down through the plot's melodramatic crust to the swirling ethical magma underneath.
7896	6	a	The movie suggests that, like the waters of the great oceans that cover the Earth, all things are connected-past, present and future; grief and happiness; war and peace; life and death.
7897	0	a	The story, characters, music, and look of the film come together to form one complete, unified work with a consistent tone and feeling.
7898	0	a	Bill's performance is just fantastic - filled with a confident vulnerability that only he is capable of.
7899	4	a	With more nuance, this could have been a great film. As it is, it's merely a good one, but glittering with great performances.
7900	3	a	Runs a little long, but it will warm your heart.
7901	6	a	Apparently the Disney folks don't even bother with A.A. Milne anymore. They just borrow his characters and do with them what they will -- which mostly means cramming toy stores with plush Poohs, Piglets and Eeyores.
7902	0	a	Mann's last western is a powerful film.
7903	8	a	If this film makes money, and it probably will, there may never be a final Final Destination. And that is the most disturbing thing about this movie.
7904	3	a	If you want to dwell on details, you won't like this film, but if you just sit back and relax and try not to be crabby, it is a lot of fun.
7905	5	a	Basic Instinct is a reminder of the difference between exhilaration and exhaustion, between tension and hysteria, between eroticism and exhibitionism. The line may be fine, but it is real enough to separate the great thrillers from the also-rans.
7906	3	a	We watch these young people as they experiment, grow and learn, and when the movie finally ends after two hours, we're sorry to leave them behind.
7907	2	a	A shrewd thriller that's both smarter and funnier than you'd expect.
7908	4	a	The animation is fine, the plot accessible enough for youngsters and it clocks in at a snappy hour and a half.
7909	5	a	"I Origins"" will divide audiences without multiplying them."
7910	4	a	'The Prestige' is one of those weird movies that plays better in memory than it does on the screen.
7911	6	a	Nonsensical plotting, equally silly character interaction and groan-inducing dialogue.
7912	3	a	... American Hustle is like a passionate, booze-soaked conversation at a party: fun while it last, but foggy the next morning.
7913	6	a	Does the usual Hollywood bit of setting up the gags way in advance so that even a coma patient can spot them.
7914	1	a	A romantic drama of lovely, modest, and all too rare understatement.
7915	6	a	While the artwork in the film is very good, the story is curiously cool and emotionally uninvolving.
7916	4	a	Nicely written and featuring a great soundtrack, this is an unashamedly feel-good drama with terrific performances from a superb cast.
7917	6	a	There is an extremely supportive and welcoming market for an actress like this in the right romantic comedy. Must Love Dogs is half that movie; witty, rueful, true and sweet. The other half is so conventionally dumb, it hurts.
7918	3	a	While Cumberbatch will get all the accolades, his character's younger self is inhabited by actor Alex Lawther, whose performance matches and complements the lead marvelously.
7919	0	a	retains elements of surrealism while remaining one of the more accessible and playful of his films.
7920	3	a	"There's an ache of regret that sets ""Albert Nobbs'' apart. Everyone here yearns for what they can't get."
7921	3	a	Farhan Akhtar's performance here puts his still-young acting career on equal weight with his justly celebrated one as a writer, director, and producer.
7922	3	a	Zoo is contrived but sweet.
7923	9	a	A lousy excuse for a big-budget action film. 
7924	5	a	Choppy, point-of-view twisting thriller that never rises above its gimmickry.
7925	1	a	Once in a while, the massive desert that is Modern American Comedy yields an oasis so sweet it simply demands to be appreciated.
7926	1	a	Possibly Francis McDormand's best performance leads the way for a spectacular cast and crew to tell a stirring story of grief and redemption.
7927	4	a	The final half hour or so is an exhilarating action sequence beautifully done, ending in a rather excellent sausage party indeed.
7928	3	a	There's plenty of exciting action to keep little ones amused and enough clever and funny touches to make sure adults aren't bored either.
7929	0	a	"Even with a freewheeling style, ""Hustle"" is never aimless. All that flash, sass and canny sense for detail hit the jackpot ..."
7930	5	a	The only thing I rooted for in Failure To Launch was for Matthew McConaughey and Sarah Jessica Parker -- the two leads -- to find better movies.
7931	5	a	Murphy's film version of the story is relentlessly superficial, a slick, empty travelogue propped up only by Roberts' natural charisma.
7932	7	a	I did not laugh once during this entire picture.
7933	1	a	This coming-of-age love story is all texture, tone and nuance...Luca Guadagnino has made a lovely cinematic feather. And it floats down beautifully, riding a soft breeze of melancholy and grace.
7934	3	a	The first Trainspotting was about heroin. The second is about another dangerously addictive drug: Nostalgia.
7935	1	a	With kinetic ferocity the two proceed to rip one another to shreds, and within the first ten minutes it becomes more than apparent the only thing hitting an iceberg here will be these two's marriage.
7936	4	a	While it also suffers from a slow start and stretched premise, the charm of its stars getting wasted and debunking an intergalactic conspiracy goes a long way.
7937	9	a	If DeLillo talks a lot, that's his job: he's a writer. When Cronenberg movies talk - and the density of dialogue here has no mercy - they die sitting up, like a teacher at his desk.
7938	0	a	A passionate, full-blooded film.
7939	3	a	Inventive, funny and fast-paced, it's the rare example of a sequel that improves upon the original. 
7940	2	a	Probably the best possible movie version of The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo.
7941	4	a	Despite its cast, it's a bit thin on the acting, but like all of del Toro's films, it has a visual sensibility that's truly the star of the show.
7942	5	a	Vantage Point's summed up by its name; from some angles, it looks like an above-average studio thriller, but from others it falls out of sight fast.
7943	3	a	The sharp wit, soft-focus cinematography and slow-motion lyricism lift it into the realm of this summer's nicest surprises.
7944	3	a	It all comes off this summer.
7945	5	a	Everyone loves Bill Murray, right? So we can all agree the guy deserves better than Rock The Kasbah.
7946	4	a	Far from a perfect film, but it is a lot of fun. In the tradition of old-fashioned thrillers, the movie has some nice twists and turns in the plot. 
7947	3	a	We discover what made the phone app angry birds incandescent with rage in The Angry Birds Movie, repurposed for children in this cheerfully ironic adaptation.
7948	2	a	...stands up with the best of the modern B monster movies.
7949	4	a	If nothing else, [Coppola] has proven that she can keep up with the other members of her famous clan.
7950	3	a	Enjoyable, well written relationship comedy making some astute observations and providing terrific performances from a superb cast, though the initially promisingly offbeat script ultimately lacks the courage to kick against convention.
7951	5	a	Chummy caper comedy, mainly for Rat Pack fanciers.
7952	4	a	Obviously heartfelt and unusually sharp-sighted, Friends With Kids is good enough that you wish it were better. 
7953	3	a	On the flip side, both Damon and Freeman deliver exemplary performances, and even if the accents aren't perfect the way they dig deep inside their respective characters certainly is.
7954	6	a	'Overall, what more can you say about this two-bit meandering and empty-headed carousing crime comedy? Bottom line: everyone connected with this project ought to be handcuffed to the door handle of a speedy out-of-control police cruiser.'
7955	6	a	Who pays the price for Skyfall? Bond fans do, of course. But so does Daniel Craig. He's not going to be around forever - not in this shape, anyway.
7956	4	a	Yes, it was bad. But I laughed.
7957	4	a	There are insights into old age, pearls of wisdom and gags galore, all wrapped up in a coating that's more akin to a bitter lemon than sugar.
7958	9	a	So preoccupied with score-settling, it is frankly rather embarrassing, like that obnoxious relative at Thanksgiving dinner who insists on revisiting each and every perceived slight.
7959	0	a	Sweet and sad at the same time it is sardonic and funny.
7960	4	a	A good movie, although it's sometimes too antiseptic for what a Western should be. There's some great shoot-out scenes.
7961	1	a	Made by intelligent people for intelligent people.
7962	3	a	...a combination of the old and the new, the predictable and the completely unexpected.
7963	2	a	The good news is that this Fantastic Four film manages to capture a lot of what made the comics appealing. The bad news is that the final product isn't quite as good as it could have been.
7964	3	a	Very amusing trifle from when Demme still had a personality
7965	2	a	Exceptionally thoughtful, not only in terms of consumerism, but when considering the value of compassion as well. Worth your hard earned money, no strings attached.
7966	1	a	Woody Allen's comedy Midnight in Paris is a superior late-period work precisely because it appears that age and wisdom have finally allowed him to discover that his romantic streak can acknowledge his realist/cynical side without succumbing to it.
7967	6	a	The film is framed so deliberately as a prelude to more exciting times to come in its sequels that it renders the ending oddly anti-climactic.
7968	0	a	'The Artist' is a masterpiece.
7969	4	a	Winslet and Davis are both so good, bringing genuine poignancy to the evolving mother-daughter relationship, that I found myself sucked into their strange world ...
7970	2	a	A charming and sophisticated comedy.
7971	6	a	The title suggests there are no easy answers. So why does everything feel so tidy?
7972	3	a	Surprisingly gritty. Tina Fey's best big-screen work.
7973	3	a	The Soloist has its imperfections, but its ambition trumps them.
7974	3	a	This amalgamation of inspirational themes cuts a new notch on Eastwood's well-used viewfinder.
7975	3	a	Cool, clever and complex, Altman succeeds in bringing out the best from a highly talented cast.
7976	0	a	Utterly engaging, a transporting bit of cinema that immerses viewers -- uncomfortably at times -- in a riveting detective story.
7977	4	a	Could have been tightened up and shortened to be a much stronger film, and it's surprisingly unsatisfying as a whole.
7978	1	a	"As in ""Man on Wire,"" Marsh shows smooth craft and a sharp eye, and ""Project Nim"" is at once astounding and infuriating."
7979	3	a	In a riveting debut performance, Nicole Beharie captures your heart and soul in a compelling, moving tale that inspires hope to many youths today.
7980	4	a	A robust screen adaptation of Doctorow's novel about class warfare, social change, and the gap between the rich and the poor
7981	3	a	In Paranoid Park, not much actually happens and yet one teenager's mind is filled with far more than enough to ponder for a long time.
7982	1	a	What's not to like about The Artist? And then again, what is there, exactly, to love about it?
7983	9	a	It is a staggeringly awful road movie, not much enlivened by the presence of Tom Waits as a wizened participant.
7984	4	a	Disney's first theatrical sequel in decades, and a surprisingly strong case for keeping those sequels quick, cheap, and straight-to-video. 
7985	7	a	You can laugh at the dumb jokes but if you try and defend this as a good movie then that's where you lose us.
7986	9	a	A grievously ill-advised motion picture on every level ...
7987	3	a	Contains some truly iconic moments, but too much of it, i.e. any scene without Orlock, is less than stellar.
7988	4	a	Better character-connection would inject this well photographed episodic journey around the island with a higher level of dramatic justification.
7989	0	a	A cinematic masterpiece, this feature may be small in scope but it's momentous in its ability to capture how complex and powerful the civil rights movement was.
7990	3	a	A powerfully written, well-acted movie that tackles an unusual and compelling subject.
7991	3	a	First-rate performances and an irresistibly exciting and moving story help this drama rise above the traditional biopic.
7992	8	a	Its appeal lies in its innate ability of tapping into that sense of joy that lies within us all. It is irresistibly charming. It is unmissable.
7993	3	a	Miles Teller is a knockout in this surprising boxing film that takes a stunning turn to be the most remarkable comeback story I can recall.
7994	4	a	If there's nothing else to be gained from Lee's latest, at least it confirms his amazing instinct for finding talent.
7995	2	a	A down and dirty action adventure, and the best escapist entertainment around. Check your brain at the door for non-stop rowdy, riotous and raucous fun. 
7996	0	a	By now everyone knows Frank Capra's holiday classic and the tears it so effortlessly conjures up year after year -- but it's easy to forget how truly vicious the film is, and how brilliantly James Stewart rises to the challenge.
7997	5	a	There's nothing in Larry Crowne that Dan Harmon's Community doesn't do faster, funnier and with far more intelligence every Thursday night.
7998	4	a	It's quite an amusing movie.
7999	3	a	A strong piece of mass market filmmaking.
8000	5	a	The acting is amazing but the story is one long drive to despair
8001	5	a	The audience laughed more because they wanted to find it funny than because they actually did.
8002	2	a	Downey's performance is always enthralling, fascinating, and utterly present. But the inconsistency of the rest of the film makes him more of a soloist than intended.
8003	2	a	The diverting -- if derivative -- crime drama, directed by Jackie Earle Haley, comes laced with equal parts comedy and lurid violence, a la Quentin Tarantino.
8004	3	a	... a harrowing character study.
8005	6	a	"Black Nativity"" deepens into a rich experience once the scene shifts to the inside of a church, but it's a long time getting there."
8006	6	a	The banal voice-over narration by Harry Connick Jr., combined with the gooey score and feckless direction adds up to a sterilization of American life that makes Norman Rockwell look like Diane Arbus.
8007	4	a	A moderately entertaining cautionary tale.
8008	0	a	A movie that is so original, so funny, so alive with drama, intrigue, mystery and colors that you want to see it again and again.
8009	6	a	a limp attempt to stage a story around the most historic concert ever and then treat the concert as a background echo to the predictable melodrama on center stage.
8010	1	a	The real strength of Menashe lies with its ability to be a fly on the wall of a fragile existence that can take any number of unexpected turns.
8011	2	a	A quirky, genial crowd-pleaser that probably cost less than the catering bill for one of the franchise mega-productions but delivers a lot more fun than most of them.
8012	2	a	A delightfully strange, if somewhat inconsistent, animated western.
8013	9	a	A great-looking but stupefyingly incoherent supernatural thriller,
8014	3	a	Hello, My Name Is Doris is a delightful slice of quirky romanticism, cooked up in a Williamsburg bakery that only uses locally sourced, holistically blessed ingredients.
8015	3	a	A gritty, haunting voyeur's peek into the human condition.
8016	0	a	One of the warmest and funniest films of the year.
8017	5	a	The movie is intended as an effervescent fizz; instead, it's a fizzle. What should have been a knockout punch turns out to be more of a gentle poke in the ribs.
8018	3	a	Bandslam is hardly the definition of a great movie, but it is pleasant and bright and doesn't insult its audience's intelligence. And that's as rare and welcome as a well-crafted three-minute pop song.
8019	3	a	Big laughs, big heart, big teenage moments. Really understands high school and being young.
8020	5	a	Were it not for its title, this plodding, tiresome mess would have never seen the light of day.
8021	3	a	Shocking and effective but doesn't quite live up to all the hype.
8022	1	a	We knew Spielberg had action chops, but didn't know he had this in him. This anti-E.T. is so rigorously realized it makes Independence Day look like Finding Neverland.
8023	3	a	A solidly crafted, creepily suspenseful thriller.
8024	2	a	Charming, offbeat serio comedy about the relationship between a macho and a transsexual
8025	4	a	An entertaining thriller, but a miscalculated biopic.
8026	6	a	Like Coogan's reporter, you'll want to wrap your arms around Judi Dench's Philomena and take her home. You can't, of course - but Philomena will follow you there anyway.
8027	6	a	The movie charts the rise and fall of the label without ever centering on any characters or relationships; it's history without personality.
8028	3	a	This time out, [Sade] is an unsettlingly familiar figure -- in turns loyal and deceitful, responsible and reckless, idealistically selfless and coldly self-interested.
8029	5	a	There's so much going on here -- and so much of it is indifferently staged, photographed and acted ... -- that the film quickly loses focus.
8030	4	a	It has moments of effectiveness, some of the performances are moving, and the power-producer couple of Tracey E. Edmonds and Kenneth 'Babyface' Edmonds obviously have only the best of community-minded, non-exploitative intentions.
8031	3	a	Knocked Up really comes alive when it has something to say about the thorny responsibilities -- and unexpected blessings -- of adult relationships.
8032	0	a	This is a complex, grown up thriller that's rich in its gritty detail and nearly flawless in its stuntwork.
8033	4	a	This video-game-to-celluloid adaptation has a clammy, nightmarish glaze and tightly coiled sense of tension.
8034	4	a	Finally, The Rock has come back to the action genre.
8035	7	a	A muddled film full of one-dimensional characters and insultingly strident politics.
8036	0	a	I can't believe I am saying this, but I think Serenity could be the new Star Wars.
8037	3	a	Conventional movies, even independent ones, tend to get histrionic and judgmental about such drug-related setbacks. But Granik's film, though hardly a clinical case study, keeps a measured distance from the heavy-handed or simplistic.
8038	2	a	The Atomic Cafe captures the Atomic Age and the resulting Cold War better than any documentary
8039	3	a	Talulah Riley is simply sensational and newcomer Gemma Arterton pulls off a brilliant debut as sexy head girl Kelly.
8040	6	a	Another British writer is given the worthy cinematic treatment, complete with an American actress in the title role and sentiment that overwhelms what should be a gritty story.
8041	4	a	Cornball classic weeper is at least true to its book basis.
8042	1	a	"...mysterious and powerful. Pialat, an atheist, has made a deeply spiritual film in the canon of Dreyer and Bresson, Bruno Dumont's ""Hors Satan"" surely influenced by it."
8043	1	a	Even when it's corny and a wee bit manipulative and you know that is exactly what it's doing, you sort of don't mind.
8044	1	a	The most romantic movie of the year.
8045	4	a	As it is, the movie is a roller coaster ride for those who prefer not to think once the theater lights have dimmed.
8046	9	a	Unfortunately an illuminating bio-pic of one of cinema's most enduring and celebrated figures is not what's been delivered.
8047	6	a	Against The Ropes is the latest sucker punch that arrives in the arena of unbearable boxing sagas complete with built-in sporting cliches and forged bravado
8048	1	a	[F]antastic, a whiz-bang follow-up that far surpasses the original as it breathlessly zigs and zags all over the globe.
8049	5	a	... a very boring children's movie... [Full review in Spanish]
8050	5	a	A strange hodgepodge of genres and tones, right down to a particularly off-putting mid-section montage that serves as a classic move-the-story-along device.
8051	5	a	This anemic vampire tale boasts an interesting premise but suffers from lethargic pacing and an overdose of splatter special effects.
8052	2	a	Jenkins fans looking for the irreverent humor of Slums need not apply.
8053	0	a	Brad Bird has crafted a sleek and original homage to the derring-do of our most cherished superheroes.
8054	4	a	What starts out as slight and fairly obvious turns into a frequently colorful horror tale.
8055	3	a	You might not have a clue what is going on; but enter into its freewheeling spirit and [the] film turns out to be unexpectedly captivating, with a touching undertow of melancholy detectable beneath the off-kilter humour and bizarre plotting.
8056	4	a	Despite my reservations, Three Billboards Outside of Ebbing, Missouri is certainly memorably clever and boldly conceived. And any film that allows McDormand to strut her to stuff to this degree can't be all bad.
8057	4	a	It's far from a great movie - an overwritten, underplotted vanity project that's a distant echo of what director Lawrence Kasdan could do in his prime. But it has Diane Keaton, and that's enough.
8058	9	a	Simply put, this is one of the most ill-advised biopics to grace screens in years.
8059	3	a	This may be a minor movie, but it displays the hallmarks of a major talent.
8060	4	a	The spirit of Marie Colvin is felt within the film, and Pike's embodiment of this hero is something we should all be proud to stand with in a climate where the soul of our humanity is deeply troubled.
8061	9	a	Two screen superstars can't pump any authentic life into this shallow drama.
8062	4	a	The best film since Pulp Fiction in which there are no really good guys.
8063	4	a	Admittedly, mediocre Sayles is still watchable, but, relative to expectations, Casa de los Babys is a disappointment of significant proportions.
8064	4	a	Comes decorated with likeable performances, noble intentions and folksy sentiments.
8065	5	a	Blame Marc Lawrence for most of the film's flaws.
8066	6	a	If you enjoyed any of the previous Scary Movies this one will likely appeal to you. The humor is broad, but much of it hits.
8067	1	a	Deals with themes Eastwood has often explored before, but never so delicately or with as much sad wisdom: The way in which our past haunts our present, the lasting repercussions of violence and the cruel inexorability of fate.
8068	4	a	This poignant true story is worthwhile but oddly unsatisfying.
8069	5	a	A middling, so-so thriller.
8070	5	a	The real sinful hex at large that some unsuspecting moviegoers will ultimately suffer is succumbing to the laughable supernatural spell that The Last Witch Hunter will cast in insufferable, confusing fashion.
8071	4	a	Merely a solid, conventional drama, because it ultimately loses sight of one very important fact: Eminem is at his best when he's making people angry, not when he's asking for their sympathy.
8072	4	a	...a dark satire, a black comedy, and a slick slasher rolled into one.
8073	4	a	I can't imagine many beside Wilson pulling off a line about an Audrey Hepburn sex fantasy involving butter and having it come off as adoring and respectful. 
8074	0	a	Excellent but mature film about finding a connection.
8075	5	a	Was it really worth the effort? For all Fincher's famously fanatical control, he can't dispel the stench of half-baked cheese that hangs over the source material.
8076	4	a	"I've got a fourth verb to add to the comma-challenged title of Julia Roberts' how-to-be-happy travelogue, Eat Pray Love. How about ""edit""?"
8077	3	a	...a reflective film and, in its eccentric way, a comical one.
8078	4	a	Squint at Skyfall and you'll swear you're watching Bruce Wayne
8079	9	a	Targeted at pre-schoolers yet with scant educational value, Arctic Tale is best seen by no-one.
8080	1	a	Those who know Stallone only from his muscle-bound muscle-head roles in mindless action pictures are in for a surprise.
8081	4	a	[A] cute comedy drama inspired by a true story.
8082	5	a	It's OK to be retro with your screen romance, but retro shouldn't feel this inept.
8083	2	a	Like the little boy in The Incredibles who hangs around, slack-jawed, just to see what his superhero neighbours will do next, kids can't seem to get enough of this hyperactive carry-on.
8084	0	a	There will be tears.
8085	2	a	Charming. I wanted to sing all the way home and make some clothes out of my favorite curtains.
8086	6	a	One minute, you think you're watching a serious actioner; the next, it's as though clips from The Pink Panther Strikes Again and/or Sailor Moon have been spliced in.
8087	5	a	Too bad the filmmakers felt compelled to give this sufficiently charming doodle some emotional heft by veering into Four Weddings and a Funeral territory. It only distracts you from The Wedding Date's own modest charms.
8088	7	a	The Light Between Oceans is a painfully slow and obvious melodrama. I felt every second of its two hour and twelve minute runtime.
8089	5	a	Bargain basement caper.
8090	9	a	Loud, grisly, action-packed and profoundly un-scary.
8091	6	a	That's what's so confusing about David Twohy's A Perfect Getaway as it appears to attempt to be clever and original, only it ends up being one of the most obvious thrillers I've seen in years... and the audience ate it up.
8092	3	a	The franchise is showing no fear at exploring the novels' darker moments, but needs to judiciously pare down the time it takes for the lights to come up.
8093	3	a	The paranormal is the least disturbing of the elements here, played with a gleefully operatic excess, and more than a whiff of the disturbing exoticism of Grand Guignol at work in the passions unleashed.
8094	2	a	Simon is the best gay protagonist that [a] post-Hughes teen comedy could give us. [Full review in Spanish]
8095	4	a	The action is flashy and intermittent, deliberately wallowing in a mire of revisionist grot, churned up vistas of European mud. Time has made it more intuitive and caustic a film, than its daft reputation might suggest.
8096	4	a	Although it's not as hermetic and impenetrable as The Master, Inherent Vice still comes off as a giant inside joke to anyone who hasn't read Pynchon's novel.
8097	4	a	Delivers precisely what is expected to its fans...The super-high quality of the animation, which places Alvin, Theodore and Simon in the real world, remains a real highlight in these innocuous adventures - it really is an unrecognised art. 
8098	5	a	A lot of the themes and language in the movie haven't aged well...the soundtrack is amazing, though.
8099	5	a	Here, Woo just seems to fall back on slow-mo whenever he gets bored, which apparently is often.
8100	4	a	Several of the hard issues involving childhood -- getting accepted in a new neighborhood, getting accepted buy a new stepdad -- are handled with sensitivity.
8101	6	a	Why, in the name of all that is campy, can't a movie featuring a dynamite-loaded crossbow just have some fun?
8102	7	a	All Ms. Jovovich, as the sanctified heroine, has to do is look radiant, grimly purposeful and mildly alarmed while forcing open doors, wielding wrenches and fleeing monsters.
8103	3	a	Look, I'm not talking about a masterpiece here. What I am talking about is a good film trying desperately to break out of the romantic comedy box and, for the most part, doing so.
8104	3	a	This film is either a profound investigation of recent Italian history and a loving look at the national psyche -- warts, poetry and all -- or else it's a really superb soap opera.
8105	5	a	Glibly portrays selfishness as a life choice, ranking gluttony on a par with finding God and a life partner.
8106	3	a	I can scarcely think of ways to improve this engrossing, original, near-brilliant production.
8107	3	a	The sweet assurance and guerrilla wit of Robert Altman's vintage ensemble films makes a serenely captivating return.
8108	6	a	There's a lot in this nostalgic Sylvester Stallone actioner that lives up to its title - the recycled plot, the forgettable characters, the monotonous violence - but it's an undeniable kick to see these vets in action.
8109	1	a	The Coens' first film since their leaden remake of The Ladykillers is an exceptional return to their Blood Simple roots, offering up a crime saga in which money is almost as irresistible as bad choices are inevitable.
8110	7	a	The Dream Master has a sort of constant level of goofy idiocy.
8111	3	a	This is rich material that Moretti mines for both superficial absurdity and deep pathos. But he refuses to forge an orthodox happy ending, let alone a tinny satire.
8112	6	a	As a chronicle of the artist Michelangelo, this is one of Carol Reed's most underwhelming films, though some of the production values are good.
8113	4	a	From the performances to the presentation there is much to like about The Light Between Oceans, but little that makes us want to fully embrace it.
8114	4	a	This second succulent serving of Harry Potter may be all over the map like a feeble-minded person looking for interstate highway directions, but it does lend itself to do what it's suppose to do...whisk diehard moviegoers away to another dynamic dimension
8115	3	a	Skyfall shakes together familiar elements of the Ian Fleming canon - the cars, the guns, the exotic locales with the dames to match - into a blistering comic book escapade that the old Bond, and one suspects Fleming too, would find altogether alien.
8116	7	a	A silly inane story lacking strong characters and ay sense of adventure.
8117	3	a	Writer-director Nimrod Antal shifts from breakneck action to thoughtful romance ..., as he reveals a colorful and chaotic underground.
8118	6	a	Lecter is fascinating because he's an enigma; his deadly allure more appealing because his past is a mystery.
8119	6	a	Is this the future of horror or just some bizarre fluke? Don't ask me, I'm having too much fun to care.
8120	5	a	While bland and generic, the title certainly is fitting.
8121	4	a	An old-fashioned, unpretentious epic that reliably gets where it needs to go.
8122	6	a	Despite its radical potential, it's disappointing to see this story fall back on what's considered typical teen stuff.
8123	2	a	"The late Jim Henson would have been proud of the job that his son did directing this production. It's a solid Muppets feature. Call it ""The Muppets Take Dickensian London."
8124	4	a	The slow-burn build-up to a final showdown is, of course, a standard Western narrative device, but director Gavin O'Connor repeatedly defuses tension by cutting away to convoluted flashbacks revealing the characters' emotionally tangled backstories.
8125	0	a	Forget Saving Private Ryan, and Schindler's List. This is Spielberg's masterwork.
8126	4	a	...can't help but come off as the most needless installment of the bunch...
8127	4	a	There's enough meaty plot and character left beneath the fancy effects to make watching the film a satisfying experience.
8128	4	a	...a lament over lost culture.
8129	4	a	When you get past the subtle flourishes, the warmth generated by the ensemble, and the individual character marvels, Cookie's Fortune is so slight a work it's amazing it was ever made at all.
8130	6	a	A potentially decent little fantasy-comedy, which unfortunately settles for cheap sentiment and oddly out-of-place humor when it could be -- should be -- aiming much higher.
8131	3	a	Yes, there are a lot of in-jokes, but they are consistently funny, and Ralph and Vanellope have a gift for turning standard tropes sideways.
8132	6	a	There's pun-laden dialogue and slapstick violence aplenty, but the meta element feels sloppy.
8133	0	a	Jenkins' superlative work proves her first film was no fluke; let's hope it doesn't take another nine years to hear from her again.
8134	1	a	Nebraska is an engaging, funny and altogether touching road trip that moviegoers of different ages might want to consider taking.
8135	3	a	As cautionary tales about consumerism go, The Joneses manages a deft blend of the sexy, the sad and the silly. And Borte doles out his secrets and surprises in ways that make it easy to keep up with these Joneses.
8136	5	a	It's a noble failure, felt all the more because Anderson's films are usually so aesthetically and thematically rich and rewarding...
8137	1	a	An honest, moving, and occasionally even funny portrait of what happens when a cripplingly immature young man gets hit with one reality check after another.
8138	5	a	After about an hour ... the film undergoes a precipitous decline marked by absurdity and Victorian sentiment.
8139	3	a	Bleak but beautiful. An arty, ultra-realistic take on the post-apocalyptic genre. 
8140	4	a	Never gets past the superficial.
8141	4	a	Edge doesn't aspire to be anything more than a juicy British wartime soap opera, but when it finds delicious pockets of whispered betrayal, artistic impotency, and cherry-lipped invitation, it adds up to a convincing sit.
8142	4	a	There is some charm to the story, but the final act is very neat, predictable, contrived, and not up to originality of the first two. 
8143	4	a	You don't have to be a fashionista to get something out of this unique documentary about the famous designer, his way of working, and his long term relationship with business partner Giancarlo Giammetti.
8144	3	a	Marvelous characters in messy script.
8145	5	a	Depp and Jolie together create a chemical black hole. They couldn't produce sparks with dry hair and a comb.
8146	1	a	Ron Howard's direction provides excitement and suspense, even if you already know the outcome.
8147	2	a	This is a lush, deeply pleasurable film to experience on a sensory level; Almodovar couldn't produce a boring frame if he left the lens cap on.
8148	4	a	Much like Bourne, the film is a lean, mean, killing machine, and the action, near constant, is frightfully good.
8149	1	a	A movie as incandescent as its title.
8150	3	a	Apart from a contrived ending, Jindabyne comes as close as can be to a perfect drama.
8151	2	a	This is a horror story only Almodovar could conjure. It's filled with his style of melodrama and love for the disenfranchised, not to mention a seedy undercurrent that is sure to turn off some. A film for strong minds and sturdy hearts.
8152	2	a	...more 'chick flick' than recent Oscar-nom'ed Austen adaptations, but it's cut from more or less the same cloth, albeit less durable.
8153	0	a	Hormonal strife is seldom this joyous, and the tremendous verbal sparring between Steinfeld and Harrelson brings a modern, post-ironic gloss to the rat-a-tat delivery of Golden Age Hollywood comedy.
8154	5	a	Brannon composes the odd amusing sight gag, but homogenises his notionally eastern backdrop terribly ...
8155	4	a	For all the pains it takes to establish mood and character, Jindabyne hides under its own uneasy surfaces; it never allows enough sense of what this community really is, of what's to be grieved when it comes apart.
8156	6	a	...it's a B-movie that manages to be more than a potboiler.
8157	3	a	That rare comedy sequel that is just as effective and as funny as the original, while introducing new ideas and characters into the mix.
8158	6	a	This gender-bending period film is not particularly rich in ideas, but its serves as a showcase for Glenn Close, who has not had a good leading screen role in years, and Janet McTeeer in the supporting category.
8159	9	a	It is sincere, well-meaning and, I'm sorry to say, quite transparent hokum.
8160	10	a	The times they are a-changin': a frat comedy with a gender-balanced main cast, a non-judgemental gay wedding and nary a frat boy in sight.
8161	1	a	This is easily Ms. Zellweger's finest work.
8162	1	a	The film not only entertains us, but stimulates questions about journalistic integrity in foreign countries, about politics and about women's perceptions and rights.
8163	3	a	[A] stirring, character-driven study.
8164	4	a	Though the film was a box-office dud in the US, Brooks delivers an amusing and consistenly engaging relationship piece that is a cut above the standard romantic comedy. 
8165	3	a	With its well-constructed screenplay, sharp dialogue and unapologetic sincerity, this first feature from former SNL interns Colin Trevorrow and Derek Connolly is its own act of nostalgia...
8166	3	a	"Politically incorrect to a broad spectrum of social cliques, ""Dreamz"" makes a statement and has some fun at the same time."
8167	3	a	The Bourne Supremacy not only lives up to the promises of the novel by Robert Ludlum, but in many ways manages to improve on the first film.
8168	0	a	A superbly restrained piece of filmmaking, with Zinnemann directing in simple, unadorned style and Hepburn giving a truly radiant performance.
8169	1	a	Tinged with shadows and ignited by Lawrence and Cooper, Silver Linings Playbook raises the bar on romantic comedy. It's crazy good.
8170	3	a	[Klapisch] forces us to notice the ordinary details we ordinarily sleepwalk through.
8171	1	a	Purists might prefer simply to listen to the original recordings, but for those less knowledgeable this is a great introduction.
8172	2	a	Manages to be a deeper, more meaningful chapter in this brain-scrambled saga, enjoying the rush of nostalgia and renewed danger as it deals with a crisis that's more universal than substance abuse: aging. 
8173	1	a	In her directorial debut, writer Jennifer Westfeldt has single-handedly restored both the romance and comedy to the sadly abused romantic comedy genre.
8174	4	a	manages to be energetic, entertaining, and surprisingly mature
8175	6	a	The movie is designed to play for one audience and one audience only: existing Jackass fans.
8176	6	a	Habemus Papam gets lost in the secular wilderness, as the incognito Pontiff wanders about Rome, mixing with the common flock, in an overly pat commentary on the burden of infallibility.
8177	4	a	If the script never rises above the sitcom level, at least the lines are delivered by people who are so good they almost seem like wit.
8178	2	a	There are brilliant individual moments of inspiration here that surpass anything done in Wreck-It Ralph, but for the most part it's just a remastering of the first film.
8179	0	a	It would be wrong to single out any one of these performances. Eastwood has assembled a bonanza cast here and each comes out shining.
8180	5	a	This overlong melodrama has all the dramatic grace of a wrecked-my-truck, lost-my-girl song-and about as much emotional heft.
8181	1	a	Still Alice is heartbreaking but it doesn't earn its tears through easy emotional manipulation.
8182	3	a	An evocative journey through a changing world in search of a culture that's disappearing before the travellers' eyes.
8183	3	a	classic comedy
8184	9	a	This movie has no focus, no point of view and nothing to say. Is this a sendup? Is this an actual thriller? Is this just a look into the soul of a drug addict? I have no idea, and I don't think Werner Herzog knows either.
8185	3	a	The Savages is funny in the if-you-didn't-laugh-you'd-cry way and superbly acted by all involved
8186	0	a	As rich and bleeding a work as [Eastwood has] ever made.
8187	4	a	Despite a captivating-as-always performance by Morgan Freeman, [it] ends up rather dull and underwhelming while lacking enough sharp attention on the dynamics of Mandela's friendship with Francois Pienaar off of the rugby field.
8188	4	a	As infuriating and inconsistent as a film can get. Some of its scenes are quite dull and dry, yet others are fascinating and funny. And others still are just head-scratchingly weird.
8189	4	a	For a horror cheese-fest about six ill-fated teens on the verge of brutal maceration by inbred hick monsters, Wrong Turn is surprisingly worth the detour
8190	4	a	The movie as a whole looks and occasionally plays better than it is.
8191	4	a	A definite crowd-pleaser, although you can see the series start to slide downhill
8192	5	a	A whole lot of padding turns a fine enough story into a dour, wordy slog.
8193	6	a	A road trip with three-course meals in rich sauces; pleasant to watch, but not as easy to digest.
8194	3	a	This is, unquestionably, the best comedy currently on release. Highly recommended.
8195	4	a	It's a genuinely experimental film, intermittently successful despite a punishing lack of depth in the characterisations.
8196	6	a	Having established his characters and built their bond, having cooked up a sense of place so strong you can taste it, Brewer can't find anywhere in particular to go. Suddenly he brings a gun into the mix, then takes an awkward Dr. Phil turn.
8197	9	a	Quite possibly [Murray's] worst movie ever.
8198	6	a	...an interesting character study...
8199	4	a	[Benedict Cumberbatch] has had a meteoric rise, and for good reason -- he's really good at what he does. Here, he does a lot with a little.
8200	6	a	This Valentine to Civil War brigades of yore doesn't come close to illustrating the genuine passion and suffering behind the scenes.
8201	3	a	Witty, warm and wise in spite of its contrivances and schmaltz. It's one of the best romantic teen comedies in recent memory. It deserves to become a sleeper hit and a cult classic. 
8202	1	a	Every element comes together to create a piece of gonzo genius we won't soon forget... I dare you not to love every minute of it.
8203	6	a	The strangest and most confused of the Dracula films up to that point, and the first of Hammer's vampire films where the bad elements seriously threaten to outnumber the good.
8204	3	a	It's serious with a capital 'S.' It's the kind of grimness that smacks of a bid for Importance with a capital 'I' -- hopefully leading to an Oscar with a captial 'O.'
8205	3	a	A comedy that has likeable, human characters as well as consistent laughs.
8206	9	a	Stillborn, pointless piece of work.
8207	5	a	"A cheap rip-off of ""Rosemary's Baby"" has little in the way of chills."
8208	4	a	Dreamz is amusing enough; but be prepared for comedy that's more crass than class. If you want refinement, see the more clever Thank You for Smoking.
8209	5	a	Probably the worst of the series. Still provides a few laughs.
8210	8	a	Mirrors the plot of the original point for point. All that's missing is little things like subtlety, nuance, characterization, and human interest.
8211	5	a	Worst of the Roger Moore Bond films has a license to bore.
8212	6	a	Although Jindabyne's cinematography features sweeping scenes of the Australian countryside as stunning as any of those opening shots from Brokeback Mountain, it ultimately has some bigger issues.
8213	6	a	Preachy and predictable.
8214	0	a	The man who once stole every film he did, bending it to his comic will, tranquilly inhabits LOST IN TRANSLATION... Understatement is his tool now.
8215	9	a	The only reason I'd Think again is the return of Kevin Hart, who mines comic gold out of sloppy seconds.
8216	1	a	The Incredibles is aptly-named. It tells the surprisingly relatable story it intends to tell in a time and place that feels unique from our own yet approachable.
8217	0	a	What a perverse little gem this is.
8218	3	a	Saturday afternoon matinee fun. Think Conan the Barbarian clashing with the gods of Clash of the Titans who are conquering Mars, Gladiator style.
8219	3	a	Bleed For This is both cinematic and interesting without losing sight of the man from Rhode Island who wore the gloves.
8220	3	a	Shanghai Noon is a Jackie Chan flick set in the Old West. If that inventive screwball setup isn't enough by itself to get you itching to see the movie, please feel free to read on.
8221	4	a	Gradually mutates into a debate about the singularity of the soul, the spectre of reincarnation rearing its unexpected head under laboratory conditions.
8222	5	a	A depressing, lugubrious film experience.
8223	4	a	"If you're searching for smart, soulful teen entertainment, you can start looking inside ""Paper Towns."
8224	9	a	Ready Player One is the first Spielberg film I can remember that feels contemptuous.
8225	0	a	'American Hustle' is smart, sophisticated and slick. Director David O. Russell has been nominated for the Academy Award for both last year's 'Silver Linings Playbook' and 'The Fighter,' and he's bound to earn at least a nod again this year.
8226	2	a	Selma stands as a rigorous film that does justice to the figure of Martin Luther King. [Full review in Spanish]
8227	3	a	What masquerades as a comical character study and a sweet relationship drama turns out to be a sharp, if inconsequential, caper flick.
8228	0	a	"Carol"" is a love story for the ages, a film you feel like you may be walking toward, like Therese does at one point, entranced and lovelorn, forever."
8229	5	a	Despite Winslet's stunning cowgirl fashionista, The Dressmaker is a whole lot of weirdness packed into a story that stumbles around like an emotionally-inept drunk.
8230	3	a	A beguiling and intimate change of pace for Payne.
8231	3	a	It is marvelously romantic, even though - or precisely because - it acknowledges the disappointment that shadows every genuine expression of romanticism.
8232	9	a	Mr. Franco must have had a very boring adolescence, because Palo Alto is a very boring movie.
8233	4	a	Land of the Dead is a banquet of nasty thrills for those who like their horror dashed with allegory and satire, as well as blood, guts and gore.
8234	7	a	It's a bitter pill to swallow, but it's a dark day indeed when a film can bring together so many promising elements and, when the curtains close, leave you wondering exactly what the heck you just sat through -- and if you even enjoyed it at all.
8235	5	a	It all feels recycled and re-recycled.
8236	1	a	The Assassination of Jesse James is less of a Western than a mid-Western, which refers both to the film's urban Missouri center of gravity and its pivoting position between horse opera and backstage intrigue.
8237	4	a	So-so Whoopi comedy-thriller. There are worse things and she's made some of them.
8238	3	a	One of the strengths of James White is its subtlety. It has things to say about modern life and especially the twentysomething male experience, but they are never said as much as pictured.
8239	7	a	... feels cobbled together by a committee fresh from a marathon of family reunion and summer camp comedies.
8240	6	a	Everything that happens here has happened in dozens of romantic comedies before. If you're thinking of going to see Dogs, all I can say is: you've already seen it.
8241	3	a	Ron Shelton, whose Bull Durham and White Men Can't Jump were jokey tales of disillusionment set in the sporting world, here redefines the life of an idol with a certain honest savagery.
8242	4	a	Light, frothy, and ever-so-British fun.
8243	2	a	History never fails to repeat itself. The factional fighting in colorfully picturesque Sixteenth Century England is mirrored today in the grayer environment of the U.S.
8244	3	a	A sharp, witty, and revealing take that shows us, among other things, that we never really leave middle school when it comes to wanting to be just like the cool kids. 
8245	3	a	As predictable as The Lazarus Effect may be, it's a well-crafted and effective horror film.
8246	4	a	For much of its first half, The Rover cruises on grit and atmosphere. Ultimately, however, I struggled with the mysteries of what was motivating these central characters.
8247	0	a	"Inherent Vice"" is a film about a stoner which itself seems stoned. This is just one small part of what makes it distinctive."
8248	6	a	A premise in search of a thesis, a handful of scenes in search of a story.
8249	3	a	"Spy Kids"" is a smart, upscale, slick comedy adventure film that has something for everyone from kids to adults."
8250	3	a	A majestic biopic that digs more deeply into the character of Jesse James than has ever been done before. Will disappoint fans of shoot-em-ups, though.
8251	5	a	Fans of the first will find some amusement in familiarity, but with such a comically able cast this is a missed opportunity.
8252	0	a	Texas prodigy Trey Edward Shults creates a Night of the Living Dead for these paranoid us-against them times.
8253	6	a	The Expendables isn't as much fun as it should be.
8254	0	a	A rarity: a highly anticipated film that exceeds - and confounds - expectations.
8255	0	a	In addition to being the first great independent movie, Citizen Kane is the first great character drama.
8256	5	a	"In all it's an unconvincing portrait, and as the Dylan clone says, ""Empty, like one of those cans of soup..."
8257	0	a	After a summer of far too many loud, but ultimately empty superhero films, Nebraska is a blessed relief.
8258	7	a	OK, ignore the transsexual cows. The whole thing is such a mish-mash of genres, from Ferris Bueller's Day Off to Animal Farm to Lion King, that it's something we've seen 'til the cows come hom
8259	5	a	Sausage Party has moments of delicious flavor, unfortunately, as a meal it will leave you famished.
8260	5	a	What The Prestige and filmmaker Nolan seem to have forgotten about magic is the very important element of misdirection. Without misdirection, an audience is bound to discover the trick and not be impressed.
8261	4	a	While the film isn't exactly groundbreaking, it does finish much better than it begins.
8262	7	a	While this farcical thriller can certainly be classified as a no-brainer, it is only on the grounds of sustained mindlessness that the tag truly sticks.
8263	6	a	Compare this to the output of a studio like Pixar, and the movie really fits its title: a second-rate computer-animated comedy.
8264	1	a	Friedkin directs; his taste for sadism has never been personified better than in McConaughey's unassuming-but-dangerous drawl.
8265	6	a	"Even by the standards of this franchise-and this genre in general-""Step Up All In"" is pretty laughable."
8266	5	a	The payoff for sitting through How Do You Know is as predictable as it gets.
8267	2	a	A velvet drenched romp through the world of a con man but most of the time it's like watching a Las Vegas Martin Scorsese tribute show
8268	3	a	One thing is certain: Gibson has delivered a film so visceral, so unwavering in his commitment, that it makes most other Jesus movies look pale and tepid.
8269	4	a	Valkyrie isn't a classic war movie by any means, but is it the total laughing stock many feared? Nein.
8270	2	a	In the hands of Adams, the evolution elicits as much sympathy as it does laughter, largely because she grounds every pivotal moment in wide-eyed kindness and generosity, pushing us to care about her fate.
8271	2	a	As the teenage Damien, Jonathan Scott-Taylor works wonders with the role
8272	9	a	Half-assed storytelling and dull performances
8273	9	a	Orthodontic surgery would be more fun than watching this
8274	3	a	...half terrific movie and half run-of-the-mill biopic
8275	3	a	A racially and politically charged biopic full of vivid violent imagery that is sure to haunt viewers, and an emotionally gripping performance from David Oyelowo as the spiritual civil rights movement leader
8276	3	a	But McDonagh's vision and style is something of its own, and it operates on its own bloody terms. 
8277	3	a	Smart, funny, whimsical--one of the best romantic comedies in recent years.
8278	5	a	[A] self-important, derivative and muddled sci-fi thriller.
8279	3	a	Moviegoers need another film about the drug trade as much as they need a hole in the head -- or, more specifically, a cocaine-caused hole in the nose -- but The Infiltrator does just enough right to make it a welcome addition to the canon.
8280	1	a	"Despite all the great things you'll hear about ""Selma"" - an important, Oprah-endorsed awards-season biopic - it actually is great."
8281	4	a	Here's something truly weird: as soon as I was back in the real world, Cosmopolis knocked me sideways.
8282	0	a	It's an extraordinary work of vision and passion that raises even the gifted Spielberg to a new level of artistry. And like all great works, it elevates everyone who views it.
8283	1	a	In the wrong hands, this film could have been grating melodrama. Under Garcia's watchful eye, this is an ode to mothers and children who are lost but not forgotten.
8284	3	a	Not only its a hysterically raunchy and jaw dropping comedy, but manages to have food for thought with a risky theme that you don't see in many films.
8285	3	a	...The Edge's fusion of Mametspeak with a true life adventure remains brawny entertainment, even it it is difficult to take as seriously as the filmmakers intend.
8286	3	a	The Bourne Identity is an intense, violent, bite-your-nails-to-the-quick thriller.
8287	9	a	A lame blend of comedy and action in which both credibility and laughs are blown to smithereens.
8288	4	a	Mickey and the Beanstalk is the classic here, and worth the price of the DVD.
8289	9	a	Identity Thief apparently forgets it was supposed to be a comedy.
8290	9	a	Some would argue that kids aren't as jaded as adults, and will enjoy an agonizingly unfunny experience like Daddy Day Camp just fine. Using the same rationale, you could feed them Alpo.
8291	4	a	Krasinski preserves Wallace's whooshing roller coasters of words, powered by the fuel of confession.
8292	4	a	It isn't the wildest safari you'll ever go on, but it has plenty of attractions to offer less cynical visitors.
8293	4	a	A seemingly hopeless spiral of existence ... there is some depraved glee that this filmmaker takes in toying with his hapless cast, and his latest film is no exception nor for the faint-hearted.
8294	3	a	A mesmerizing technical achievement.
8295	3	a	Martial arts have rarely been filmed with so much artistry.
8296	0	a	The best time I've had at the movies all year.
8297	1	a	Perhaps the best live-action comedy sequel since 'Addams's Family Values'.
8298	4	a	Though Dunsmore, Depp and Jeffreys' conceits work more vividly as ideas than as filmmaking, they're ruthlessly true to themselves and grimly powerful.
8299	4	a	Depicted as a bunch of glowing shadows shuffling around in a blue haze, the hereafter might be the world's last smoking lounge.
8300	3	a	I still think the movie loses steam when it goes indoors -- but one cannot deny its influence
8301	6	a	A weird movie that could have stood to be weirder still.
8302	4	a	A hugely enjoyable experience that's sadly let down by a rather lacklustre and uninspiring ending.
8303	3	a	Make a little room Lady, Tramp and all you Dalmatians, Disney's got a new animated dog to bark about.
8304	2	a	A quirky, dramatic and totally entertaining movie that features someof the best acting of the year.
8305	3	a	It lollops along to its own lazy drumbeat, perfectly evoking that too-brief time of life when you could pass the evenings drunk on stolen beer and all the spare time you could dream of.
8306	9	a	A drama whose characters are so sketchy and unpleasant they keep tripping over the movie's one-note ideas.
8307	3	a	Driven by a series of invigorating and breathtaking action sequences and anchored by a Bond of rare emotional depth.
8308	4	a	The concept and the jokes aren't great, but there's a whooshing, kid-pleasing flair to the film, and it gets away with a few brazenly commercial nods to other Disney movies. 
8309	1	a	Eastwood has handed Penn the role of a lifetime, and the actor scorches the screen with his anguish and angry vengefulness.
8310	1	a	You literally can look, unobscured, at the behemoth wreck. And that's a pretty amazing sight.
8311	1	a	What makes Jackson's film enthralling and frightening is the way it shows these two unhappy girls, creating an alternative world so safe and attractive they thought it was worth killing for.
8312	5	a	Overlong, risible and plodding historical blockbuster.
8313	2	a	A film that is political in nature and very controversial for the Iranian authorities to deal with...
8314	4	a	There is a certain slapdash energy and heedless silliness to the proceedings that is somewhat engaging, certainly more so than the hateful likes of Date Movie.
8315	3	a	Great to see very late Cagney in solid Milos Forman film.
8316	0	a	Carol is gorgeous, gently groundbreaking, and might be the saddest thing you'll ever see.
8317	3	a	Being Lean's favourite of his films this is undoubtedly worthy of attention.
8318	3	a	Hitch has us from hello.
8319	0	a	Seventy minutes into the film, there's a rude burst of mariachi music as the hero awakes... That wouldn't be worth noting, except that we suddenly realize that for the first tense, suspense-filled hour of the film there has been no music at all.
8320	4	a	That the film even got made and is reasonably competent should be seen as a victory in itself.
8321	2	a	Light and gimmicky, self-reflexive and shallow, Allen's time-travel romantic comedy is an amusing, occasionally witty love letter to Paris the city and the myth.
8322	8	a	There are no surprises to get excited about, and Forster's stylistic choices tend to push the film into tedium
8323	2	a	A fun story with some creative characters and plenty of Pixar wit.
8324	2	a	Even vehicles on autopilot eventually reach their destinations, and Dogs proves to be an easy ride
8325	6	a	The movie purports to be a comic meditation on metaphysics, but it has no intellectual resonance and resembles nothing so much as a sendup of psychotherapy.
8326	2	a	There are only two reasons to see this movie. Catherine Zeta-Jones, who is drop-dead gorgeous, and the stunts, which are way cool.
8327	4	a	Pooh's Heffalump Movie is much like a children's cardboard storybook and is set to the cozy soundtrack of Carly Simon. It's as sweet as hunny and breezy to follow, and before you know it, it's over and everyone is smiling.
8328	3	a	This dazzling film and first-rate thriller holds you spellbound and doesn't let go.
8329	5	a	Coarse tale of family and Thanksgiving for teens.
8330	4	a	Offers a charming distraction from the current campaign season by sidestepping real issues and making light of the process.
8331	3	a	Morally complex -- and very entertaining.
8332	2	a	The quirk occasionally walks right up to the line of unbearable, but it's Paper Heart's unabashedly bared soul that saves it in the end.
8333	4	a	A sexy thriller that's got plenty of libido but not nearly as much brains as it thinks it has.
8334	3	a	Love, Simon succeeds because it rarely plays like grown-ups talking down to viewers.
8335	9	a	Scripted by Crank scribes Mark Neveldine and Brian Taylor, and starring a game Josh Brolin, this probably looked good on paper.
8336	1	a	"Safety Not Guaranteed"" not only has dialogue that's about something, but characters who have some depth and dimension."
8337	1	a	The experience of watching Trainspotting -- the electric, nasty and slick descent into the milieu of young Scottish junkies -- is a little like speeding through the digestive tract of some voracious beast.
8338	3	a	One of the most completely satisfying of all sci-fi films.
8339	6	a	Not bad. It is funny and touching at times, even though the premise is pretty close to impossible.
8340	5	a	"Tonight a very special ""Will and Grace."" Grace goes to London without Will. Dermot Mulrooney guest stars."
8341	10	a	The humor is all over the place. It's a film that hopes that shaking a pig's butt or drinking pee-filled water will get the easy laughs from the youngest viewers while the adults in the audience count the second until they can leave.
8342	1	a	It was the beast that launched a thousand monster movies.
8343	7	a	The film is less a blend of genres than one big mess. 
8344	5	a	Hereafter asks for no such leaps of faith. It offers no poignancy or spirit; merely an obtuse interpretation of the never-never, book-ended with shrugs.
8345	4	a	A certain sunny sloppiness almost redeems Jon Amiel's throwback caper flick
8346	0	a	A deeply felt and intelligent film, one of those that has grown in my mind on a second viewing; it is almost certainly the best of Campion's career, exposing The Piano as overrated and overegged.
8347	4	a	[Cholodenko's] smart script and sensitive directing make up for sluggish pacing, the picture's one major flaw.
8348	4	a	So light it's near flyaway, but grounded by canny casting and heartfelt performances, A Royal Night Out is a sugary shot of pure fantasy.
8349	4	a	A good sequel in the series directed by trash auteur Renny Harlin with just the right flair.
8350	2	a	I know I've seen a good funny animal movie if I stop eating the animal in real life.
8351	6	a	It's a lot of smoke, but too few mirrors.
8352	3	a	It's not about being scary and its not about shocking you with torture porn, Final Destination is simply about stupid fun.
8353	1	a	Of all the new Halloween films, only this one has the power to truly haunt our dreams.
8354	7	a	The one aspect of preteen life that the film gets spot-on is the intense bonds of friendship right before the hormones kick in.
8355	0	a	It's most memorable due to the heartfelt sterling performance by the seventy-something Victor Seastrom.
8356	3	a	Taking three of your favorite drag queens and some alcoholic contraband to this movie equals a windfall of instant camp.
8357	8	a	Another laughably bad movie based on a popular video-game title.
8358	0	a	On the plus side of the ledger, Russell enables his cast to inhabit some colorful, downright transformative, characters.
8359	4	a	There are a few too many plot holes and logical errors. Rising Sun may be solidly-paced, but not all aspects of the production are as successful.
8360	4	a	The films strength is its performances. Costner is especially good as a man whose grief brings forth a deep seeded anger, especially when confronted with the threat of losing the one thing left in his life that he loves.
8361	4	a	Even when the feather-light plot gets into a freeform flap, the trade-off is an energised kind of knowing, anarchic playfulness: the sort that favours spewed-up bird food gags over vomit-inducing homilies.
8362	6	a	Marshall can't decide whether he's making a thriller or a laff-it-up lark.
8363	1	a	If you don't think Ben Stiller is funny, Spanglish is playing at the next theater over. Meet The Fockers made me laugh so hard my stomach started to ache.
8364	6	a	Despite the fine acting, you may end up feeling as suckered as Roy's victims.
8365	0	a	Takes the viewer on a dizzying ride through dark comedy, wrenching tragedy, shocking moments, karmic twists, and redemption. 
8366	9	a	The only jaws to watch out for in this film are yours, hitting the floor.
8367	5	a	Alternately sweet and kind of creepy...an invitation you might want to skip.
8368	7	a	Its series of weak excuses and cliched insights illuminate nothing, and the movie ends up little more than a lesbian slasher flick.
8369	7	a	An overly-hyped exercise, a cynical attempt to couple recognizable action stars with their respective muscles onscreen ... think of this not so much a film but, rather, steroid abuse of a whole other kind.
8370	7	a	The shoddiest thing Eastwood has ever directed. By far.
8371	4	a	There's the odd giggle, but nowhere near enough to keep things going.
8372	0	a	This bleak ending, with Antoine turning to stare into the camera, is among the most famous shots in cinema history, and for good reason.
8373	3	a	This is an affecting and thoroughly worthwhile film on a very contemporary topic - with some Larkinian reflections on what will and won't survive of us.
8374	4	a	Like last year's Crazy Heart, this film traces the journey of a struggling addict country singer. And while the film is somewhat sentimental and simplistic, it features some strong acting that manages to draw us in.
8375	2	a	Affectionate and amusing, it's uplifting, feel-good family entertainment.
8376	1	a	Like many of Gilliam's cerebral, impish films, Munchausen toes the line between rationality and fantasy, gleefully incorporating both into the same story.
8377	2	a	Talent of Hughes brothers deserves viewer's attention even when their results don't meet such high standards.
8378	5	a	Simply a curiosity, a laughable relic of a failed effort to bring explicit sex movies to the masses.
8379	5	a	Isn't quite as funny as The Swarm...neither frisky nor imaginative enough to merit even its short ninety-minute running time.
8380	6	a	The story goes by the numbers.
8381	8	a	With all the A-list offspring in the credits of Orange County, it should have been a cut above the usual teen comedy. But it touches the same old bases in the same old dumb ways.
8382	5	a	A visually stunning, but emotionally empty sci-fi classic.
8383	1	a	"Silver Linings Playbook"" is so good, it could almost be a terrific old classic. "
8384	3	a	It may not have the wounding thrust of Ferrara's, but it shares with that film a bottomless compassion for its crazies, to say nothing of the exhilaration of seeing a fearless director and a fearless actor pushing each other beyond extremes.
8385	4	a	This endearing movie's mottoes are: never stop caring. And: the best way to make friends is to be a friend yourself.
8386	5	a	Another week, another glacial outing from the ever-expanding Coppola clan depicting the oh so beautiful emptiness of American teenage wildlife.
8387	3	a	Hopkins and Mirren take what could have been an ordinary film and elevate it to the status of one of the year's best. Hitchcock would be proud.
8388	9	a	A generic teen comedy brimming with patronizing stereotypes and lame in-jokes.
8389	5	a	The audience may find itself wondering how it is that Liz manages to find so many places around the world that can maintain her carefully highlighted hair rather than contemplating the spiritual journey 
8390	6	a	Though I enjoy nearly everyone on-screen in Couples Retreat, I found it pretty meager and more than a little depressing.
8391	9	a	No doubt, the outtakes on the DVD release will prove useful for recovering sex addicts and in vomitoria.
8392	4	a	It's actually closer to the original Chainsaw than its immediate predecessor, but it still relies on more on physical torture than the psychological terror that made the original - or any genuinely scary movie - so effective.
8393	2	a	You're very aware of its imperfections, but ultimately find it easy to like.
8394	3	a	It's a family movie with a heart and a brain. And if you aren't moved to tears, you might need an organ transplant.
8395	2	a	The good parts are really good and the bad parts are really bad.
8396	2	a	It is as much influenced by Looney Toons cartoons and Russ Meyer movies as it is by the anarchic new wave of action films. And it was edited, apparently, by someone with ADD.
8397	4	a	Often as likable as a frolicking puppy -- and always as messy.
8398	1	a	American Graffiti has a timeless power that speaks to everyone who was ever a teenager.
8399	3	a	The Grey Zone should be seen: It's a worthy ordeal, with flaws that, ironically, make grist for later arguments.
8400	6	a	Better than it has to be.
8401	1	a	Anderson moves further from conventional storytelling with each new film, and closer to something more intuitive, more damning, more true. He hasn't made it there yet. God help us when he does.
8402	10	a	A patently offensive, racist and repulsive waste of celluloid, an affront to blacks, whites and human beings in general.
8403	10	a	One of the worst films I've ever seen.
8404	5	a	The film feels like a flimsy attempt to get The Bellas back together. It's bereft of good ideas and tone deaf in terms of decent dialogue.
8405	3	a	The end of the dismal summer movie season couldn't have been blessed with a more satisfying coda than the rollicking, funny, relentlessly cheery and genuinely touching spirit that makes Roll Bounce a captivating delight from start to finish.
8406	4	a	There are some useful insights into the downside of youthful romantic obsession.
8407	3	a	Part family drama, part slick con picture, Matchstick Men works thanks to fantastic acting and a clever script with one giant twist.
8408	1	a	Wins you over with its devastating simplicity.
8409	4	a	Though not one of Oscar and Hammerstein best works, this Oscar-nominated musical about culture clash merits a viewing.
8410	6	a	With limitless absurdity comes a kind of glossy-eyed meaninglessness and extreme tastelessness.
8411	6	a	This is material more apt for a Coen Brothers treatment. Two-and-a-half hours of pretty, Paul Thomas Anderson-sculpted nonsense is a lot to take.
8412	3	a	Simple. Sweet. Effective. And it's always nice to revisit the Hundred Acre Wood.
8413	3	a	Ballet dancer Chi Cao does a great job of capturing both Li's chops on the stage and his sincerity and culture shock in the face of American opulence.
8414	5	a	[The film] oo often settles for easy, lazy jokes, most of which revolve around either food or running into stuff.
8415	5	a	How Do You Know takes the wholly possible scenario of two decent men courting one woman and turns it into a forced lark that can't bring itself to ask if she's worth it.
8416	6	a	"Despite its special effects and two proven stars, ""The House With a Clock in Its Walls"" never manages to create the magic we keep hoping will materialize."
8417	3	a	It's laugh-out-loud funny.
8418	6	a	A typical over-blown Hollywood production.
8419	1	a	A silent movie shot in sumptuous black-and-white, no less. A silent flick made with not a jot of distancing winking, but instead born of a heady affection for a bygone, very bygone, era of filmmaking.
8420	3	a	The Incredibles has humor, thrills, and adventure, but most of all it has heart.
8421	3	a	A gracefully subtle, sweet-spirited French parable of the brotherhood of man.
8422	0	a	It's not until the heartbreaking denouement you realise how immersive Tokyo Story is, and how it snuck up on you and worked its way into your heart.
8423	5	a	A ridiculous, confusing mess that just doesn't make any sense.
8424	1	a	Working slightly against it, it's got an elliptical approach that's initially emotionally disorienting, a plot structure that's been a bit too audaciously borrowed from Citizen Kane, of all things, and a rather vacant performance at [its]center.
8425	5	a	"Harrelson and Snipes reproduce their onscreen magic from ""White Men Can't Jump,"" even though no one asked them to"
8426	4	a	You, Me and Dupree overstays its welcome but a compilation reel of Wilson's scenes would make for fairly funny viewing.
8427	3	a	Brilliant dark comedy
8428	1	a	DiCaprio and Winslet deliver terrific performances.
8429	2	a	An exciting, frivolous ride through a vision of the future that may be bleaker than anything in Brazil.
8430	6	a	The characters in this film are weak-willed, pathetic losers. I just couldn't muster much sympathy for the characters that couldn't burst out of the cages of their own design.
8431	6	a	Would you rather have a second-tier film from a first-rate director, or a first-tier film from a second-rate director?
8432	4	a	A World War II prison break, survival, and morality tale about the power of forgiveness as an ideal to animate a lifetime. 
8433	4	a	... a classic example of a movie that isn't as good as the sum of its parts, but those individual parts are surprisingly entertaining
8434	3	a	The script is in keeping with the fabric of the film. It's languid and meanders about a bit, but, coupled with the lush and inviting Tuscany countryside, this is not a bad thing at all.
8435	5	a	Does it work as an ordinary movie? Not really. But I'm not sure it'll work in HFR either.
8436	5	a	Directed and written by Paul Thomas Anderson and starring Joaquin Phoenix are usually words that guarantee awesomeness. Not this time.
8437	3	a	Simple and direct, rather than a discovery.
8438	3	a	What keeps us involved in this perceptive film is the beautiful acting of its cast ... and the way the movie balances grim reality with bits of fancy that feel oddly perfect.
8439	3	a	The film does not preach; rather, it confronts us with the question: Now what are we going to do?
8440	0	a	If you sometimes like to go to the movies to have fun, Wasabi is a good place to start.
8441	9	a	I'm all for the mentally challenged getting their fair shot in the movie business, but surely it doesn't have to be as a collection of keening and self-mutilating sideshow geeks.
8442	6	a	...the movie's disappointingly flat atmosphere [is] perpetuated by Kitsch's competent yet bland work...
8443	4	a	Arctic Tale puts, if not a human face on the effects of climate change, then the next best thing: an anthropomorphized animal one.
8444	1	a	Directed with extraordinary skill by Sam Mendes, the film is a tough road well worth traveling.
8445	3	a	This up-close portrait delivers all the runway glamor and backstage gossip that fashionistas crave, yet it's also unexpectedly poignant.
8446	3	a	Ralph Breaks the Internet is a rare sequel that actually improves upon the original.
8447	3	a	Streamlining Larsson's clunky storytelling, Zaillan injects a welcome streak of humour into events, giving Craig - and the rest of the superb cast - a chance to be both funny and icily ominous.
8448	2	a	[The] real target is the polarized state of society. All extremes get an equal bashing here, as they well deserve.
8449	9	a	Sit, watch, groan. Yawn, fidget, stretch. Eat Snickers, pray for end of dire film about Julia Roberts's emotional growth, love the fact it can't last for ever. Wince, daydream, frown.
8450	8	a	It becomes apparent after only moments that the filmmakers are once more happy to reach for the lowest common denominator, slapping together an icky non-stop barrage of bodily functions, racial stereotyping and rancid epithets and call it a comedy.
8451	9	a	"A failure on nearly every level, ""A Million Ways to Die in the West"" almost approaches so-bad-you-need-to-see-it categorization."
8452	8	a	Dragging your boyfriend/husband to this movie will give him the leverage to demand multiple screenings of Jerry Bruckheimer films as penance. Ladies, you have been warned.
8453	5	a	First-time director Mark Helfrich brings a ham-fisted insistence on the obvious and a tendency to overstate raunchy humor until the raunch becomes a bore.
8454	3	a	The supporting cast, the direction and the musical score help, but Chaney is a serious stumbling block.
8455	3	a	Writer Lee Hall and director Stephen Daldy transform the material into an exhilarating, funny and deeply sad story of growing pains.
8456	4	a	Midnight in Paris is a breeze: a bauble, but a jolly one.
8457	3	a	Alpha Dog is a tragedy born of stupidity and weaned on depravity.
8458	9	a	Writer-director Jared Hess tries for John Hughes by way of the Coen Brothers, but only comes up with one dull, unfunny non-sequitur after another.
8459	3	a	It's as warm as a double shot of Ouzo, as exotic as chicken-lemon soup and as sweet as a plate of honey-dripped baklava.
8460	4	a	David Twohy's programmatic vacation thriller A Perfect Getaway is silly and fun and while it has its annoyingly meta moments it certainly won't leave you bored.
8461	6	a	It's a promising start for director Tze Chun, but despite the film's charms, the story doesn't get interesting enough early enough.
8462	7	a	The series takes the curious, surprising and rather brave route of ditching the street-racing shenanigans that defined the series in favor of a more standard action-oriented plot. It's an interesting approach, but the series' shallowness remains
8463	3	a	One of the great Guy Pearce performances -- mean, minimalist, and without a trace of vanity
8464	3	a	The pace is leisurely, the humor sly, and the cast superb. All in all, a civilized way to spend two hours.
8465	5	a	The film's respect for its source material goes only so far before reducing everything to the level of an old-style Saturday-morning cartoon, complete with stock characters finding themselves in stock situations.
8466	5	a	... while both of these performers look great together, they really don't seem to belong together.
8467	8	a	Frankly, I'm shocked by the number of critics who have been praising the film. To my mind, the movie doesn't even rate to be called camp. It's simply a bad idea gone wrong.
8468	6	a	...comes off as the latest misfire from erstwhile comedian Dane Cook...
8469	3	a	A film whose individual parts are more entrancing than the middlebrow whole.
8470	4	a	The real triumph of the film - apart from a beautifully shot, grand-scale recreation of Alexandria - is how it illustrates the vital importance of asking questions.
8471	0	a	Close earned that Oscar nomination, and seeing the movie will convince you of it as she gives the performance of a lifetime.
8472	5	a	If Disney started up a documentary division the they would probably have a similar tone to the hackneyed, tired, saccharin approach that Marsh has taken to tell what is actually a profoundly disturbing story.
8473	3	a	engaging power play of politics and military muscling.
8474	4	a	Something less than the sum of its parts, Matchstick Men is a decent film that should have been a considerably better one.
8475	4	a	Black populates his film with recognisable tropes and character types as well a grand throwback score, and there's a certain charm in his ability to conjure up the past without resorting to pastiche.
8476	3	a	"Green Hornet"" works both as an action movie and as a deconstruction of an action movie."
8477	4	a	Reign of Fire is a good show, hampered by the gnawing suspicion that it could have been better.
8478	5	a	There's no doubt it wants to be clever and deep. Unhappily, it's actually rather goofy.
8479	6	a	The script feels artificial largely because the main characters' dialogue comes across unnatural.
8480	2	a	Sure, it's a shamelessly manipulative film. But it works, because it creates believable, likeable people, and you cry when terrible things happen to people you like.
8481	6	a	No matter how you look at it, Vantage Point is a letdown.
8482	4	a	[T]here is no way to say it without employing a pun -- it leaves a truly bad taste.
8483	6	a	There's a lot of talk in How Do You Know, but not much worth saying.
8484	1	a	War of the Worlds is, hands down, the best big budget film of the summer. Maybe the year. Spielberg has crafted a real classic.
8485	4	a	There are fragments of good comedy packed amidst the many forgettable scenes that you've seen a dozen times before in a dozen other forgettable comedies
8486	3	a	Fast-paced and highly watchable.
8487	6	a	Nothing in this story is remotely realistic, and the target audience for urban dramas -- teenage boys -- won't know what to make of its mushy romantic center.
8488	4	a	It leaves one with the impression of a human race so violent it justifies all the fears critics have expressed about potential modern-day reactions to the film.
8489	1	a	...a showcase for two actors who deserve long careers ahead of them.
8490	6	a	National Security just isn't good enough to be buoyed by Lawrence and an above-average script
8491	1	a	If you like Pixar or comic book movies, then The Incredibles is required viewing for you.
8492	5	a	Nothing more than an old-fashioned, family-friendly tearjerker that's good-natured but not very successful at strumming the heartstrings, which is what it obviously wants to do.
8493	0	a	Like waves in the ocean, you have to let this stuff flow over you, man. The film is fuzzy. It's not going to give all it can give on first watch, and for many that will be annoying as hell....One of the best films of the year
8494	8	a	Menashe Lustig's performance here is strong, in a subtly understated way, and there are a few - but very few - mildly emotionally resonant scenes. 
8495	2	a	A pleasant and sincere straightforward gay love story that is captivating and tender even if soppy in spots.
8496	6	a	"Country Strong"" is a title that calls to mind a pickup truck. Only in a work of science-fiction would it suffice as a description of Gwyneth Paltrow."
8497	4	a	My Big Fat Greek Wedding may not exactly be an innovative film, but it most certainly is a lovable one.
8498	2	a	Delivers a few pleasant surprises, including a smart story -- a reverse-E.T. riff that plops an American astronaut down in a world of just-like-us-only-green creatures -- and clever characters...
8499	1	a	Selma is a true triumph; a vitally important film with a legacy destined to endure.
8500	6	a	Into the Blue is a fine-looking, often boring, eye candy palace to visit. Until the languid turquoise sea churns into a crimson tide, that is. 
8501	4	a	"It's about cars, girls and fighting and doesn't pretend to be anything else. For sheer gall alone, ""Fast Five"" provides much entertainment. Just not much intellect."
8502	1	a	What sets this kid comedy apart is how well it resists the temptation to clobber the bullies and crown the underdog.
8503	3	a	It feels like you have spent an hour and a half watching puppy dogs and rainbows. 
8504	3	a	If you can find a better time at the movies this year than this wild comic thriller, let me in on it. I'm there.
8505	4	a	Hancock suggests the Colin Powell 'Pottery Barn' argument, but before it gets really interesting, veers wildly off course.
8506	6	a	In You, Me and Dupree, Owen Wilson plays a freeloading houseguest who wears out his welcome after one day. The film wears out its welcome considerably sooner than that.
8507	5	a	So do you think the war on terror is one big joke? ... Even if you do, this is comedy that, for all its heavy-handed political satire, just isn't funny.
8508	6	a	For the few jokes that work and the team-up of Ted, Wahlberg and Seyfried, this follow-up is worth a look but only if you loved the original.
8509	4	a	The film's many stunts are exciting, well-staged and cleverly shot to this layman's eyes, though climbers might nitpick the probabilities of some of the actions.
8510	0	a	Carol is a n excellent film, full of warmth and romance.
8511	3	a	There are plenty of laughs and a host of memorable songs crooned by everyone from Miss Piggy to Statler and Waldorf.
8512	6	a	We now know 'Spanglish' wasn't a fluke. Writer/director Brooks' artistic decline continues with How Do You Know
8513	2	a	Simultaneously scattered and thought-provoking, as if writer/director David O. Russell gathered up all his loose ideas and decided to pack them tightly into one movie.
8514	3	a	It traces the vanishing of middle American small towns and the importance of having a dream, even if it's a goofy one.
8515	1	a	Hypnotic at times, masterfully evoking locations and blurred headspace through precise imagery -- pure silver screen math. Fincher respects the clue-gobbling tonality of the story, but he also keeps his directorial fingerprint fresh.
8516	9	a	Jane Got a Gun manages to tell a modest - you might say highly inconsequential - yarn that's not even lightly spiced with ideas, circumspection, interesting characters or basic logic. It's a film that just... happens.
8517	4	a	Works enough within its own rules, its own container, but blunts its own real-world impact along the way.
8518	6	a	This lack of effort creates the impression that this is a generic work, a high-school drama with science-fiction touches screened on Sunday evenings on cable television.
8519	3	a	McAbee deserves much credit for not letting the obvious financial limitations constrain his imagination.
8520	1	a	A joy ride of a film that evades the self-consciousness that stalls so many other recent comic-book adaptations, it is one of the best superhero movies ever.
8521	3	a	a solid genre story, and Jackson makes all that much better by his mere presence.
8522	4	a	Jurassic Park III ultimately falls right in line with its immediate predecessor...
8523	2	a	In an obvious nod to modern times, today's Alfie merely explores his lack of commitment. The result is entertaining, but in a more superficial, less meaningful way.
8524	2	a	Aardman's secret weapon is the textural warmth of the claymation medium. While stop-motion animation is as slow and exacting an art form as you can get, one still has the sense that the filmmakers are engaged in child's play at a kitchen table. 
8525	2	a	What's pretty amazing here is that Hanson has managed to take Scott Silver's lameass script and mediocre acting and turn it into something special.
8526	6	a	Lowbrow, vulgar, and certainly formulaic, it's also creative, absolutely hilarious, and ... knows better than to shoot over its audience's heads.
8527	5	a	A pseudo-bio pic that is little more than a vehicle to shock and tittilate.
8528	6	a	Director/co-star Jackie Earle Haley and his cast serve up a solid slice of Tarantino-lite. But the script unravels with weak third act and over-explained finale. 
8529	4	a	I always look forward to watching director Cameron Crowe's films or should I say listen to his superior soundtracks. For this former Rolling Stone journalist, music and movies were simply born to run. 
8530	3	a	Incredibly entertaining even without knowledge of Nosferatu.
8531	5	a	The movie just flails away at a lot of plot points that are either second-hand playground hustles straight out of White Man Can't Jump -- or second-rate.
8532	4	a	One of the better efforts to come out of the Mouse House's traditional animation departments in recent years.
8533	4	a	Matthew Broderick shows his versatility and might as an actor here
8534	5	a	Cute kids. Harried fathers. Wise, understanding mothers. Some stupid pet tricks. A little girl falls in love. Over-protective father messes things up. Money isn't everything. Tender moments. And lots of pratfalls.
8535	3	a	[Black's] script is irreverent one moment and cold-blooded the next.
8536	4	a	Costner holds it all together. While he's always been supremely watchable, as his looks succumb to middle-age spread-his acting chops have escalated.
8537	1	a	It's a great day in America when the complicated looks so easy, and when we expect smart storytelling as a rule, not the exception.
8538	2	a	It's refreshing to see a movie aspire to a little more than just raiding the cliche bin.
8539	2	a	Miami Vice, as entertaining as some of it is, is so cool that it's almost too cool. It takes the sin, and much of the juice, out of vice.
8540	0	a	Shoeshine's tragedy evolves from the overall environment and system as much as it does from the individual choices the boys make.
8541	4	a	For the record, my eight-year-old son gave it five stars.
8542	5	a	While it's not entirely lacking in sharp dialogue, Kasdan's movie is weirdly unwieldy and... a bit blinkered.
8543	0	a	Against the whisper of wind and buzz of flies, the Coens manage to find tension in the subtlest of movements and cut the dialogue through with humour as arid as the landscape.
8544	4	a	Heroin, as it turns out, provides the characters in Trainspotting with something the filmmakers can't -- motivation. Without the drug, Boyle can't convincingly explain the actions of Renton and his friends.
8545	1	a	Eminem proves himself on the big screen with this extremely well-made film loosely based on his own life in innercity Detroit.
8546	4	a	Thoughtful and well-acted, but a little flat in the story department.
8547	5	a	Look, I love dogs. But this film tried my patience almost beyond endurance.
8548	3	a	Youth and death meet again in Gus Van Sant's Paranoid Park, a gorgeously stark, mesmerizingly elliptical story told in the same lyrical-prosaic style that has characterized his latest films.
8549	0	a	Kids who watch this movie can never know how revolutionary it was.
8550	9	a	The movie annoyed me on many levels.
8551	7	a	Any minute now, it'll stand up and pull off its mask and voice chip and be revealed for what it truly is: a rejected Bond script.
8552	4	a	Ralph Breaks the Internet [is] a perfectly decent animated film that, to its credit, critiques its title character, despite being unable to transcend a profound sense that we've seen this all before.
8553	3	a	Maybe it stretches the point a little far, but it's still entertaining to sit through, beautiful to look at, and stimulating to think about.
8554	4	a	It's filled with literally explosive excitement. 
8555	5	a	A perplexing blend of threadbare narrative tropes assembled without any imagination or, crucially, any fun.
8556	3	a	If it sounds a bit ponderous, well, maybe it is, but it's also smart, warm-hearted and sumptuously shot.
8557	2	a	The entire cast -- including Dennis Quaid and Mandy Moore -- is pitch-perfect, nailing hilarious one-liners with shades of irony.
8558	1	a	"Combines enough that's genre-friendly and accessible with the trademark style of a truly unique and ""artsy"" filmmaker."
8559	6	a	"American Pastoral"" is a pale imitation of the real thing - pastrami without mustard, briskets without onions, life without guilt. It's so busy trying to provide answers it forgets the questions are the most important thing of all."
8560	1	a	Pedro Almodovar's The Skin I Live In, a terrific, twisty thriller that is one of the filmmaker's best and one of the year's best films.
8561	6	a	It's all kitsch and no substance.
8562	3	a	Early Man does not reinvent the wheel, but leave it to the stop-motion pioneers at Aardman Animations to take a potentially tired storyline and jolt it awake with good-natured humor and subversive social commentary.
8563	6	a	Foster is believable, but casting her is like entering a Maserati in the soapbox derby.
8564	2	a	Though it goes a bit wonky toward the end and seems to travel a very long way to drive home a rather simple point, Wristcutters: A Love Story remains a wonderfully evocative experience.
8565	3	a	The film is about people trying to live good lives and that is ultimately a serious and worthwhile subject. Into The Wild is one of the best films of the year.
8566	5	a	Dumb is one thing, but this sorry attempt at action-comedy from stuntman turned director Steve Boyum is in an intelligence-deprived class all its own.
8567	2	a	Ordinarily, Linney plays annoying characters. This one is a lot less annoying than most of them.
8568	4	a	Up until about the halfway mark of this movie, I was having a very good time. Then, somehow, it ran out of energy.
8569	3	a	"Dominion"" isn't outright horror, and a welcome relief from the days where shots are shorter than the hairs on our heads."
8570	2	a	The usually comic Ed Helms does credible work as the moral voice in reliving a piece of sensational history that likely never will reveal the indisputable truth.
8571	8	a	Feebly crafted in virtually every way imaginable -- directing, cinematography, acting, scriptwriting.
8572	4	a	Lee has gone for shaggy comedy. Some of it is funny. Some of it just sits there.
8573	4	a	Smith carries it off with his effortless charm and confidence, whether he's chatting up a woman, conspiring with the audience, or instructing a client, and director Andy Tennant gives it a light gloss and an easy lilt.
8574	0	a	With its spirit of visual and narrative innovation, and Welles's precocious, towering central performance, Citizen Kane almost lives up to its own reputation as the best of all time.
8575	6	a	What could have been the brilliant set-up to an ongoing franchise is instead turned into a vacuous slice of summer escapism.
8576	0	a	A somber evocation of a poor, close-knit section of Boston on the brink of moral collapse.
8577	0	a	It is the classic film [by] Lucas, Spielberg...back before they were replaced by automatons put here by aliens.
8578	4	a	Surprisingly good-natured and harmless.
8579	8	a	A more appropriate title would be Who Cares What You Did Last Summer.
8580	8	a	Newcomer director Laurence Dunmore does not show the experience necessary to pull off this period piece and lets Depp's performance fall by the wayside
8581	4	a	Snakes was the best instantly disposable cinematic event I've attended since Bride of Chucky was launched on an unsuspecting world eight years ago.
8582	3	a	I, Robot is less compelling as a drama of the human enslavement of androids than it is an intriguing vision of a treeless, cashless future.
8583	4	a	Alpha and Omega proves that sometimes more is more and less is less for a reason.
8584	3	a	Bruce Dern is back and better than ever, playing a stubborn-as-a-mule senior citizen hell bent on a fool-hearty mission in the bittersweet road movie, Nebraska. Affectionate and heart-warming, this is an absolute joy.
8585	3	a	Taking Woodstock is enormous fun.
8586	1	a	This is a film that starts out funny and ratchets up the insanity.
8587	5	a	More standard programmer than action blockbuster, a remake that may not be offensive but is basically unnecessary.
8588	4	a	Man of the Year makes telling points and has a lot to say, but it loses its voice along with its consistency around the mid-way point, and that will likely make it an also-ran in the box office race.
8589	2	a	Kind hearts, good laughs, and a conclusion that almost makes you glad you sat through one of the most insufferable first acts in movie history.
8590	3	a	The behind the scenes record of the event is fascinating, both in terms of the mechanics of successfully creating such a massive enterprise and in the personalities involved.
8591	3	a	Just the sort of rom-com you'd expect from a director who once came to blows with George Clooney.
8592	4	a	There are worse ways to spend a couple of hours. Set in some stunning locales in Italy, Letters is a guilty pleasure that's lighter on the guilt and heavier on the pleasure.
8593	4	a	It's all weird. It's often humourous. It can be a tad precious but it's mostly very engaging.
8594	1	a	Pro football fans may be disillusioned by this excellent, honest, and often brutal expose of the play-for-pay game.
8595	6	a	Why should we care about Edie Sedgwick? Factory Girl, fatally, can't find a reason.
8596	4	a	This offers a mystifying look at the future with a mind-bending twist.
8597	3	a	The director wants to bring recent history to life for people who weren't around to witness it, and in that he succeeds pretty admirably.
8598	6	a	A harmless, inoffensive bit of family programming during the holiday season -- and there's nothing wrong with that. But 'harmless' doesn't have to mean dull.
8599	3	a	One of the most gorgeous Disney films ever.
8600	9	a	Unfortunately, the adolescent world created within the film extends to its conception.
8601	3	a	Wonderland is fast and frenetic and so unvarnished that it can make you feel unclean watching it.
8602	4	a	It's big, loud, dumb, over-the-top and mostly substanceless. But it works, perhaps better than ever before. 
8603	3	a	It captures how even when sex gets this purposeful, it's in a different way for girls than for boys.
8604	0	a	I hope that Pauline at the Beach will win new admirers for Mr. Rohmer, one of the most original and elegant film makers at work today in any country.
8605	0	a	Pi is like a Cronenberg film of the mind, where the unsettling images and lusts are driven by a desire for knowledge, not flesh.
8606	1	a	Cube is one of those rare films that make you itch uncomfortably on the inside.
8607	4	a	First Reformed ends up feeling like a film that needed another draft or two to help iron out the wrinkles in its main character's arc.
8608	4	a	"It's a movie every bit as messy as its ""hunny""-craving bear, though only somewhat as lovable. "
8609	2	a	In one of his last films films to be released, the late Philip Seymore Hoffman gives another of his pitch-perfect performances in this twisted spy yarn set in Hamburg, Germany.
8610	2	a	It has some very funny moments, and a few touching ones as well. Sure, it gets corny at times, but overall, it's a very entertaining movie that can appeal to a broad audience.
8611	10	a	The scary part is that a sequel was made.
8612	3	a	A well-made, slightly old-fashioned adventure with a few fantasy elements and a modern, ironic sense of humor.
8613	3	a	Even if it needed one last push to make it truly exceptional, there's a lot to enjoy here. And Soderbergh once again attracts a cast it's a pleasure to spend time with.
8614	2	a	It's an old story, but Coach Carter makes it urgent, insightful and inspirational.
8615	3	a	Spaceballs meets the Six Clueless Samurai.
8616	5	a	"I've heard this film described as a ""John Hughes"" - type film. Barely. Though Hughes did spend a lot of his time writing about teenagers, their problems and how they dealt with them, his characters were a hell of a lot more believable."
8617	6	a	Without the talent of Bob Hope this picture would be one dull thud.
8618	3	a	Passion affords exactly the moviegoing experience Gibson intended: an appreciation of Christ's sacrifice via an explicit rendering of his suffering.
8619	3	a	Snakes on a Plane is good fun that could have been great fun.
8620	9	a	Derivative dystopia is a muddled, maudlin and laughable mess with a few nice fight scenes to break up the failure.
8621	3	a	The World's End is pretty blasted funny and a fine finale to director/cowriter Edgar Wright and star/cowriter Simon Pegg's so-called 'Cornetto Trilogy.'
8622	6	a	Sentimentality as thick and sticky-sweet as Winnie the Pooh's beloved honey coats Christopher Robin, a paean to your inner child that's so cloying it may tempt you to strangle yours.
8623	3	a	This 'haven't we seen this before?' sensibility is anything but a downside. It's the draw of director Julian Jarrold's good-looking, entirely pleasant revel.
8624	8	a	It appears as though Mankiewicz wanted to conduct his own triumphant slapstick symphony with Delirious. He just brought the wrong sheet music to share with his cast.
8625	6	a	Jumbling frat-house humor with nostalgic period sets and costumes is like writing a punchline to a Frederic Remington painting. Only less hilarious.
8626	2	a	It is a most demanding, original work and one must meet it on its own terms, without expectations of casual pleasures.
8627	4	a	... a script with a social agenda nearly undermines all the film had going for it...
8628	3	a	The absolute highlight: the return of Andy Serkis, master of motion-capture performance, as the scary, disturbing, pathetic Gollum.
8629	1	a	Stiller is brilliant.
8630	9	a	An excruciating, unendurable stinker from first frame to last.
8631	1	a	"At times, ""Hello, My Name is Doris"" can feel too real, too raw... but it demonstrates the power of decency, kindness, owning up to things, and confronting your own issues."
8632	0	a	It's an amazing story.
8633	6	a	The script might be the worst in the entire franchise, but a talented cast and some exciting interludes during the first half slightly compensate for the rampant idiocy.
8634	5	a	Despite the presence of four credited screenwriters, the plot is a rehash of cliches and tired jokes.
8635	9	a	Amateurish drivel, which is headed for Skinemax in a hurry.
8636	4	a	After prompting us to seriously ponder life's ultimate question, Eastwood's final answer seems to be: Don't worry about it.
8637	4	a	That Theron rises to the challenge is remarkable; the challenge for audiences will be to avoid confusing a great performance with a great movie.
8638	6	a	I expected this movie to be better.
8639	3	a	Part Western, part meditation on what it means to be a man, part elegy for a way of life.
8640	9	a	"It's titled ""The Last Witch Hunter"" for goodness' sake. Fantasy fearlessness shouldn't be this boring."
8641	2	a	...if you liked the old Addams Family on television, you're sure to love them at least as much on film.
8642	6	a	The last fifteen minutes is pretty good but that end does not justify the earlier means.
8643	7	a	John Singleton's follow-up to his stunning debut, Boys N the Hood, is a major disappointment--a sophomore jinx.
8644	3	a	Emotionally rewarding, imaginatively detailed and made with a genuine sense of joy, the first Hobbit chapter succeeds despite its structural and formatting mis-steps.
8645	9	a	Trafficking in irresponsible inferences and unsupported conclusions, the filmmaker Brent Leung offers himself as suave docent through a globe-trotting pseudo-investigation that should raise the hackles of anyone with even a glancing knowledge of the basic
8646	5	a	Ribisi embarrasses himself by making Elliott sound like Hannibal Lecter, Flight of the Phoenix reminds you why The Aviator or Spanglish are so good.
8647	10	a	This spaceship misfire manages to be overblown and undernourished at the same time.
8648	5	a	Explain to me why the big studios keep making romantic comedies which are so lacking in romance and comedy.
8649	5	a	If you can claw your way through some ugly material and shoddy direction, there are some good messages here that can be warmly received.
8650	2	a	A fun-filled, feel-good journey...
8651	3	a	At times the film's themes are tired, but Greenwald's eye for atmosphere and fine musical performances more than compensate.
8652	4	a	The visuals take a while to get used but soon emerge as sharp and clean as the film's thoughtful political message.
8653	3	a	Deals with emotionally charged material, so it should surprise no one that it includes one of the most wrenching moments ever captured on film.
8654	5	a	The film itself just isn't very engaging, in part because Portman is so frustratingly passive for much of it.
8655	1	a	The sight of William H. Macy sporting a Jew-fro as a divorced dad trying to help his nerdy son score with a prom date is among the myriad delights in the gut-bustingly funny Bart Got a Room.
8656	2	a	All the things that made the first film a hit with its target audience.
8657	3	a	A thriller with a brain, a grown up film for grown ups
8658	0	a	It really is filmmaking at the highest pitch of intelligence: a work teeming with skill both cinematographically and dramaturgically. 
8659	6	a	Leaves us to admire the technique and the music without giving us much more to care about.
8660	1	a	Their camaraderie and the heated arguments capture the essence of the personalities and issues. . .in a large and impressive ensemble of African-American character actors.
8661	3	a	[Kore-eda] captures small interactions beautifully, and builds up a layered portrait of the main characters' everyday lives in those meaningful gestures and exchanges.
8662	5	a	A long, snarky, borderline disdainful parody that's also an inferior imitation of the movies it mocks. No, thank you.
8663	6	a	Even the considerable talents of Elijah Wood and Michael Caine cannot make this any more than another flick in which biceps give black magic a beatdown.
8664	4	a	Sporadically, but hilariously, funny. Goldthwait is great as the alcoholic, mime-hatin' clown.
8665	1	a	Why, Joel and Ethan, why did you have to ruin an almost flawless film with a terrible last scene?
8666	3	a	a perfect date movie, with a nice blend of romance and light-hearted comedy
8667	4	a	For all of its comedic nosedives, the film is frank and uncompromising as a study of the final weeks of a relationship.
8668	3	a	God, sex and the blues are mashed together and deep fried southern style in Craig Brewer's unique Black Snake Moan. 
8669	5	a	The film suffers due to Pegg's wearying, laddish performance, which comes off as simply obnoxious: Imagine Jim Carrey at his most manic, throwing his arms out wide as if appealing directly to the audience for a laugh.
8670	0	a	By far, one of the best films of the year.
8671	6	a	"Comedy is certainly subjective, but as a fan of MacFarlane's other work I found ""A Million Ways to Die in the West"" a comedy misfire."
8672	2	a	The strong against-type performances of Annette Bening, Naomi Watts, and Samuel Jackson help an absorbing if very uneven script. 
8673	2	a	An enjoyable vehicle for its two stars -- and the maturing Haley Joel Osment.
8674	3	a	When it hooks into the filmgoer, the mix of classic thriller tones and Singer's invigorating compositional rhythms brings Valkyrie to an impressive boil.
8675	6	a	If only Jane's fictional life had half the wit as what she put on the page.
8676	4	a	Like a beautifully wrapped gift that fails to impress once the box is opened, Memoirs of a Geisha is gorgeous to look at - - but that's about it.
8677	6	a	Feels like six different movies fighting each other for attention.
8678	6	a	Any way you slice it, I, Frankenstein is quite a few stitches shy of the classic monster.
8679	6	a	Only in filmmaking does one very good idea plus another very good idea sometimes add up to one less-than-great picture.
8680	3	a	There's loads of eye candy, but nothing that's terribly engaging. It's not bad, but no classic.
8681	4	a	When the fire burns out, we've only come face-to-face with a couple dragons and that's where the film ultimately fails.
8682	2	a	Stallone more than holds his own against an all-star ensemble cast; indeed, he soundly anchors the picture.
8683	4	a	This is a purely cathartic, visceral experience, not having anything to do with characters or plot.
8684	3	a	...an erratically-paced yet stirring drama that benefits greatly from McQueen's mere presence...
8685	1	a	The vignettes have the pleasant cumulative effect of making us slow down to smell the coffee.
8686	4	a	I like everything about Paper Towns except for its premise and central romance. Yes, I know those sort of seem like dealbreakers, but the things I liked about Paper Towns marginally outweighed the things I didn't like. Marginally.
8687	2	a	Watts holds our attention and sympathy, even when the plot floats into the ether.
8688	2	a	They'll always have Tokyo.
8689	3	a	Click to read review
8690	5	a	Though daling with a relevant issue, James L. Brooks' new serio comedy suffers from uneven writing, tentative approach to narrative and characters, hesitancy about specific ending, and slow pacing.
8691	5	a	By the end of the film, the sly cleverness of the opening scenes is a distant memory, supplanted by a heaping dose of heavyhanded melodrama.
8692	0	a	This is a suspense classic that leaves teeth-marks.
8693	4	a	[Law's] timeless good looks and effortless charisma make him the kind of leading man that Hollywood would produce from genetic experiments if they could.
8694	2	a	This is not Eastwood's finest film, but its still a well made and moving film, and a fascinating and true story.
8695	9	a	What graphic sex is to the use of the body in hardcore porno, graphic violence is to destruction of the body of Christ in this Passion.
8696	4	a	Lots of Fun, Lots of thrills
8697	5	a	One central recasting and brutal editorial session away from being a lovely little short film, where its mystery and sentiment is more easily controlled and considered. 
8698	1	a	Into the Wild is a bittersweet odyssey of opportunities lost and paradise found.
8699	4	a	Frequently riotously funny stuff, playful, silly, and fun. And all without Styrofoam boulders, to boot.
8700	6	a	Would someone please write a movie good enough for Timothy Olyphant? A Perfect Getaway sure isn't it.
8701	7	a	... full of praise for God in place of foul language and biblical quotes in place of deeds. It preaches to the converted -- literally.
8702	4	a	Kline gives a wild, wonderful performance, reminiscent of his work on A Fish Called Wanda.
8703	2	a	Definitely for mature audiences as there were no car chases or explosions. Hanks and Roberts still have chemistry together, and there is always that fantastic Roberts laugh.
8704	4	a	The end result may look good but it never feels distinctive despite the wealth of talent involved in front of and behind the camera.
8705	4	a	Made primarily for those who already know why Fred Lebow deserves his own documentary, this biography of the New York City Marathon founder isn't quite compelling enough to draw couch potatoes from their living rooms.
8706	4	a	Well-acted, satisfactory remake that replicates the creepy atmosphere of the original and, for some reason, throws in a whole bunch of extra stuff involving horses...
8707	4	a	Pretty stars in exotic settings with a hint of excitement and an air of mystery. Ah, Salt by Chanel.
8708	7	a	"Wow. Just wow. Moore should stick to the ""non-fiction"" world."
8709	6	a	"No amount of feints will change one fact: ""Bleed for This"" has no new moves."
8710	6	a	Like the main character, the movie is okay at first but eventually wears out its welcome.
8711	3	a	The message is equality and acceptance and it comes through by refusing to conform to archaic ideas of what a gay man should be.
8712	4	a	A middling showcase for rising star Aubrey Plaza.
8713	5	a	Aaron Eckhart tries his best but he can't breathe life into this monster of a movie.
8714	0	a	A meaty uncompromising movie from the masterful Sam Peckinpah.
8715	3	a	It's a thrilling ride...[but] this bountiful pot of signifiers leaves a caustic aftertaste. 
8716	3	a	It's sophisticated look is rich with details that are easy to take for granted, but which add immeasurably to the texture and dimension of the scenes.
8717	3	a	Linear storytelling was never Herzog's strong suit even under the best of conditions. His strength lies in capturing lucid lunacy on film, and Manoel da Silva's descent into the jaws of madness is a straight shot into the heart of darkness.
8718	1	a	The World's End is gruesomely gooey and wonderfully clever without skimping on real three-dimensional characters.
8719	5	a	Singularly fails to charm - and even Murray's on faltering form.
8720	2	a	Because of its outre subject of lesbianism and one sexually graphic scene, Aldrich's well acted, lurid melodrama was slapped with X-rating upon its release.
8721	5	a	Might as well be titled: James Cameron: What I Did On My Holidays.
8722	5	a	So so attempt to combine two generations of Star Trek crews.
8723	3	a	Throbs as a tale of good people wanting to right wrongs with the truth if possible, and violence if necessary.
8724	1	a	"The Savages does a good job keeping things in perspective by pointing out the ""what can you do?"" absurdity of it all. We all face mortality, and we can all laugh at it too."
8725	7	a	Gets Bond back to the basics: bullets, babes, big-time bad guys and bawdy humor.
8726	4	a	So stylish that no one seems able to bring themselves to say exactly what's happening.
8727	9	a	All told, a fairly shameful enterprise, displaying a breathtaking paucity of imagination.
8728	2	a	Though the subplot of Doris' hoarding jumps between hilarious and depressing too jarringly at times, Field nails the anxiety of an overwhelmed senior when a single pencil is moved from its usual place.
8729	3	a	The spine of the story has been entrusted to Robert Downey Jr. and Jamie Foxx, who make all their moments in The Soloist count.
8730	6	a	A trip to the bottom of the sea that has no real purpose save to flog the wreck of the Titanic, Cameron's cash cow.
8731	5	a	Unfortunately, the funny side of the film is abandoned quickly, and the muddled plot disappears bubblingly into the lagoon.
8732	3	a	"The scarcity of expository background took me a few minutes to adjust to. But part of ""The Rover's"" mission is to keep us off-kilter; making us question and seek out answers about what's happened before."
8733	5	a	Paris Can Wait simply flickers away inoffensively in the background. It's just there.
8734	3	a	Crackling dialogue, surprising intelligence and an emotional wallop.
8735	3	a	Superior thriller from before Edwards' typecasting as a comedy specialist.
8736	0	a	Hazanavicius boldly strips cinema back to its wordless, monochrome days and, boy, does the end result sparkle.
8737	5	a	There really doesn't seem to be any reason for this listless Chipmunks installment - the fourth in their continuing big-screen revival, if you're counting.
8738	10	a	Excruciatingly unfunny...an astonishingly awful movie.
8739	2	a	A stirring addition to the James Bond franchise.
8740	3	a	A smart, snappy upgrade doesn't tarnish memories of a childhood favourite.
8741	5	a	All of the added humor, though, does not make Bride of Chucky a good film--just a campy one.
8742	3	a	Theron sacrifices her body, her image, and her soul to give what may be the most stunning transformation ever to take place in any movie.
8743	10	a	The makers of this shameful waste of celluloid have padded their work with fat jokes, homophobic jokes, gratuitous nudity and various bodily functions, while harboring a fundamental hatred for women.
8744	9	a	As broad as Williams goes in these scenes, it's not really his fault. He's acting out a screenplay, credited to Daniel Taplitz, that's peppered with bad writerly flourishes.
8745	6	a	If you're searching for a treasure, look elsewhere.
8746	4	a	Wonderfully shot and convincingly acted, the picture shows what it takes to survive physically but struggles to get under the characters' skins psychologically.
8747	2	a	Mother and Child reminds us how important the notion of lineage - of finding a discernible path through life that doesn't just begin and end with ourselves - is to our personal identity, and the decisions we make in life.
8748	9	a	One sad sad spoof that I could have lived without.
8749	4	a	Good voice talent and some funny moments.
8750	4	a	Don't hold your breath, or your heart: it's not exactly Brief Encounter. But Ardant has the moves. It's the younger cast members who must struggle to keep up.
8751	0	a	A hilarious family values flick which manages to convince you that it's possible to transform a misogynist into a doting father on the guilt of an unplanned pregnancy.
8752	7	a	An interesting failure
8753	5	a	Conceptually, there's something to both Paradox and the overall loosely-connected Cloverfield universe. Unfortunately, the bulk of the movie's runtime fails to capitalize on virtually any of that promise. 
8754	4	a	Project Nim introduces quite an extraordinary tale of woe from a puzzling subject, but its aim is slightly off, diluting the final summation of a wholly troubling existence.
8755	3	a	"MacFarlane's ""Million Ways"" has an equal affinity for both the laughs and the Western landscape."
8756	3	a	It's in color, but it feel black-and-white, as washed-out as its hero is burnt-out.
8757	3	a	Making good use of its excellent premise, this flawed gem deserves to find an audience.
8758	3	a	DuVernay and Webb ambitiously dramatize all the intricacies, detours and compromises a wide-scale social justice movement entails, shining stark light on backroom deals, FBI schemes and even rivalries among various pockets of grass-roots rebellion. 
8759	3	a	Tyler is a find for a director like Bertolucci.
8760	4	a	The film feels like 'Classics Comics' instead of a classic.
8761	4	a	Italy has never looked better on screen than it does in Sayombhu's Mukdeeprom's cinematography...
8762	8	a	An unwieldy, unexciting feature that doesn't top what's come before, with Black the unlikely architect of the brand name's demise.
8763	4	a	In the Gospel According to Mel Gibson, blood doesn't lie. It's the only truth that exists. Which means the agony is the ecstacy in The Passion of the Christ.
8764	0	a	A fine piece of cinema that will hopefully be clutched by moviegoers for years to come.
8765	2	a	This won't run at the front of the movie pack but it has bite.
8766	6	a	Almost everything about The Joneses, from the transparent plot twists to the winking irony of the golf-course patter, falls flat.
8767	8	a	Raiders Of The Lost Ark was the first in the Indiana Jones trilogy, and it can be argued that it changed the course of filmmaking for the better part of a decade.
8768	4	a	In no ways is Broken Embraces a bad movie, but it certainly ranks low on Almodovar's list of brilliant films. That said, Almodovar at his worst is still genius.
8769	6	a	What is most surprising, however, is just how bad the basketball in the movie is. The games bookending the picture are two of the worst cinematic interpretations of the sport ever to grace the silver screen.
8770	2	a	This is a heady mix, but it sounds funnier than it plays, because it needed a Billy Wilder level of cynicism, and Weitz doesn't have anything like that.
8771	5	a	The story is naturally poignant, but first-time screenwriter Paul Pender overloads it with sugary bits of business.
8772	5	a	A well-meaning but bland picture that shortchanges its subject.
8773	4	a	Filled with cliches, a run-of-the-mill screenplay and the groan-inducing MTV Films formula.
8774	3	a	An adorable, original and thoroughly entertaining film that might just be the best movie for adults and children to see together since...well...since The Iron Giant.
8775	9	a	a visit to your local aquarium would make for a more interesting storyline, though the abs would probably not be as compelling
8776	9	a	A box office-driven sequel that re-hashes the already-tired approach and storyline of its predecessor.
8777	6	a	The movie is all anticlimax once we realize it's going to be about gimmicks, not characters.
8778	5	a	Larry Crowne is an amiable piece of fluff, but as a recession drama it lacks the bite of The Company Men, being too timid to criticise the forces that led to Larry's circumstances.
8779	5	a	It's a story of strength that crumples; a portrait of vitality that plays awfully flat.
8780	1	a	The film's overall energy and synth-scored kink is dizzying, especially in scenes of Yves waking up covered in snakes.
8781	4	a	The picture has two lingering scenes that are so excruciatingly funny they compensate for the material that flounders.
8782	2	a	This film is almost too real to be funny. It is one uncomfortable moment after another - and that is what Stiller does best, but director Roach would have done well to tone it down a bit.
8783	3	a	Kids will have nightmares for weeks and adults will be entertained for hours...
8784	2	a	A sweet and genial comedy with a relatively low cloy factor.
8785	4	a	This is a good addition to the female-centric movies we have seen of late. Here's hoping there will be more to come.
8786	4	a	"Strong off the starting line, it stalls before reaching the second reel due to a distinct lack of ""Diesel"" power."
8787	7	a	Sadly, as has consistently been the case with his recent film work, The Infiltrator gives Cranston basically nothing to do.
8788	5	a	Grodin's a fine foil and Steenburgen has some lovely, loopy bits, but their characters are handled mildly, almost naturalistically, and that spills onto Clifford, too. Which is deadly here.
8789	0	a	Spielberg has painted his masterpiece with his own blood.
8790	5	a	"There's a bizarrely Republican message, asserting that ""every woman has the exact love life she wants,"" which strikes me as kind of unsympathetic."
8791	4	a	What Astro Boy has in spades are energy, good humor, and the demolition-derby action of a superhero smash-up, reasons enough to recommend it to grade-school boys.
8792	1	a	It's the opposite of most films about drugs vs. life because it puts life up front.
8793	3	a	Sally Field gives a fabulous performance in quirky romcom.
8794	4	a	Sweet but predictible angst-ridden Brat Pack outing.
8795	4	a	This disappointing War of the Worlds limps to a conclusion that mercifully insures there will not be a sequel.
8796	1	a	Although each story is compelling, among the most heart-wrenching may be that of the Japanese-Irish couple who welcomed the new parish priest, who often slept over at their house, and who now feel responsible for letting the wolf in their door.
8797	3	a	Can a story on this scale function as compelling drama? I actually think that's what interests Eastwood the most here: the challenge of making historical figures move with the grace of remembered life.
8798	1	a	It is a fable, albeit a dark and twisted one destined to be praised by some, abhorred by others and turned into a cult classic by even more.
8799	1	a	The repeated references to nonviolence form an especially powerful theme, a reminder of what can be accomplished not through simply taking revenge, but by staying your hand.
8800	1	a	Credit must be paid to director Peter Berg for pulling off such a tricky balance of such diverse elements while delivering an impressive and affecting superhero adventure with as much heart and soul as sound and fury.
8801	4	a	While this atmospheric Australian Outback thriller has plenty of edgy action, it's also meandering and arty, refusing to fill in the details until filmmaker David Michod is good and ready.
8802	2	a	A zany indie sci-fi/comedy, that has a promising innovative premise about time travel.
8803	2	a	As a hangout movie for kids, My Neighbor Totoro pleases with its easygoing pace, curiosity about the natural world, and sweet spirit.
8804	10	a	It's stupefying in its dullness and vulgarity.
8805	5	a	This may be the worst movie to star two Oscar winners since the heyday of the studios when actors had no say in their projects.
8806	4	a	Faith-based pigskin tale.
8807	3	a	West respectably stretches beyond slam-bang action theatrics.
8808	3	a	It really is quite funny.
8809	2	a	Sausage Party is a gleeful ode to anarchy that transcends both stoner comedy and Pixar spoof.
8810	5	a	Life is a crock -- or something like it.
8811	2	a	A love letter to the great director that turns his effort to make 'Psycho' into...a David-and-Goliath story in which David is a creative giant himself.
8812	5	a	It's the second section that's really dire: a flaccid travelogue in which the boys visit landmark tourist attractions...these scenes bring the film to a grinding halt from which it never recovers.
8813	5	a	Nasty isn't necessarily a bad thing, there've been lots of really fun film that are nasty as hell, but this is just shock for shock's sake and is in the long run rather boring.
8814	2	a	American Dreamz is an often uproarious, always ambitious gutting of modern America that cuts painfully close to the truth from beginning to almost-end.
8815	3	a	Lost In Translation is a subtly moving movie that stays with you longer than you expect.
8816	1	a	a winning combination of wit, physical humor and bawdy sight gags.
8817	1	a	Not only did I love every silly, gothic, gorgeous minute of Guillermo del Toro's Crimson Peak, I'm actually suspicious of those who didn't.
8818	4	a	The performances are strong, and Glaudini pulls the story forward largely on the sweet image of an adult gladly taking baby steps into a new world.
8819	4	a	Little Man, featuring an adult little person posing as a toddler to steal a huge diamond, spits up a few lowbrow belly laughs. But not enough to go 'goo-goo, gaga' over. 
8820	9	a	Pointless movie.
8821	0	a	Fascinating in a creepy way.
8822	4	a	For people who like this sort of thing, this is just the sort of thing they like.
8823	6	a	The furtive figure history knows best as Watergate snitch Deep Throat gets a movie treatment more suited to the printed page than the big screen.
8824	3	a	A quasi-documentary about love that is sweet, true and perhaps a little deceptive.
8825	3	a	Wisely, [Greg] Berlanti leaves A-listers Jennifer Garner and Josh Duhamel in the background for most of the film and allows his young cast to carry the film in style - even though the ending is all a little too neatly wrapped. 
8826	1	a	Will Smith may be on the poster, and he may be the catalyst, but Kevin James is the star and heart and soul of this movie.
8827	3	a	Exciting chase with typically excellent Hitchcock touches
8828	3	a	Overall, Liman has done a good job of making this old Cold War thriller seem born again.
8829	3	a	The calendar may say that Summer is a few months away, but the escapist entertainment that the season is known for starts today with the release of this rocking thrill ride, one of the most purely enjoyable movies in a long time.
8830	0	a	Must-see Hitchcock thriller for any classic movie bug.
8831	6	a	Even with all the four-letter words, this still feels like immature kids' stuff.
8832	8	a	A cringingly self-aware, painfully verbose, and somewhat smug motion picture, Getaway is itching to keep audiences guessing, but it's far more successful at putting viewers to sleep.
8833	3	a	You have to admire the fact that, rather than turning to the safety of snark, this little movie sticks to its big idea: All you gotta do is believe.
8834	8	a	It soon becomes clear that they have planned their trip at a bad time; it is equally clear that every time is a bad time.
8835	3	a	It tells a grand, eloquent tale full of romance and melancholy.
8836	0	a	An exquisite film by Todd Haynes that delves into the lost arts and crafts of a raised eyebrow, a smouldering glance, a sharp intake of breath, a brush of a coral-polished fingernail, a pulse of expensive scent and looks that could thrill.
8837	4	a	It's formulaic but fun, a third-generation thrill-ride.
8838	4	a	Presents an appealing and persuasive picture of European integration, in which national differences, which once sparked military and political conflict, are preserved because they make life sexier and more interesting.
8839	5	a	A bland, faintly pointless slice of sentimentality, suggesting comedy isn't Lee's strong suit.
8840	7	a	The attempt of this B-film to be a convincing film noir never materializes...
8841	4	a	"This is the first feature from Crowe since the heavy-handed, overly quirky ""Elizabethtown,"" and while it's not a complete return to form, it's close enough."
8842	3	a	I can't get it out of my thoughts, and I recommend it highly.
8843	6	a	Specific bits of humor sometimes seem forced, and the film never balances its array of sex, laughs and violence.
8844	1	a	The Coens know how a thing or two about pacing, and it's relentless here. The story is full of unexpected twists and switchbacks, and opportunities for the audience to gear down and take a breath are few and far between.
8845	4	a	Bandslam is a mix of the icky, the corny and the comic, but there's no denying that it's fun.
8846	4	a	As it jumps from one song to the next, the flimsy plot and occasionally amusing one-liners move to a generic beat but there's enough energy in the musical numbers to deliver cheesy and diverting fun.
8847	2	a	A fascinating comment on the illusive and fetishistic nature of reality.
8848	1	a	...many of the best moments illustrate the experiences of [Timothy Chlamaet] in the solitary privacy of his room. [Full Review in Spanish] 
8849	1	a	Can't think of too many times a Hollywood version is so much superior to a European original.
8850	1	a	Burton's skewed vision is seamlessly realized by director Henry Selick and cleverly enhanced by Danny Elfman's songs.
8851	8	a	Idle Hands is either idiotic or pandering, when it isn't both.
8852	2	a	The photogenic, agile seals, in fact, steal the show from the biped actors, including even veteran David Carradine.
8853	7	a	A lackluster exercise in derivation almost completely free of fresh ideas.
8854	3	a	Jones' on-target portrayal of the dying athlete is mesmerizing.
8855	4	a	Make no mistake, this movie is trash, but it's meant to be, and I'd be lying if I said it wasn't also a lot of fun. 
8856	4	a	Funny in places but relentlessly crude.
8857	0	a	A haunting meditation on sexual politics, romantic love, and obsession, Vertigo is one of the greatest surreal movies ever made.
8858	2	a	The problem with the marital satire is that it goes on for too long, maybe like some marriages.
8859	3	a	Cianfrance makes intimate, psychologically penetrating films, with quiet spaces and moments of brutal intensity...As unlikely as the story is, Cianfrance deftly steers the material through elemental themes...
8860	3	a	Another Allen gem.
8861	3	a	Gorgeously designed and animated.
8862	0	a	A tenderhearted tale about two terribly wounded souls who survive by grudgingly leaning on each other's shoulder. 
8863	9	a	Michael Mann seems to have set out to extricate everything that made the show fun and original.
8864	4	a	Dickie Roberts is a lot funnier than it has any right to be... considering it's a David Spade comedy and counts Adam Sandler among its executive producers.
8865	2	a	The broken field running of the film's time line requires each viewer to reassemble the story in his head.
8866	1	a	Where the first film was the exposition, the follow-up is the reward - taking our heroes on a darker, more rewarding journey as we watch them deepen and mature with time.
8867	2	a	[It] impresses not just with the sheer weight of its actorly pedigree and length, but the wide, expressive gamut of emotions and lives that it puts on display.
8868	3	a	Black Or White is a good movie constantly fluctuating back and forth from clunky to complex. 
8869	1	a	A definite must-see that's perfect for a guys' night out or a relaxing date.
8870	0	a	An extremely tense exercise.
8871	2	a	Sausage Party is definitely not for everyone, but it offers an amusing blend of humor and substance, providing viewers with heady food for thought.
8872	3	a	A whodunit that keeps you guessing right to the end.
8873	6	a	'Angry Birds' never really takes flight. 
8874	8	a	A movie full of gestures that would look over-the-top in primary school plays.
8875	6	a	You'll probably laugh hard more than once; Sorority Rising is still rich in bikinis and bong rips and boner jokes. It just doesn't have much heart.
8876	6	a	If the idea of watching Martin Lawrence getting used and abused appeals to you, then Welcome Home Roscoe Jenkins is the movie for you.
8877	5	a	It's a toss-up as to who gets the worst end of the deal with Meet the Fockers: the audience or the film's all-star cast.
8878	5	a	Shallow characterisation, a script so laid-back you can almost hear it snoring and the occasional outburst of hokey dialogue lead to a movie a good deal less charming than it thinks it is.
8879	5	a	The story is inoffensively wholesome, and there may be enough goofy antics to engage young, indiscriminate viewers, but the level of creativity in the animation is serviceable at best.
8880	5	a	Jane Got a Gun is a slow fuse of a film that burns to a whimper instead of an explosion.
8881	2	a	More depth and clarity than expected.
8882	3	a	Slick entertainment that does its job, even if no one will remember it six years from now, much less six centuries.
8883	6	a	The wonderful character actors in the original ... are succeeded by a fairly anonymous bunch.
8884	4	a	There wasn't a moment in the film that I didn't enjoy, but neither was there anything that got my mind or heart racing.
8885	0	a	The screenplay for Matchstick Men is an achievement of Oscar calibre -- so absorbing that whenever it cuts away from 'the plot,' there is another, better plot to cut to.
8886	6	a	The biggest cause of the film's problems lies in the B story in which Amy's father, played by John Lithgow sporting a horrendous Australian accent, shows up trying to reconnect. 
8887	1	a	If it didn't star Julianne Moore, it would be well worth skipping. But the exceptional way Moore plays Alice, a renowned Columbia University linguistics professor with early-onset Alzheimer's, lifts the film above its morose potential.
8888	9	a	"The game ""Angry Birds,"" at its core, is a destination for switching off your brain. And movies, even throw-away summer animated kid films, should aim for something more."
8889	2	a	"Improbably, while Annette Bening is incredible playing a fading Hollywood starlet in Paul McGuigan's ""Film Stars Don't Die In Liverpool,"" it's her co-star, Jamie Bell, who might be the film's real secret weapon."
8890	4	a	You'd never find a backer for a rom-com with this little relationship anxiety now
8891	1	a	Smart escapist thrillers are a dying breed but this is one of the good ones.
8892	5	a	A brainless, forgettable thriller that quickly sinks without a trace, despite an attractive cast and gorgeous photography. 
8893	4	a	Average western.
8894	6	a	An exotic film that feels abbreviated.
8895	4	a	War of the Worlds is the kind of movie Spielberg can make in his sleep, which may be why it feels like we are sleepwalking while watching it.
8896	9	a	"Without a proper set-up and even a wisp of a payoff, ""The Darkest Minds"" becomes homework that's no fun to finish."
8897	1	a	Despite its hard-sell coming attraction and pot-smoking granny singing rock oldies, How to Make an American Quilt turns out to be a wealth of old-style Hollywood magic.
8898	6	a	Unforgivably slow and over-titled attempt to dramatize the ignoble murder of the notorious outlaw features a fine performance by Casey Affleck as Ford.
8899	6	a	An enjoyable campy bad film.
8900	2	a	Enchanted isn't just a culture-clash fable, it's also a throwback to one of classic Hollywood's giddiest genres: the screwball comedy.
8901	9	a	The Lazarus Effect does have one redeeming quality. It ends quickly.
8902	9	a	There is no punchline to this joke, just a great big question mark. Because it's confounding that anyone is still writing a movie like Humor Me, let alone wrangling uber-talented superstars like Clement and Gould into starring in it.
8903	8	a	With inspired performances and an even more inspiring story, this film is more than just a fantastic biopic about a great man; it is also a call to action. 
8904	4	a	even a toddler found it too uninteresting to stick around
8905	4	a	The chances of the movie being taken as seriously as other nature docs is fairly slim, because it tries way too hard to be cutesy and kid-friendly.
8906	4	a	Hereafter is worth taking seriously because, finally, it's about taking care to live decently -- not piously, or proudly, but honestly, in the here and now.
8907	10	a	Why, and at what point, did Feig choose to ally himself with the bullies of the world and substitute broad stereotype for insight into character?
8908	5	a	Ultimately it's a bit of a visually ugly clutter which leaves not so much with a bad taste in the mouth as a bland one. 
8909	4	a	Frantic working mom tale won't have much teen appeal.
8910	3	a	I can think of worse things to sit through than an orgy of bullets, exploding corpses, and stripper vampires.
8911	3	a	You won't regret seeing Invictus, but it will not become the captain of your soul.
8912	2	a	Even if you're not interested in the topic, I'd still recommend Ed Wood.
8913	5	a	It's a narrative of almost nothing interesting happening until the moment of crisis in the very last reel.
8914	4	a	The first Internet joke ever made into a movie, Snakes on a Plane is just ridiculous and depraved enough to excite a cult following among high campers who are ready to enlist in a movie that gets one over on Hollywood.
8915	9	a	The film is clearly an anti-racist warning, but Earl's silly, closed-minded anger is a major distraction from the comedy though most of the movie.
8916	3	a	"We Bought a Zoo"" provides a welcome seasonal dash of wholesomeness and humor, but it's also a heartening celebration of second acts, even at their most unwelcome."
8917	4	a	Ava DuVernay has pulled off a personal triumph by managing an engrossing film that serves up a chuck of history too many Americans don't know or have forgotten.
8918	4	a	Best enjoyed by nostalgic adults who fondly remember the stories, rather than little viewers who are discovering Pooh and friends for the first time.
8919	5	a	Lee frequently blocks the sheer fun of the project, which is the only element he has in his favor.
8920	5	a	Cinderella for Valley Girls
8921	6	a	It's not that the laughs aren't there, it's just that they're telegraphed.
8922	1	a	Where it could have descended into a revenge drama, it settles for justice instead -- and not the kind that puts down one's enemies, but the kind that calls for confession, even reconciliation.
8923	4	a	Sour and unsavory, rather than a black comedy, it's a bleak comedy.
8924	0	a	Like Elastigirl, Pixar shows it can be pulled in many directions and snap back into shape, invariably vanquishing any challenger that stands in the way.
8925	4	a	Paltrow's got the pipes, but Garrett Hedlund steals Country Strong out from under her.
8926	1	a	Suburban malaise has seldom been better looking or better acted.
8927	3	a	As cartoon sequels go, this ingenious romp is a game changer.
8928	0	a	The film's over two and half hours so go when you are in the mood to just escape into a fairy tale. Take a moment to search around the gorgeous sets and remember, a film like this doesn't get made these days. Wait, it does and it did.
8929	8	a	In its favor, the treasure-hunt adventure has some modestly good underwater scenes, complete with interesting fish. Still, a trip to the aquarium would probably be livelier.
8930	4	a	"If you want to see a first class perf by McDormand and a sexually titillating family story, then I think you might enjoy [""Laurel Canyon""]."
8931	6	a	In a movie about people who make their livings on misdirection, The Prestige utterly forgets to employ its own.
8932	2	a	Charm isn't a substitute for emotional nuance, but the trick pulled off here to justify the remake is Law's seductively engaging performance.
8933	4	a	Bleed For This features a pair of engaging turns from its two leads, that help to give it life where it desperately needs it, but the film itself is never quite able to feel as refreshing or courageous as Vinny Pazienza's real life story.
8934	3	a	It is a movie to closely watch and to savour; the confident direction and the flawless ensemble performances are, quite simply, worthy of Oscars.
8935	2	a	It is fascinating to spend time with this visualization of Burroughs's Mars/Barsoom.
8936	4	a	[Director] Derek Cianfrance's picture ends up overwrought and exhausting, but the performances of Fassbender, Vikander, and Rachel Weisz as the third person in the marriage, raise this handsomely shot picture to above average.
8937	6	a	Unfortunately, the house seems more alive than the characters in it - and not just the ghosts.
8938	4	a	"Bleed for This"" is not a very good movie, but it's an occasionally entertaining one."
8939	5	a	So pretty much does this Brooks misfire.
8940	7	a	It directs attention not to the internal reasons for America's economic problems, but to inscrutable, generalized, unknown others from abroad, whose yellow skins and strange manners announce their evil purposes as much as their unfair trade practices.
8941	6	a	... appeals neither to intellect, emotion nor sense of excitement.
8942	3	a	a script akin to a late night dorm room debate among college philosophy majors who enjoy the wacky tobacky, but it's a delightfully quirky and entertaining story
8943	3	a	Still one of Hollywood's most assured directors, Clint Eastwood transcends the story's cliches with a classically restrained yet steadily imaginative filmmaking style.
8944	6	a	This breach with the audience does matter, for it is one thing to seduce your viewers and quite another to trick them. Love is all about trust, after all.
8945	3	a	Great fun, brought to my attention by lovely people.
8946	7	a	Writer-director Stuart Beattie and his cast and crew tear into their bad idea with vigor.
8947	1	a	An absolutely merciless thriller--exciting, marvelously crafted, strongly acted, and with more than a few moments destined to increase your heartbeat.
8948	3	a	Surprisingly powerful.
8949	4	a	It's grim, bleak, uncomfortable and certainly no fun -- but performances are excellent and Shults' atmosphere of soul-corroding terror is hard to dismiss.
8950	3	a	Despite all this copycatting, the movie still has an interesting energy.
8951	3	a	How anyone could call Gibson's filmic account anti-Semitic is mindboggling in its confused narrow-mindedness.
8952	3	a	Whenever Cusack is on screen, the energy level of the movie just jumps up.
8953	6	a	As gorgeous as it is lifeless.
8954	5	a	There are only so many ways you can frame a bunch of hairy men and a token girl stumbling over the prow of a hill while moaning about being thirsty, before it gets boring.
8955	3	a	Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back is still one of the funnier comedies of the year.
8956	3	a	Menashe is the most human and humane of dramas.
8957	3	a	The gross-out factor is surprisingly low, and the combination of Stiller and De Niro is inspired: No father could be more formidable, no prospective son-in-law better equipped to squirm.
8958	2	a	It's the steadiness of The Rover that is its most defining feature, a sense that you're perambulating towards an inevitable showdown and just along for the ride.
8959	6	a	nothing we haven't seen before
8960	4	a	Lavish and lengthy, it has the spectacle and spirit of a Saturday matinee movie but not its fleetness or fun.
8961	6	a	Not only huge and unwieldy, but seemingly unsure of what it wants to do/say/prove.
8962	6	a	A melodramatic murder-mystery that is as uneven as its outcome is anticlimactic.
8963	1	a	The way it explores at length the sweet and sour aspects of first love is worth savoring.
8964	4	a	Has its moments, but not enough of them, and it ends up not saying much of anything.
8965	5	a	Barry Levinson's film, loosely inspired by the true story of reality TV show Afghan Star, comes at its subject matter from entirely the wrong direction.
8966	4	a	It ought to be easy to snark at this film, but the truth is it just left me feeling depressed. It's not how they do it that mystifies me, but why.
8967	8	a	Blade Runner has only gotten better with time. Do yourself a favor and pass over anything new in theaters and go for this old classic, it still has the power to dazzle and amaze.
8968	6	a	...a forgotten relic within Fox's spotty body of work. 
8969	4	a	There's much to like here but it's a bumpy ride and for all its banter, it takes itself very seriously. 
8970	4	a	Predictability damages Girls.
8971	4	a	Filmmaker Josh Mond is as interested in his hero's valleys as his...well, not peaks, but the moments when he's less agitated, even peaceful.
8972	0	a	You can feel the stillness and the heat of this sultry, sensual summer in Italy. This is a glorious romance about falling in love with life itself, and living with gusto.
8973	3	a	Offers the type of sweet, wholesome fun parents expect from the Disney brand but also with a few off-the-cuff jokes only parents will understand.
8974	6	a	Wasted is Foxx's genial charisma.
8975	4	a	Larry Crowne is nothing we haven't seen before and at times feels over-done and cliched.
8976	1	a	All of this is accomplished with wonderfully off-the-wall characterizations.
8977	5	a	Overly long and overstuffed, there's just not enough here for a recommendation.
8978	6	a	Jim Cummings brings the bear of little brain to life, and the heart cannot help but flutter in his presence.
8979	2	a	It was still fun despite its shortcomings.
8980	3	a	Our Little Sister does best in small, quiet moments.
8981	3	a	A little too genteel for my tastes. Or rather, it would be were it not for Paul Schneider's complex and often refreshingly rude performance.
8982	1	a	If you don't like the music, forget it. But, if you're like me, a Neil Young fan, this is great inside stuff.
8983	0	a	It gets no points for subtlety, but this confronting, devastating, hilarious and extremely fun film is a masterpiece all in its own right.
8984	6	a	Let's face it, Woody Allen makes some bad movies or at least only slightly entertaining movies. He might have been great in the past but that day has long gone.
8985	4	a	I have rarely laughed as hard as I did at this movie; however, I have also rarely been as ashamed of my laughter as I was here.
8986	6	a	The script... is a lumpy mess that mixes slapstick potty humor with ponderous father-son confrontation and reconciliation - neither of them staged effectively.
8987	5	a	A downbeat, claustrophobic study of problem-plagued mid-lifers living in a grungy New York that looks like a minimum security prison.
8988	9	a	This is a smug, pointless, cloth-eared, vanity project of a film.
8989	3	a	Borte's polished treatment of the material feels confidently in service of his point -- it's an assuredness that reminded me of David O. Russell -- and the actors involved commit to their situation wholeheartedly and entertainingly.
8990	5	a	The angst of dating, the struggle with children, and the joys of McDonalds.
8991	2	a	A fascinating, sensual drama about two stressed-out American businessmen who drop out of society and attempt to create their own hedonistic utopia. A thoughtful, little-known film worth seeking out.
8992	3	a	Spy Kids is one of the best kids' films to grace the silver screen in the last decade.
8993	4	a	"[""Take Care of My Cat""] is an honestly nice little film that takes us on an examination of young adult life in urban South Korea through the hearts and minds of the five principals."
8994	0	a	"But really, what makes ""Jurassic Park"" great is that it is a Steven-Spielberg-master-class in constructing action set-pieces. "
8995	2	a	...one of the most entertaining movies to have come out this summer. 
8996	5	a	Passable drama has great dancers but no originality.
8997	5	a	Tina Fey is the only thing preventing unmitigated disaster
8998	7	a	Same ol'
8999	1	a	Smart, romantic and thought provoking
9000	5	a	Law tries hard to make his Alfie likable, but he's working against the orchestrations of the narrative and merely comes off as feeble, a one-dimensional Eurotrash jerk with outmoded ideas about women and troubles that don't amount to a hill of beans.
9001	3	a	Jolie, in a role clearly designed for someone like Meg Ryan, shows us Lanie's vulnerability, inescurity, and her capacity for giddy joy. 
9002	5	a	"You too will find yourself saying, ""Better luck next time Chuck."
9003	4	a	... expecting more horror and less adventure.
9004	2	a	The film is at its best when it is in observational mode
9005	0	a	Lots of appeal for highly romantic teens.
9006	4	a	It plays like an urban western: a strong, quiet loner takes on a corrupt man who runs the town with the help of a girl gone wrong with a heart of gold.
9007	5	a	If well done, a film like Letters To Juliet should need no surprises. But it does need more than the postcard-ready vistas against which director Gary Winick frames much of the action.
9008	6	a	Florid and flawed, compressing Philip Roth's Pulitzer Prize-winning novel into tawdry melodrama.
9009	2	a	...a good, though not great, romantic comedy that entertains because of its stars. The story is a pedestrian boy meets girl, boy loses girl, boy gets girl yarn but the actors make it better. 
9010	4	a	The first hour of the film is a perfectly paced procedural that takes the cops from the gleaming streets of Miami to the ghettos of South America.
9011	4	a	War of the Worlds ends too abruptly, running out of juice just as the aliens do. Even on summer popcorn terms, it's a tepid finish to a movie that, for its first hour or so, taps so expertly into our fears.
9012	10	a	A movie to slit your wrist to.
9013	4	a	Flatly retells a high-concept Boy's Life adventure story that's hard to break, but easy to bleed of its significance.
9014	0	a	The chemistry between the leading men grows organically and it chronologically makes sense for the viewer. These characters take time to feel comfortable with each other and the film takes its time documenting it. 
9015	3	a	In Cruise's hands, von Stauffenberg comes off as a very human window into this history and this engrossing and involving movie.
9016	1	a	There is a melancholic grace and an emotive understanding to the ways in which friendships change and evolve over time, the continuous inventiveness of the film in that regard catching me by surprise.
9017	5	a	Helen Mirren's estimable talents are wasted in this soapy puddle, which is directed by her husband Taylor Hackford.
9018	6	a	Another painfully dull movie about an American in Europe hoping to capitalize on the looks and fame of its stars.
9019	5	a	Most of what made the book connect with so many is entirely missing here.
9020	6	a	A well-meaning trifle, earnestly performed but way too bland and vanilla to elicit much in the way of rooting interest or lasting memorability.
9021	4	a	Jane lacks a strong vision, doing justice to neither the camp potential of its title nor the sophistication of its structure. She's got a gun, all right, but it's shooting blanks.
9022	4	a	The date doctor operates like an overly eager comic intern. That's the only real glitch in Hitch. 
9023	1	a	There may be people who overlook the Arnold Schwarzenegger performance in Total Recall who think he isn't really acting. But the performance is one of the reasons the movie works so well.
9024	9	a	Yet another one of those films that Scream was supposed to have buried but instead resurrected.
9025	5	a	Shoddily written.
9026	6	a	As Hunt's life unravels, so does the movie, though the story maintains a certain baseline of interest just by virtue of being sordid.
9027	5	a	A senseless Hollywood comedy.
9028	3	a	There is a beating heart behind the glossy technical craft here, a real respect for the pop culture that so dictates everything about the film's universe.
9029	3	a	The cavalier attitude of the movie seems utterly unconcerned with whether or not the audience picks up on any of the jokes, all of which are delivered with an unaffected, deadpan style.
9030	7	a	Not nearly as stylish as the old TV series was, but just as vacuous in the narrative department...a retread that comes to the showroom already bald.
9031	9	a	[A] brightly moronic young adult romance.
9032	4	a	The movie is always interesting from a narrative point of view. Spielberg is a good storyteller with a good tale to tell. But it never really adds up to anything.
9033	2	a	a noteworthy debut that questions common perceptions of serial killers while showcasing the heretofore unknown talents of its star
9034	6	a	Performances from the young cast are arguably a little too slick and knowing for the naive characters they are playing, but that is often par for the course in American films these days.
9035	1	a	Paper Heart charmed the jaded pants off of me.
9036	5	a	Director Vondie Curtis-Hall squanders a perfectly decent cast on a corny and surprisingly dull urban thriller.
9037	3	a	Every bit as unpleasant as it sounds. But the film's intentions are to examine a separation, and the story achieves its set goals.
9038	8	a	Well, it's about this shark...
9039	9	a	This is the sort of movie that panders to teens ... while it ineffectually lectures them about the need to bear down on the books.
9040	6	a	It's not exactly stupid. Cynical might be a better word.
9041	5	a	A jumble of kiddie slapstick and pointless chases.
9042	5	a	Showing off your stars, ogling the Grand Canal and draping everyone in Colleen Atwood's glamorous threads is not enough in itself to pass as Hitchcock homage, unless your favourite Hitchcock film is To Catch a Thief.
9043	0	a	The source of this movie's galvanizing intrigue is that the characters remain in play -- they never settle into place
9044	6	a	There's a Director's Cut version of Jonah Hex, right? Because this film feels like a series of bullet points disguised as a feature film.
9045	5	a	A stoner's delight that is part fever dream and part bad trip, Inherent Vice is a dark and wickedly wild neo-noir romp. But it's also a thing of unusual density and often incoherence.
9046	4	a	Only if you've never seen one before, it's the best sci-fi movie ever made. It's entertaining, but essentially a shiny new retread of older models.
9047	6	a	An overheated melodrama that plays like an art-house version of the gloriously awful Wild Orchid.
9048	3	a	This is a costume drama where the costume is the drama.
9049	5	a	Pointless knock-off of NATURAL BORN KILLERS. Duchovny and Forbes both miscast and wasted. Juliette Lewis is annoying as ever.
9050	4	a	There really isn't anything terribly fresh nor distinctive here.
9051	0	a	"Ghostbusters"" is a fun romp with a couple of comedy's greatest stars at the top of their game."
9052	0	a	One of the great coming-of-age movies, and also one of the great movies of teasing courtship
9053	2	a	a joy to watch
9054	5	a	I'd say this film is moronic, but that would be an insult to morons.
9055	4	a	A ton of potential, but ultimately a mess.
9056	3	a	As beautifully shot as it is perversely scripted, and you're likely to love it or hate it but not feel indifferently.
9057	0	a	It is gripping, challenging, engrossing stuff, beginning to end. Seriously, what a film.
9058	4	a	The film survives some dodgy dialogue because of a strong supporting cast.
9059	5	a	Without Channing Tatum, the appeal of this faltering franchise fades, except for the dance sequences.
9060	2	a	The film swings like a pendulum between stillness and action, an occasionally jarring mix of David Lean-like panoramas with intimate character study.
9061	4	a	Too bad this blast-from-the-past mucho macho male reunion movie is so absurdly incoherent.
9062	0	a	Colorful, tuneful, brassy musical version of Berlin's hit Broadway show.
9063	2	a	Another adventure in The Hundred Acre Forest, another great title in Disney's live action movie set piece. [Full review in Spanish]
9064	6	a	Forget the usual Transylvania or London settings: This horror flick has the distinction of being set in scary Mississippi.
9065	5	a	Philip Roth remains without a Nobel and without a film to the height of its work. [Full review in Spanish]
9066	3	a	Some say this movie lacks character development...but I'd like to know exactly how you develop a character who doesn't know who he is.
9067	4	a	It's fitting that a movie in which the last comes first, in which the dessert acts as appetizer, that the best of Benjamin begins the proceedings. But, as followed by blander courses, ultimately dissatisfying.
9068	4	a	Given the zing and zip of [screenwriter] Morgan's prior work, it's fair to guess that the film's want of rhythm and sweep is due to Justin Chadwick's pedestrian direction.
9069	3	a	Newcomer Gaspard Ulliel impresses as Lecter, displaying for us a young man losing his humanity and increasing his hatred by degrees.
9070	3	a	Another vibrant film directed by David O. Russell that is bursting with colorful characters, funny scenes, and standout performances. 
9071	10	a	It's unclear if boredom is one of the million ways you can die in the west, but it nearly took us out while watching this film.
9072	3	a	A deceptively straightforward film that has the force of tragedy and the depth of first-rate investigative journalism.
9073	3	a	Though the prison break and heist scenes are slickly and efficiently staged, the film's great strength is its good nature.
9074	4	a	This animated comedy is decidedly not for kids; it's rambunctiously filthy in more ways than one. And while it's not exactly hilarious, it's at least consistently amusing and has a positive attitude. 
9075	4	a	The brief but exciting climax almost, but not quite, redeems such deficiencies. 
9076	2	a	The movie loses some momentum at the end, but overall it's worth a trip to the Retail Rodeo to check it out.
9077	3	a	For French film fans, this is the equivalent of Bob Dylan, the surviving Beatles and the Rolling Stones jamming in the studio with an adoring producer behind the glass.
9078	4	a	The entertaining action scenes are as weighty and gnarly as the actors' grizzled mugs.
9079	5	a	If the movie is relentless low-brow swill, its splattery good cheer makes it hard to hate. Just go in expecting the expected, and maybe bring a tarp.
9080	4	a	Perhaps because both elements are such ultra-easy targets for satire, the film works only about half the time.
9081	7	a	Steven Spielberg's inner child has given us untold worlds of wonder. Now, it seems, the time has come to pay the piper.
9082	4	a	Well intentioned but underwhelming.
9083	3	a	[Schindler's List] is a very good piece of cinema and those who are ready to spend three hours in front of the screen would be rewarded with a powerful, thought-provoking piece of seventh art.
9084	4	a	Jolie gives it that extra little something that makes it worth checking out at theaters, especially if you're in the mood for something more comfortable than challenging.
9085	3	a	Fantastic and banal, terrifying and occasionally dull, pure Spielberg and yet at times anonymous, War of the Worlds delivers multiple viewing experiences during its two-hour running time.
9086	4	a	"An average Aardman effort is still better than most of what passes for family entertainment, and ""Early Man"" does win you over, but perhaps just not as much as it should've."
9087	4	a	Lee's film, rambling and maddeningly vague as it often is, does manage eventually to get at why something so ephemeral meant so much to so many.
9088	4	a	There are memes about white people tears, too, though the movie's final scream of horror might actually be funnier than any of them.
9089	9	a	Eat. Pray. Love. Barf....A celebration of self-indulgence trying to pass itself off as profound soul-searching.
9090	2	a	A hilariously campy and surprisingly diverting horror sequel that's always smartly aware of its own ridiculousness.
9091	0	a	This is one of the best family entertainment films to come out in recent years.
9092	4	a	In its best moments, Russell's film marries melancholy with winsomeness, despair with elation.
9093	4	a	Say what you will about 'Rango,' the computer-animated Western riding hard on Johnny Depp doing the voice of a lizard - just don't call it business as usual. 
9094	1	a	The film is beautifully shot and the performances are outstanding.
9095	3	a	Funny and quirky, with a great performance by Ricci. Gallo quickly grows annoying, though.
9096	1	a	"In a wicked display of tension and percolating drama, Josie Rourke's smartly effective and intoxicating ""Mary Queen of Scots"" showcases two grandiose performances from Academy Award nominees Saoirse Ronan and Margot Robbie."
9097	4	a	A testament to the determination of the human spirit but the characters are fairly indistinguishable and the plot is just one foot in front of another
9098	3	a	Would it be heresy on my part to suggest that Fiddler isn't much as a musical, and that director Norman Jewison has made as good a film as can be made from a story that is quite simply boring?
9099	0	a	A looming, terrifying catch of the day.
9100	3	a	Utterly vile, purposefully malicious and just stone brilliant a good deal of the time, Team America: World Police contains something to offend virtually everybody. Yes, even you.
9101	1	a	At the end of The Man Without a Past, I felt a deep but indefinable contentment.
9102	4	a	The filmmakers probably thought the truth would be too upsetting for children, so we get walrus farts instead.
9103	5	a	As macho and phallus-worshipping as any Schwarzenegger action movie.
9104	8	a	...feels a little haphazard and undercooked...
9105	3	a	It's a grim vision of a world losing track of objective facts, descending into a poisonous abyss of chaos and disorder. No wonder it strikes such a contemporary chord.
9106	4	a	[Annette] Bening's is a real character study and conveys the bundles of emotions and memories of an actress at the end of her career.
9107	0	a	It's just plain excellent.
9108	4	a	Most likely, the real Elizabeth never had such a memorable, action-packed evening. But it's fun to imagine, if only for a moment, that behind the facade of stately hats and matching suits, the queen is hiding some wacky stories.
9109	5	a	Unless you're a real Romano fan, take the bypass.
9110	6	a	A litany of humiliations befalls the protagonist, fitting given that this adaptation of Jeff Kinney's popular kids-lit series is itself a minor embarrassing misfire.
9111	4	a	a slow starter, and it never really speeds up into a thrilling film, save for one scene of war on the ocean. However, it's not meant to be fast-paced or riveted with action.
9112	6	a	"What we end up with is an incomprehensible, overly-long explosion-fest that could have easily been retitled ""A.D.D.: The Motion Picture."
9113	4	a	It is neither as clever nor as funny nor as inventive as the daring title might lead one to expect.
9114	3	a	A richly intoxicating brew of humour, violence and melancholy.
9115	6	a	Breaking up may be hard to do. And it's not so easy to watch, either.
9116	3	a	From one scene to the next, you never know what to expect, and that's thrilling.
9117	5	a	What might have made for exciting action scenes tend to become mechanical exercises in first-person-shooter monster-blasting.
9118	4	a	The best one can say is that it's a smart cartoon, and a fairly exhausting viewing experience.
9119	3	a	A lot more sweaty fun than the last three overhyped, sterile, for-dorks-only Star Wars cartoons.
9120	3	a	Fincher's film is dark and twisted, bleak and brutal: everything the book's fans would want.
9121	2	a	Enjoyable and charming if overactive.
9122	3	a	A pleasantly screwy surprise.
9123	3	a	First-time director Iain Softley makes the film more visually distinctive than most music bios.
9124	3	a	The movie plays everything for laughs, but there's a serious layer somewhere way down deep.
9125	6	a	It's a photocopy of a photocopy of a photocopy.
9126	3	a	As always, Whedon's sci-fi fantasies smartly parallel the serious issues we're grappling with here on Earth, while his protagonists remain mordantly funny in the face of utter disaster.
9127	4	a	War of the Worlds pushes some of the right buttons and enough of the wrong ones to make you wish that Spielberg would move on from aliens already and use his unparalleled talents to focus once more on earth.
9128	3	a	Battle Royale is a masterpiece of mayhem, violence and unfettered teen melodrama. 
9129	4	a	With all the effort put in by the animators, this should have been a classic.
9130	10	a	Unaccompanied Minors may not be the worst holiday comedy ever made, but frankly I can't think of something from that genre that sinks lower than this frighteningly bad movie.
9131	5	a	The story feels stale and the characters ... sink too often to sketch-comedy stereotypes.
9132	4	a	Depp is stunning as a man who squanders his soul, his talent and his body, while Malkovich is exceptional as Charles II, underplaying the role to beautiful effect.
9133	4	a	Sam Catlin's script may actually be a little too subtle, and connective tissue joining this diverse group of characters is rendered perilously thin.
9134	4	a	The film does effectively pump the audience to the point of being ravenous for the hook-handed villain to start his spree.
9135	6	a	a tough watch despite the odd moment of inspiration
9136	1	a	Playful...the most conspicuously repeated word is 'game,' the most dangerous of which Bond typically is, pursues, or plays.
9137	6	a	Still, it's impossible not to admire any movie with a soundtrack that includes Helen Kane singing 'I Wanna Be Loved by You' and Slim Whitman yodeling 'I Remember You.'
9138	1	a	"We get the gadgets, the nods to previous Bond films, the martinis and all but ""Skyfall"" succeeds by not resting on its veritable history but by adding more depth to the celebrated franchise."
9139	4	a	The chemistry between McDormand, Ian and goody-two-shoes Alex is soggy rather than sexy.
9140	3	a	An ambitious, great, and flawed film ... [it] reminds us that this man never quit loving us, never quit forgiving his enemies, even as they tore him to shreds. 
9141	4	a	Exquisitely crafted, curiously uninvolving.
9142	9	a	This one burns going down, like cheap Chianti.
9143	4	a	It has a poise and serenity that prove impressive.
9144	6	a	Hardly challenging.
9145	3	a	The performances are terrific.
9146	7	a	This isn't a movie; it's a symptom.
9147	6	a	Hereafter is a disappointing flick containing great potential that leads to absolutely nothing. 
9148	3	a	The chimp comes out of it well. Homo sapiens, of course, is found wanting.
9149	6	a	As for Close, she looks nothing like a man. Nor much like a woman.
9150	6	a	Roos' film is a misfire, but only just.
9151	4	a	Whereas a TV version of the same material might flounder, this slick, big-budget film works because there is legitimate doubt as to both the level of guilt of the accused and the outcome of the trial.
9152	6	a	Has a genuinely goofy premise, and is far more original than the other sequels. But if you look at it as a horror film, which it is, that is where the film fails.
9153	6	a	Rarely has magic been presented less magically.
9154	3	a	Star Trek spoof boldly mocks where no one has mocked before.
9155	2	a	An interesting story buoyed by good acting that feels - and this is a lazy word but the appropriate one - weird.
9156	1	a	If its opening scenes are like an asthma attack within an iron lung, Weitz stabilizes the material and begins massaging the satire with the brand of human interest that made his other works so distinctive.
9157	7	a	The big, dumb movie of the summer for those who can remember Richard Nixon in the White House.
9158	1	a	Even atheists may find their world rocked by Nati Baratz's Unmistaken Child.
9159	4	a	Matthew McConaughey gives an intensely wry performance while director William Friedkin applies his old-master craftsmanship to a brutal, ugly story. 
9160	9	a	The actual dancing scenes are occasionally electrifying, if far too sparse, but other than that and the welcome sight of co-star Chris Brown getting clocked in the face, the film barely gets off the ground, much less sticks the landing.
9161	7	a	Daddy Day Camp truly is a horrific mess. It's not really a movie for kids; it's a movie for kids by adults who don't have the slightest idea what makes a quality film for any audience ... puerile doesn't even begin to do it justice.
9162	1	a	Paris: C'est magnifique
9163	2	a	A spirited, screwball crime-thriller with a sly heart.
9164	0	a	Few films have ever made better use of combining social and political history with romantic melodrama and suspense.
9165	3	a	As irresistibly sweet as cotton candy.
9166	3	a	this idea that while anything's possible through technology, the debt of that ambition is paid out in blood.
9167	5	a	Pretty animation, weak jokes and a message that feels downright sinister. 
9168	3	a	A triumph. A smart and absurdly funny movie that takes a different view of the war in Afghanistan. Tina Fey is terrific in a different kind of role, and Martin Freeman steals it. 
9169	4	a	If you're ready to go with the hit-and-miss flow, you'll laugh your ass off.
9170	4	a	Sausage Party will likely be remembered more for what it says than how it says it, but that's not the worst thing you can say about a movie.
9171	3	a	Looking at Treasure Planet is a wondrous thing, but listening to it is another matter. The Disney team makes an uncommon mistake by casting actors with distracting voices.
9172	3	a	You won't see a more textured film this summer.
9173	1	a	It's extraordinary how stylized chickens made of clay can exhibit such touching emotion.
9174	5	a	Not funny bad, just bad bad. The worst adaptation of a Michael Crichton book so far.
9175	0	a	A hands-down masterpiece and the best film of the year, so far. Brave the holiday movie-going crowds and give yourself and the family a real treat.
9176	9	a	Not at all funny David Spade movie.
9177	4	a	With a sort of backdoor approach to superherodom, another comic strip from the minds of Stan Lee and Jack Kirby hits the celluloid.
9178	6	a	It's good for nostalgia and a sense of closure, but it isn't much of a movie.
9179	5	a	Zhang's mixture of unsparing violence, mawkish sentimentality and garish flourishes creates one uncomfortable aesthetic.
9180	3	a	The movie's most compelling element of all is Moreau, wandering the nighttime streets trying to find her lover. It's as if she's blown from one cafe to the next on a blended wind of passion, dread and the lonely trumpet wail.
9181	10	a	Essentially, the experience is watching awful actors playing dumb people in a story that carries no weight or emotional investment. This is one pup that needs to be put to sleep.
9182	5	a	This movie goes nowhere, says nothing and does it all with about as much stylistic flourish as a lazy yawn.
9183	6	a	...a thoroughly unmemorable and disappointingly lazy horror endeavor.
9184	5	a	Some intriguing ideas lurk within writer-director Mike Cahill's screenplay, but he would have to be a Stanley Kubrick or a Jonathan Glazer to do justice to them.
9185	1	a	Bright Star is ripe with the eroticism of a proud woman being seduced by words and undone by emotions. If that's not worth more than a year of Megan Fox movies, I can't help you.
9186	4	a	Jammed full with cliches, The Natural never misses a chance to manipulate the audience
9187	3	a	Told with the frank simplicity of a classic well-made picture, it tells its story, nothing more, nothing less, with no fancy stuff.
9188	1	a	As an intimate portrait of the complex, fruitful and extremely volatile friendship between trailblazing African American men whose daring came to redefine an industry, it's fresh and revelatory.
9189	5	a	Diary of a Wimpy Kid is a movie that needs to go back to the drawing board -- literally.
9190	1	a	Flying stacks of bills from Florida, Central America and Europe, The Infiltrator sure makes cartel life look cushy.
9191	4	a	The film celebrates the music and the talent but provides only shorthand glimpses of the biographies and career highlights of the figures involved.
9192	2	a	a substantial first outing
9193	6	a	MacFarlane's fundamental misfire is tied more to the plot than the jokes. He makes a movie about determining the nature of a soul when the individual in question exhibits only behavior that is soulless.
9194	8	a	More than just dumb, the picture is embarrassingly dorky.
9195	4	a	Those who are tired of Hollywood's dead weight aesthetic might at least find some surprise offered here. It's not good, but it's alive on the screen.
9196	2	a	Though initially sold as The Hangover set in Afghanistan, Whiskey Tango Foxtrot is not an outright wacky comedy, but instead tells a much more subtle, dramatic story.
9197	9	a	Why didn't anybody think of doing this kind of weird Bollywood musical murder mystery before? Maybe because it is a stupid idea.
9198	8	a	There are almost no redeeming qualities to this movie. It is bad enough to trigger an existential crisis in the heartiest of movie-lovers.
9199	3	a	... has a solid sense of time and place and character.
9200	10	a	It surely does not contain any socially redeeming value.
9201	6	a	Woe, by the way, unto the good, decent men who cross these women's paths. In the ovarian jungle of Mother and Child, each gent is undervalued in his own way.
9202	3	a	An unusual, science-based metaphysical thriller that manages to be both provocative and romantic.
9203	3	a	The Tourist merely asks you to sit back and enjoy the ride, and then makes that task a breeze.
9204	2	a	An Unexpected Journey is a bit ropey, excessive and padded in places, sure, but if that's the worst and the best is yet to come, then this could end up being another great trilogy.
9205	5	a	A remake that deserves to be put in a burlap sack and drowned like a litter of kittens.
9206	4	a	Romantic thriller has some mature twists.
9207	2	a	Truly independent in mode and spirit, this offebat comedy deserves credit for its original vision of an after-life that's not all that different from this life--only slightly weirder and more darkly humorous.
9208	0	a	Even if you don't understand the game, you'll be biting your nails.
9209	3	a	A most intimate look at the recognition of a peasant child as a prophet. A masterpiece of understatement.
9210	6	a	"Welcome Home Roscoe Jenkins feels like a rudimentary retread of previously outrageous ""black attack"" farces... needlessly cluttered, unfocused and pointless..."
9211	2	a	The only really depressing thing about Love Story is the thought of all of the terrible imitations that will inevitably follow it.
9212	5	a	Wears out its welcome and ability to milk its premise long before its runtime is done.
9213	6	a	It's just another pointlessly dressed-up take on a story that's already plenty overdressed.
9214	4	a	A solid, well-acted tale.
9215	5	a	Jane Got A Gun has the promise of a strong female leading Western; the by the numbers end result doesn't even barely eclipse the central trio's last time on screen. 
9216	9	a	This botched vision accepts the warrior's nobility at face value and sees the story merely as a springboard for high-flying action and CGI special effects.
9217	6	a	Usually these films kick off with a splashy ensemble number to get everyone in the mood but here instead there's a deliberately deflating audition montage. 
9218	3	a	It's good to have Soderbergh back, even if he never was really away.
9219	3	a	Depp's magnificent performance, plus Burton's love of his subject make for a wonderful film. Landau is magnificent as Bela Lugosi. A great film that celebrates the little filmmakers who dreamed big.
9220	3	a	Funny-one-minute, horrifying-the-next film.
9221	6	a	Hardly the all-stops-out tearjerker it strives to be.
9222	5	a	How much fun you have will depend on your tolerance for a diet of non-stop swearing and filthy innuendo. The voice cast don't just rain down f-bombs. They lob in a good few c-grenades for good measure too.
9223	4	a	"The Infiltrator"" is a semi-entertaining drug cartel film that allows for a two hour escape into its world of violence and high-stakes suspense."
9224	3	a	It's not often a movie can make you rant about the lousy ending and give you nightmares.
9225	4	a	This may be the most beautifully shot downer of the year, so woeful is its tone. That said, it's also a pulse-quickening thrill to see these wretched once-upon-a-time rebels going mad for the racket once again.
9226	1	a	The plot is not overtaxing -- it's about guns, drugs and money -- because the real focus is the allure, danger and alienation of hiding behind an assumed identity.
9227	5	a	Guilty pleasure par excellence: How did this poorly-acted schmaltzy romantic melodrama ever get Best Picture Oscar nomination?
9228	5	a	A brilliant idea that somehow misses the mark by a North country mile, Reign of Fire will make monster fans ache for what might have been.
9229	3	a	"Here's a movie that's done well, with quality performances. And I have no idea who will want to see ""The Libertine,"" a sometimes digusting, always adult look at debauchery during the Restoration. "
9230	9	a	Gates and Rae are game, but not funny in the least. The kids are stereotypes, and not particularly amusing ones.
9231	2	a	Has a simultaneously sprawling yet intimate quality.
9232	4	a	We expect beautiful music from The Soloist, but we suffer through some blaring false notes along the way.
9233	8	a	The film isn't terrible if you're, say, six. Because you simply don't know any better.
9234	2	a	Safety Not Guaranteed is a fable of ''redemption,'' and it's too tidy by half, but it is also very sweetly told.
9235	0	a	Speaking of Oscars, the great DeNiro is great once again here.
9236	6	a	Unlike James himself, the movie is a few bricks shy of a load, which explains why a movie obviously ticketed for a holiday release has backed up to mid-January.
9237	4	a	[Depp's] amusingly idiosyncratic, yet surprisingly complex, performance goes a long way toward redeeming this otherwise sketchy film.
9238	1	a	...even the notoriously reshot conclusion comes off as genuinely sweet and touching...
9239	5	a	Errors in logic will delight the attentive.
9240	9	a	A distillation of so many rom-com formulas and conventions it's hard to know whether the filmmakers even realized what they were actually doing.
9241	8	a	A lame farce.
9242	6	a	I figured the screenwriters would rape the show for its best elements, then stoke it with paint-by-numbers action and effect sequences, and I was right.
9243	2	a	"The tragedy of ""Hancock"" is that Will Smith is so damn good in it."
9244	3	a	In short, The Bourne Identity is an excellent thriller and is well-worth checking out.
9245	4	a	It's an affecting tale about sexual identity and people pretending to be other than they are, not only in their everyday dealings but also in ways that go to the very core of their being.
9246	1	a	It's a modern twist on a classic series and just when you might be wondering about yet another iconic Bond element - bingo, the filmmakers deliver with an ending that leaves you wanting more.
9247	6	a	There's only so many shots of beautiful vistas and charming doggies before viewers start wishing for a new cinematic companion, like maybe a nice Travel Channel documentary or the Westminster dog show.
9248	2	a	It's said that one must suffer to be beautiful. Thrilling in places, self-indulgent in others, Saint Laurent strongly suggests that one must suffer to make others beautiful.
9249	4	a	It is enjoyable but no great classic.
9250	0	a	Textured, thoughtful and touching.
9251	0	a	A gravely beautiful drama about the mysteries of aging and death.
9252	3	a	No matter how you interpret the film, it's nearly impossible to deny what a beautiful work of art it is.
9253	5	a	What Gervasi and his scriptwriter John McLaughlin bring to the table are banality and predictability, quintessentially non-Hitchcockian qualities.
9254	7	a	This movie was about the most excruciating hour and a half I've endured recently.
9255	9	a	The producers should have let sleeping dogs lie.
9256	4	a	A sometimes entertaining film, it just never gels.
9257	1	a	For Field, Doris may just herald a career rebirth.
9258	0	a	One of the most entertaining and exciting animated features ever made, one of those rare sequels that bests its predecessor.
9259	4	a	Listening to people bicker for almost two hours wears thin, especially when the comedy is never quite so funny as you had hoped it would be.
9260	4	a	Not all the gags are inspired and the excessive swearing can feel like a substitute for actual jokes, but even if this isn't solid comedy gold, it's still much funnier than a lot of other fluff.
9261	3	a	Because the film filters everything else out but Theron/Wuornos, the performance becomes the end-all, be-all of the film.
9262	9	a	General Jesus Christ is reborn, awarded the most earned Purple Heart in history, and summons his Christian soldiers to march forth and fight whatever battles He calls us to.
9263	3	a	Far from preaching to the converted, this sequel winningly subverts the traditional college comedy while remaining authentically ribald.
9264	5	a	It's too bad Couples Retreat is so poorly written and conceived, given the talented cast and chemistry between Vaughn and pal Favreau. We're meant to relate to these hapless folks or laugh at their foibles, but more often we wince.
9265	1	a	A study in isolation and, yes, paranoia...The mesmerizingly beautiful images--often in slo-mo--glide to evoke Alex's primary pursuit of skating.
9266	5	a	It's not entirely unlikable, but there's nothing here to match the charm of the movies this imitates, nor justify the mood swings that it signally fails to negotiate.
9267	3	a	"Paul Schrader offers a very personal and, at the same time, universalist, film... that even allows brief moments of ""magical realism"". [Full review in Spanish]"
9268	0	a	Powerfully emotional and exquisitely romantic, this is a beautifully made and wonderfully acted film that has every element working together in perfect harmony.
9269	5	a	Offers nothing new to the genre, but for those who like light tales of meet-cute and happily-ever-after, it'll probably be as welcome as a tub of double-fudge ice cream.
9270	0	a	"Despite a generic title and a somewhat formulaic plot, ""Girls Trip"" emerges as the best raunchy comedy since ""Bridesmaids."
9271	0	a	In countless ways visible and invisible, Sirk's sly subversion skewed American popular culture, and helped launch a new age of irony.
9272	4	a	Anne Hathaway does a perfectly acceptable, enchanting job of playing Jane.
9273	7	a	Has the stolidness of a video game, from which it is derived.
9274	6	a	With all the money and talent and hype that went into this film, it should have been a lot better, but it is entertaining enough to rate a passing grade, especially for Robin Williams fans.
9275	6	a	It's photogenic people killing mutants before green screens; what more could you ask?
9276	6	a	The existential angst feels tapped out.
9277	5	a	Highlander: Endgame is truer to the original than the sequels, but it plays more like a television program than a theatrical release, which will matter little to the die-hard fans.
9278	5	a	The overlong, messy and chaotic film is not funny and has no social redeeming value.
9279	6	a	A likable romantic comedy, The Bounce Back may not scream true love, but it's companionable enough until something better comes along.
9280	3	a	Reign of Fire is a fun action flick, but it could have used more dragons and fewer slow moments.
9281	2	a	Relentlessly filthy and often jaw-droppingly funny, this creation bearing the prolific imprint of Seth Rogen and Evan Goldberg is one of the most transgressive animated films to emerge from Hollywood in recent memory.
9282	6	a	In the end, what will be remembered is how disappointing a treatment this is of some pretty revered source material.
9283	4	a	We Bought a Zoo has its charms. It also has a lot to live up to -- and misses the mark.
9284	5	a	The problem isn't that the movie wears its religious intent on its sleeve but that it uses religion as an easy, all-purpose fix to ... every problem that its characters face.
9285	3	a	Soderbergh keeps the action light and playful, and lets the cast members find their own silliness within it.
9286	6	a	There's no spark in the romance because people in romantic comedies are simply not allowed to be people anymore: they're hair and outfits inside a premise.
9287	4	a	It's a bit like a Latin American episode of The Bill written by Richard Littlejohn and directed by Chuck Norris.
9288	2	a	The directing and writing team of Mark Neveldine and Brian Taylor have between them a boundless imagination, constantly topping one absurdly overstated moment with another, even more absurd.
9289	6	a	... the director seeks to reflect on the hero without finding the pulse of his heroism. [Full review in Spanish]
9290	7	a	The dogs carry the film appropriately, perhaps even outacting their human costars. Especially Cheadle, who should really have a long conversation with his agent about his future in worthwhile film roles.
9291	4	a	The movie never equals the performance, but still fascinating to watch.
9292	1	a	Has the languid intensity of a dream.
9293	1	a	A showcase of early Hitchcock suspense.
9294	1	a	Elizabeth Gilbert's phenomenally popular memoir was funny, insightful, and well-written. Amazingly, so is the film. 
9295	3	a	Writer-director John Sayles has successfully tackled so many unexpected subjects that one has to wonder if he's got a dartboard in his office to help him pick his next topic.
9296	6	a	Plays by the strict and proper rules of the period genre, resulting in a predominantly frigid and impersonal love story.
9297	4	a	Packed with great music and some fine performances from a terrific cast.
9298	2	a	Such is the inherent power of the Carver material that Jindabyne rises above its polemics.
9299	5	a	Fantastic Four is anything but, and should serve as an indication that maybe its time to put the brakes on the current avalanche of comic book adaptations.
9300	2	a	"...finely tuned situations and sharp dialogue delivered by a thoroughly charming cast that makes this ""Simon"" something special."
9301	5	a	The only redeeming feature of this clunky demonic horror film is the assured turn from professional scary child Ferland.
9302	0	a	A movie that will satisfy hip-hop and Eminem fans in ways they never expected; even more significantly, it will touch people who thought they hated hip-hop and/or Eminem in ways they would have never expected.
9303	6	a	A lopsided, visually uninspired film that works best when it eschews the complex numbers-crunching of its financial industry pundits and whistle-blowers to profile the everyday victims of the crisis.
9304	3	a	Southern flavor, rampant goofiness and fun twangs go a long way in making director Steven Soderbergh's cinematic return such a sparkling hoot.
9305	2	a	An entertaining but unspectacular film. Pretty goofy at times - but the slick and gleefully self-indulgent violence will not disappoint the action fan.
9306	5	a	With this ersatz sting flick, [Furman's] made something so amateurish and baffling that it comes around to being memorable.
9307	3	a	It's about as much fun as you'll have at a movie this summer, especially if you see it at one of those theaters that serve beer.
9308	3	a	There is no grand sense of justice or even vengeance driving The Green Hornet; it is just that kicking ass might be fun, and it turns out it is.
9309	2	a	Is it possible that Jennifer Aniston has now out-performed and out-classed gust star Sean Penn or Lisa Kudrow's performance in The Crazysitter ?
9310	1	a	A slightly messy movie, but it's also one of the year's best.
9311	3	a	When the leader of the rebels turns out to be Baby Herman from Who Framed Roger Rabbit, it's clear that the satirical bull's-eyes Verhoeven nailed in RoboCop have here been turned into a more benign state of rib-nudging.
9312	3	a	Morgan Freeman takes on Mandela's mannerisms with grace. He nails the self-assuredness, the ease with which the inspiring leader emerged from the twinkling, low-key charmer.
9313	5	a	Unfortunately in this instance, more doesn't make merry, only mayhem.
9314	4	a	It's smartly produced and slightly more streamlined than Sorcerer's Stone, its predecessor, but at almost three hours it's still too slavishly faithful to its source and will no doubt try the patience of Muggle moppets.
9315	6	a	Vantage Point is the highlights reel of an action movie too average to watch in any other form.
9316	1	a	A heartwarming and inspirational journey that follows likable people who are forced to dig deep into themselves to find the strength to deal with the difficulties life deals them.
9317	6	a	"Packed with more voice-over narration than a docent's tour of the Metropolitan Museum, ""Middle Men"" is formulaic to a fault. "
9318	5	a	A Southern Gothic pulp-noir freak show, yee-haw.
9319	1	a	[Bosco's] performance as a senior going through the motions of aging is hypnotic, heartbreaking, and dead-on. It's the kind of performance awards were created for.
9320	1	a	You want horror that screws with your head? This is your ticket, a haunting story of two families surviving the postapocalypse proves there's a major new filmmaking talent in town, Trey Edward Shults
9321	7	a	The Other Boleyn Girl is almost too indescribable for words. It's one of the most visually boring films I've seen in some time.
9322	2	a	Entertaining, spirited and shamelessly gimmicky, Christopher Nolan's film tells the intricate tale of two rival magicians practicing their art in late-Victorian London.
9323	4	a	With just the slightest tilt toward black comedy, Valkyrie could have been the Dilbert of Nazi movies.
9324	9	a	This is a cheesy soap opera that dearly wants to be a country and western All About Eve. The songs aren't too bad; the dialogue is.
9325	3	a	It's refreshing to see romantic drama where credulity hasn't been stretched by the magic of Hollywood or the fantasies of the mind.
9326	6	a	Rogers seemed lost.
9327	5	a	Hopkins has been fitted out prosthetically to resemble Hitchcock and he does a reasonably good job of impersonating him, but it's a foredoomed effort.
9328	0	a	A lean, mean amorality tale that still goes down like a cookie laced with arsenic.
9329	1	a	It's easy to run out of superlatives when describing this movie... no doubt this is one of the best pictures of the year.
9330	2	a	I found that it provided a pretty convincingly immersive experience, and I look forward to the technology's evolution/refinement. Which I guess also means I look forward to the next two installments of the trilogy.
9331	7	a	"It's soapy melodrama with the fun dampened by ""verisimilitude"" - a Marvel-movie treatment for the book-club set."
9332	3	a	Mostly makes you want to go home and have a shower.
9333	0	a	Schindler's List is filmed in black and white, but the triumph of Neeson's portrait and Steven Zaillian's screenplay is that Oskar Schindler remains gray and enigmatic.
9334	1	a	Charlize Theron has always had the chops...but to date few in Hollywood have seen past her looks. That's about to change.
9335	4	a	It is so busy with its crosscut structure and its interlocking stories that it never really gives us anyone to identify with.
9336	3	a	Bardem gives what might have been too slow and plodding a movie its heart and its humor.
9337	6	a	Not one of McConaughey's best films
9338	3	a	No less magical, no less engaging, and no less kid-pleasing than its record-breaking predecessor. It's also no shorter...
9339	5	a	...that most maddening of motion picture paradigms - a great concept badly bungled. 
9340	5	a	Amusing, perhaps, but really funny? No.
9341	5	a	Even among the ranks of the diminutive, this one's got nothing to boast about.
9342	0	a	Another great movie from the guys who did Shallow Grave.
9343	5	a	Except for the opening surveillance sequence, you'd never guess that Florian Henckel von Donnersmarck also directed the Oscar-winning The Lives of Others.
9344	3	a	Deliriously entertaining and sexy.
9345	5	a	This is just a giant slurp of cinematic Sunny D, quenching the thirst for instant fun with CGI sweeteners and a fast-acting concoction of other slapstick additives.
9346	6	a	Mars Needs Moms isn't much of a movie, but it's a great teaching tool for how not to make an animated film.
9347	4	a	There's enough that works here for it to be an enjoyable enough experience, but I do feel like this is a movie I'm going to mostly forget about by summer's end.
9348	3	a	A gem of a movie.
9349	3	a	"The Imitation Game"" translates Turing and his team's achievement for a lay audience, while dramatizing the personal, scientific and bureaucratic obstacles they faced."
9350	1	a	Romero's best film in a quarter century ...
9351	3	a	The film's familiarity is pleasant enough, and screenwriters Sarah Williams and Kevin Hood flaunt a strong working knowledge of Austen's work, peppering the movie with what amounts to inside jokes for readers familiar with the writer's six novels.
9352	6	a	...very slow and very gentle...
9353	5	a	MacFarlane is content to act like a monkey flinging its own poop at everyone in close proximity, and most of the material, unshackled from anything of import, is either stretched beyond the breaking point or witless in the first place.
9354	3	a	Elegant and incadescent, it revels in its innate intelligence.
9355	5	a	There's nothing about this plotline that doesn't feel like a retread, and MacFarlane, I'm sorry to report, still seems like the funniest guy in the writers' room rather than a genuine movie star.
9356	4	a	The basic message of Christianity -- love your brother -- is obscured under torrents of blood to the point of benumbing the audience.
9357	4	a	Invigorating, revolutionary, joyfully iconoclastic and spontaneous.
9358	2	a	The movie is a good, not great period piece bolstered by Close's subtle, contained performance as the heartbreakingly lonely waiter.
9359	0	a	Majestic and thought-provoking, Embrace of the Serpent presents a vivid vision of a lost world, and is touching in its closing dedication to 'peoples whose song we will never know.'
9360	4	a	The squeaky clean love story of Jane Austen fails to make hay of either women's liberation or the miracle of creative writing, sticking to lush estates and courtly costume finery instead
9361	5	a	Like a museum piece, placing historical figures in frozen positions, and asking us to judge them as the curators do.
9362	5	a	Angelina Jolie's romance/comedy/drama isn't terribly romantic, comedic or dramatic.
9363	4	a	It may be a bit too violent for the very young moviegoers, but older children and parents may have a good time together watching some make-believe heroes transform themselves into the real McCoys.
9364	7	a	A haunted mansion that from moment to moment is pretty to look at but turns out to be utterly empty inside. 
9365	6	a	Until Lee figures out what he really thinks, his movies are going to express more confusion than clarity.
9366	6	a	MacFarlane's best jokes come from that crazy, yet very true statement as we see all of the ways someone can die in the godforsaken dirt bowl that is the Wild Wild West. 
9367	3	a	Almodovar's storytelling is as outrageously stylish and compelling as it's ever been, though some of the character developments are disappointingly downbeat.
9368	4	a	A bit rubbish, but enjoyable none the less.
9369	4	a	Nick Cassavetes' new film, Alpha Dog, has a compelling, ripped-from-the-headlines vibe.
9370	3	a	It was epochs in the making, and, as usual, it was worth every millennium.
9371	5	a	Has obviously been hacked to pieces and is hampered by lazy supporting performances, several utterly pointless scenes and the fact that all the violence happens offscreen.
9372	3	a	A paean to reckless driving and fuel inefficency, this fifth film in the franchise is the most spectacular and elaborate yet, bringing new meaning to the term 'muscle car' by pitting series regular Vin Diesel against Dwayne 'The Rock' Johnson.
9373	1	a	Has the right amount of sincerity, schmaltz and silliness to make Bolt entertaining for everyone
9374	9	a	If the daydreams of a teenager playing Grand Theft Auto could be made into a music video, the result would resemble Waist Deep.
9375	4	a	When it's playing for laughs, 'A Royal Night Out' is harmless good fun. But the film stalls when straying into serious-drama territory. 
9376	8	a	It will come as no surprise that the movie isn't scary. But here's the real damn: It isn't funny, either.
9377	4	a	Fans of the series will consider this a must-see... For people not dying to know his origins, though, Hannibal Rising is, at best, a mildly diverting thriller...
9378	1	a	One of the most thoughtful and startling snapshots of the human condition of the last ten years.
9379	3	a	Ok, Paper Towns plays it safe, but Nat Wolff and Cara Delevingne are irresistible so we're never sorry. 
9380	4	a	This is one of those rare movies that genuinely likes its characters and wishes them the best; as agonizing as it can be to watch Jack fumble toward human connection, Hoffman knows the fumbling's the point.
9381	4	a	My Best Friend's Picture Perfect Wedding, er, I mean The Wedding Date...is surprisingly engaging--mostly... 
9382	4	a	Emblematic of a freewheeling, free love culture that never really existed, it's a true camp classic, a unique amalgamation of pulp themes and a pseudo-historical treasure.
9383	4	a	The Soloist has all the elements of an uplifting drama, except for the uplift. The story is compelling, the actors are in place, but I was never sure what the filmmakers wanted me to feel about it.
9384	8	a	Sick.
9385	2	a	Sensitive, compassionate storytelling.
9386	6	a	Fantastic it ain't, but not bad it sort of is.
9387	1	a	The finely nuanced script takes a sensitive look at this disease and its effects, not only on the person afflicted, but also on family members who have to deal with it.
9388	1	a	Many may see this as a more grown-up version of Forrest Gump, but it feels to me like something from the pen of Charlie Kaufman, who enjoys playing with time and conventions in much the way Fincher and Roth do here.
9389	6	a	Overall it's basically a crass marketing concept closer to Beverly Hills Chihuahua than a fully conceived work of art like Wall-E.
9390	4	a	"Whiskey Tango Foxtrot"" is interesting and mildly entertaining, but not much else."
9391	3	a	Instead of the social-realism approach taken by most movies dealing with drug subcultures, Trainspotting observes its subjects with a mordant eye -- an inclusive perspective...
9392	1	a	...coasts on sheer joy.
9393	2	a	Engaged filmmaking that makes a political point, and the observant script and incisive direction give it considerable power.
9394	6	a	The Expendables is admirable for bringing these actors all together, but shameful for not having the integrity to do anything of value with them.
9395	4	a	"Another gentle charmer from the ""Wallace and Grommit"" folks."
9396	8	a	For a film that warns about the dangers of consumerism, one can only wonder how many more times will Mr. Lucas force this lesser work of his upon an uncaring public before he lets the film slip back into obscurity.
9397	5	a	Clumsy and cute - that's my concise review of regular Sacha Baron Cohen collaborator Dan Mazer's directorial debut I Give It a Year.
9398	6	a	Chappaquiddick has the makings of a political thriller, but Curran's decision to avoid speculation, while laudable, takes the wind out of the film's sails.
9399	9	a	It is reliant on McCarthy's comedy chops and her ability to deliver improv-type character material, but almost every single one of her scenes looks like an outtake.
9400	1	a	Veronica Mars will inevitably delight fans of the series to no end, but newbies shouldn't be shy -- it's actually quite the perfect introduction to the series.
9401	6	a	A solid opening and a mayhem-laden third act cannot make up for an utter mess of a middle hour or for the utter lack of charisma by Jay Chou as Kato.
9402	4	a	Unable to really turn chilly menace into tough, action-packed fun.
9403	8	a	The most amateurish, inadvertently funny studio film in recent memory.
9404	4	a	I'm willing to overlook some lowest-common-denominator idiocy in favor of some well-produced nature photography.
9405	4	a	Where the flight from hell leads is no great shake, but getting there is exciting enough to be worth the trip.
9406	5	a	While Letters to God is certainly family-friendly, the blandness robs it of whatever emotion or redemption the filmmakers were shooting for.
9407	3	a	It took me to a time and a place in history I'd really only known thanks to my mother's stories, Lee and Schamus capturing that very same whimsical devil-may-care vibe inherent in all of them.
9408	4	a	Angelina is appealing doing the girly girl thing. 
9409	6	a	There's no reason to spend good, hard-earned dollars on seeing this one at the theater.
9410	4	a	The film will keep children amused without proving too much of an ordeal for grown-ups.
9411	3	a	Ride the High Country vigorously and colorfully brings alive the Old West of cinematic myth.
9412	1	a	Writer-director Michel Hazanavicius loads The Artist with magical, romantic moments.
9413	4	a	It's easy to see why David Fincher wanted to make it, but hard to shake the feeling that perhaps he shouldn't have bothered.
9414	3	a	Expanded to its intended length, the movie feels not like a failed narrative hastily washed in luridness but a purposefully meandering allegory of artistic frustration.
9415	6	a	Think Like a Man Too, a sequel that, if we were to use a relationship metaphor, is like a really bad rebound date.
9416	3	a	An excellent, twisted, funny film back when Burton didn't get in the way of his own filmmaking.
9417	4	a	Straightforward but convincing, Black Nativity is refreshingly restrained, making it a nice counterpoint to other, noisier holiday entertainment.
9418	3	a	... pay your money and take the ride,... laugh and ... be strangely moved by the odd-looking creatures Russell has assembled for his latest ensemble play.
9419	4	a	Jayro Bustamante's debut Ixcanul is a profoundly humanistic inquiry into the trafficking of Mayan children in North America.
9420	3	a	A slick, surprising summer entertainment from a terrific director who's having a helluva time just keeping everyone laughing, and guessing.
9421	9	a	The humor in Sam Harper's script is as malnourished as Hilary Duff appears to be.
9422	9	a	Yes, there's pointed human comedy to be mined from the very real stresses of married life, but this bonehead idiots-in- paradise farce raises issues only to gloss them over.
9423	0	a	As far as popcorn summer flicks go, this one's error-free.
9424	1	a	How to sing the praises of Lost in Translation without drowning out its subtle pleasures?
9425	5	a	Dupree's presence is annoying and disruptive, but not remotely convincing as a legitimate catalyst for exposing anything insightful, amusing or charming about modern relationships.
9426	5	a	Spike Lee would have none of this nonsense.
9427	6	a	This new movie looks and feels like someone else's better-made schlock.
9428	7	a	If kids cared about adults's mid-life crises, Hook would be Robin Williams' most beloved movie. Disney's Christopher Robin may make overworked adults verklemt, but it also may bore children stupid.
9429	5	a	Graphic rape and killing battle heroism and sacrifice.
9430	2	a	One of those movies that keeps you with a silly grin on your face throughout the majority of its running time.
9431	0	a	Nebraska is undeniable; agonisingly hilarious, unyielding in its paternal love and devastatingly authentic to the ache of life closer to its end than the beginning.
9432	6	a	The result isn't spiritual awakening, but a talky travelogue - like riding a tour bus with a passenger who won't shut up about her inner journey.
9433	4	a	[Writer/director Cassavetes] never masters the tone and lands as many unintentional laughs as intentional ones. But he still manages, on occasion, to chill you to the bone.
9434	6	a	More wearisome than appealing.
9435	0	a	Delivers a sucker punch to the audience and then pulls the rug out from under it. It is sensational.
9436	0	a	What do I already know after just one screening? That this belongs on the short list of the best comedies of the last twenty years.
9437	4	a	Without Sam L. Jackson on hand, I suspect Coach Carter would be almost too generic to even deal with.
9438	0	a	The postmodern heir to North By Northwest...Like any deathless classic, Raiders is a perfect marriage of star and material.
9439	4	a	If you can get past the fussiness, you'll like it.
9440	6	a	Giving some thought to the desperation that leads to suicide would have prevented this vaguely conceived idea from being so DOA.
9441	1	a	As a visual exercise, it's a dazzling achievement, filmed in a manner that's almost impossible to describe.
9442	3	a	America's dark and lonely back roads are the prime location for stories about relentless, psychotic stalkers preying on the youth.
9443	3	a	... is lively, cunning and witty. [Full review in Spanish]
9444	2	a	An adventurous ode to growing up.
9445	5	a	Not up to Grant's stature
9446	4	a	Space Jam is no Who Framed Roger Rabbit, but it works well enough.
9447	9	a	A minefield of stupidity and degradation -- and not in a good way.
9448	9	a	The first film to be based on a line of toys, this might not be the last, but it'd take something awful to replace it as the worst.
9449	1	a	David O. Russell enters Marty Scorsese territory with the sagacious wit of Mark Twain and satire and slapstick worthy of Preston Sturges
9450	5	a	The plot holes are obvious and disconcerting, the sub-plots feel tacked-on, and the characters are both thinly-drawn and badly-played.
9451	4	a	...a film that reminds us of the limitations of snap judgements.
9452	2	a	In his feature debut, director Roman Coppola brings visual flair with an infectious kitsch quotient and an assured dramatic sensibility.
9453	1	a	What could be simplistic schmaltz ends up being a harsh rebuke of symbolic gestures.
9454	8	a	If there were any justice, Next Friday would be the last Friday. Somehow, I fear the first weekend grosses will make that unlikely.
9455	3	a	First-time screenwriters Taylor Allen and Andrew Logan's tight script sticks mostly to the well-documented facts and aftermath, and Clarke lets his Teddy live in the tricky place between sympathy and straight villain-hood.
9456	6	a	...glib, well produced, and reasonably well acted, adding up to slick pop drivel.
9457	1	a	"In scene after scene, ""Menashe"" strikes complex notes without telegraphing how the audience should feel."
9458	0	a	Amadeus is a masterful combination of acting and storytelling, of sight and sound.
9459	2	a	Fortunately, Saddam Hussein was unable to access Charlize's make-up people.
9460	2	a	Lead performance from Fanny Ardant is superbly measured, bringing an interesting internalization to an occasionally, but not crushingly, routine look at the power of flirtation. 
9461	1	a	Revolutionary Road is a very well-made film indeed, and if it stings a little, that is only a testament to how strong a work it is.
9462	3	a	The movie takes a simple if shattering occurrence and uses it as a way to bring a family together, an old trick but one well played by director Lawrence Kasdan and his wife and screenwriting partner Meg.
9463	1	a	I can't think of a better way to spend two hours at the movies with my family.
9464	3	a	Just when you think you've seen every computer trick and gimmick that can possibly stick to a screen, along comes a new advance that puts the 'special' back in special effects.
9465	4	a	Light enough in tone, but plastic. 
9466	2	a	A faithful homage to a foolish genre. The risk is that audiences who don't share that love won't appreciate the work, like the world's best cover band nailing obscure nu-metal hits
9467	10	a	While Danica McKellar is busy extolling the virtues of mathematics to young females of America, her erstwhile leading man Fred Savage can be found toiling for a far less noble cause.
9468	6	a	There isn't an enjoyable character in the bunch of this tragedy that constantly spirals downward.
9469	3	a	The film surrounding the performance is not always as strong, but the centre holds, and magnificently so.
9470	1	a	Tempting as it might be to dismiss McCandless as a hare-brained hippie, he's not so easily reduced, and Penn does well to honor his slippery nature, even as he's clearly awed by his grand adventure.
9471	4	a	Extremely modest, featherweight. But watchable. 
9472	2	a	It would feel overly theatrical if Watts, Bening, and Washington didn't convey the vulnerability beneath every firm demurral, lacerating insult, and refusal to engage.
9473	2	a	[Kevin James] proves to be a warm leading man who grounds the movie as it morphs into a loopy heist thriller after a promising start as something entirely different: a gentle comedy of suburban underachievement.
9474	7	a	The actors don't interact so much as issue pronouncements, and there's not a hint of levity to distract from the gravity of the situation.
9475	6	a	If only this workmanlike thriller were as much fun as mimicking Brittany Murphy's singsong delivery of the film's tagline.
9476	7	a	Would be scary if it weren't so stupid.
9477	6	a	Osment doesn't have to worry about looks ending his career early. But more films like Secondhand Lions certainly could.
9478	3	a	Star Johnny Depp and adapter-director David Koepp bring enough wit and peculiarity to the proceedings to make for an entertaining, and sometimes even smart, time.
9479	5	a	About as much fun as having a holiday ruined by bickering, self-involved couples, this is one romcom you really should retreat from.
9480	6	a	A few great performances buoy the proceedings, but the laziness of Morgan's script and the overall lack of focus or momentum combine to sink it.
9481	4	a	Eye-catching and moderately enjoyable...however, in spite of its many strengths the film winds up less clever than it obviously thinks it is.
9482	0	a	...it breathes and evokes the essence of a landscape that throughout the centuries has been sometimes Italian and sometimes Gallic, but always Mediterranean to the marrow: a fertile ground for love or desire. [Full review in Spanish]
9483	6	a	If only first-time directors Chris Williams and Byron Howard would have followed the advice in their own film, Bolt could have turned out to be incredibly extraordinary.
9484	4	a	... a well-made refined tearjerker melodrama that would have profited more as a screwball comedy.
9485	2	a	Retains enough Smith-isms to help navigate all potholes in execution. Flawed, yes, but Mallrats has its charms when it isn't shoving its hand up its own hindquarters.
9486	0	a	Anderson's great accomplishment here is that he's created a work where there's no past, no future--there only is, man. Groovy.
9487	0	a	What has to stand as cinema's most successful musical epic.
9488	5	a	The negatives in this film far outweigh any of the positives.
9489	4	a	[The story] is often overly simplistic when it is trying hardest for emotional complexity.
9490	4	a	I didn't dislike Welcome to Mooseport; I just didn't like it enough.
9491	6	a	SJP's superficial balancing act predictably collapses.
9492	2	a	Nobbs is a moving, well-etched, humour-peppered film about survival and one small person's dream of liberation.
9493	2	a	Sequel number four proves this franchise isn't getting older - it's getting better.
9494	6	a	A lot like sitting next to your buddy, looking over his shoulder while he plays an old first person shooter on his computer. Watching isn't as fun as playing.
9495	1	a	If I had seen this as a child, I would have thought it was the greatest movie ever made. Having seen it as an adult, I felt like a kid all over again.
9496	4	a	The jokes are mostly funny, the songs are charming, the scatology is only occasionally off-putting and overall it's a pretty good time at ye ol' air-conditioned nickelodeon. 
9497	2	a	While consistently funny, The Break-Up deals in bitterness and revenge, sometimes in ways that cut closer to the bone than most fluffy romantic comedies.
9498	9	a	There is one good movie in Talk to Me and about four bad ones.
9499	3	a	The characters aren't much more well-defined than the anonymous victims of a teen horror movie... The dinosaur effects, however, are absolutely stunning, and sometimes so natural that one even forgets to be impressed.
9500	4	a	Scores miles ahead of torture-porn trash...and even improves on its predecessors in cleverness and suspense. Of course it's still what it is, and that's not much.
9501	3	a	Despite the instances when it strays from, or grossly simplifies, the record...succeeds in presenting an affecting portrait of Alan Turing.
9502	3	a	"In the center, of course, is Bell, still right on target with the wisecracks and attitude that made ""Mars"" work."
9503	3	a	This film was dark, intense, scary, mysterious, and sexy. It has pretty much everything you could ask for in a great ghost film that actually has substance. 
9504	0	a	A mesmerizing movie that veers towards an unbearably tense climax, The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo benefits from invigorating direction and superb acting that allows the old-fashioned mystery to unravel in a hugely satisfying and captivating way.
9505	5	a	Lacks whatever magical ingredient there is that makes a film a moving experience and instead settles for being an adequate but not a remarkable achievement.
9506	9	a	Thanks, Kevin Williamson. Thank you a whole lot.
9507	3	a	The most emotionally satisfying film of the year.
9508	6	a	The man himself and what he accomplishes take a back seat to unnecessary subplots that drag down the movie.
9509	4	a	The picture lacks the mix of innocence and savagery that branded [Smith's] other films.
9510	8	a	This one's a dog, all right.
9511	3	a	The general sense of blandness and predictability that marks the story's progression does not damage its emotional strengths. We feel for these characters and, because we care about them, we yearn for the highs the film ultimately delivers.
9512	0	a	The script, the direction and the performances work in concert like a souped-up muscle car.
9513	2	a	Matt Damon, a master of the ordinary, can create a rounded, convincing and utterly engaging character out of just about anyone, Benjamin Mee included.
9514	1	a	So fun and so funny.
9515	3	a	Cate Blanchett and Rooney Mara deliver remarkable performances in this impressive period piece
9516	3	a	Christian Bale is heroic in the way he allows the character to leap joyfully into despicability; there is no instinct for self-preservation here, and that is one mark of a good actor.
9517	3	a	What it borrows and what it builds combine to feel original and strange.
9518	3	a	A sharp, even amusing, homage to comic book lore, a great family-friendly action-comedy, and a thoughtful marital drama all wrapped up in a deliciously exciting package.
9519	4	a	"It's meant to make us ask, ""All right, what comes after?"" But it leaves real Eastwood fans only wondering, ""Okay -- what comes next?"
9520	4	a	A fat, juicy cherry on top of a memorably madcap trilogy.
9521	1	a	Adds a hefty amount of complexity with dazzling animation, an abundant amount of creativity, and a mature story that will wreck you like its main character.
9522	3	a	OK, they botched the title. But not the movie itself.
9523	3	a	Miss Pfeiffer, who looks utterly ravishing in outfits that set the teeth on edge, turns Angela's plight into something funny, but she seems eminently sane even when the movie does not.
9524	4	a	One suspects that the most memorable moments occurred off-camera.
9525	1	a	"Allen's new ""Midnight in Paris"" is a lot like his earlier, funnier movies. And it's far and away his sunniest effort since ""Mighty Aphrodite."
9526	6	a	"Much has been made over the years about Abrams' ""mystery box,"" a storytelling model of pure tease. In the case of The Cloverfield Paradox, it's just a fancy word for ""junk drawer."
9527	3	a	As usual, DeMille megaphones his direction to let us know where we've been, where we are and where we're going, but this is marvellous entertainment, nevertheless.
9528	5	a	"Valkyrie"" is an anachronistic movie that wants to be less than it should be."
9529	3	a	For anyone who has struggled to fit in, Diary of a Wimpy Kid is full of nostalgic and painful reminders of the horrors of middle school, from gym class to school plays. It's full of genuine laughs, one of the rare films that can by enjoyed by kids and adu
9530	3	a	Hits the screen running and never lets up.
9531	5	a	Slow and spurious.
9532	3	a	It's as if someone's taken the American Dream, lashed it to a table and cut it open to see how it works. An uncomfortable process, to be sure, but an awfully compelling one, too.
9533	0	a	Broomfield ends up exploring a world that cares more about money and deals than about life and death.
9534	4	a	Let's not mince words; The Tourist is one of the most outstandingly atrocious films of the year.
9535	7	a	It's sad and depressing when in order to get a laugh a Hollywood movie has to stoop to replaying gags that would have made the Three Stooges blush.
9536	3	a	Weinstein deliberately underplays the emotions of the story, preferring to sit back and observe the Hasidic community and Menashe's place in it.
9537	7	a	This is a movie that longs to be naughty, but never knows how to go far enough to truly surprise.
9538	5	a	By turns violent and brooding, it's stronger on style than on substance, but genre fans might find it at least sporadically amusing.
9539	4	a	It is a movie of remarkable performances.
9540	3	a	It's fun. That's all.
9541	3	a	What saves the movie is that Crowe isn't afraid of emotion. He's always willing to follow surprising new developments to see how they make his characters feel, and the result of that is almost always entertaining.
9542	2	a	A comedy satire as proudly silly as its awful title.
9543	6	a	Saturated with vengeance, betrayal, and melodrama, Mel Gibson's sadistic take on Jesus' final twelve hours screams bloody murder.
9544	5	a	An interesting cast and premise that feels like a missed opportunity. [Full review in Spanish]
9545	1	a	Penelope Cruz is a treat for the eyes, and so is her latest film, Pedro Almodovar's sizzlingly sexy film noir Broken Embraces, a love letter to the magical power of movies to mend broken hearts.
9546	4	a	The movie turns into another case of stupid people doing stupid things no real person in their right mind would do.
9547	5	a	It doesn't work as a revealing look at relationships or as a consistently funny comedy about the war between the sexes.
9548	1	a	It's got an amazing score by Miles Davis, photography by one of France's best cinematographers and Jeanne Moreau in a cloud of love, pain and desperation.
9549	3	a	Twisted, tense and trashy, it's glorious fun.
9550	5	a	This studio version is, oddly enough, far less commercial and only about a quarter as lushly mysterious as the superior overseas original. 
9551	5	a	Don't say I didn't warn you.
9552	9	a	When a movie sets out to be awful and achieves its goal, does that make it a success?
9553	1	a	"Gripping in its unsentimental clarity of vision, startling in its portentous ruminations on belief, sacrifice, and nature, ""First Reformed"" is unsparing even as it spares, a cinematic jolt of agony and transcendence."
9554	5	a	The final insult is saved for the end credits: 'Special Thanks to Mary Shelley.'
9555	5	a	There is a good movie to be made about the difficulties parents have in letting go of their children. Actually, Ron Howard already made that movie. It was called Parenthood and it starred Steve Martin.
9556	3	a	Jim Jarmusch, the king of indie cool, strikes another blow against the empire...
9557	3	a	all honours finally go to Veber, who has once again single-handedly changed the landscape of gay filmmaking, proving that gay subject matter can be financially successful without being condescending.
9558	6	a	"Paris Can Wait"" feels more like a cinematic adaptation of a Frommer's travel guide than an actual movie."
9559	5	a	If you can follow the plotlines of this swingeing approximation of the well-known video game of the same name, you are a better customer for John Moore's spectacular thriller than I was.
9560	7	a	Presumably Mr. Shamir's film plays differently in Israel. In the United States, it feels like just another day on the Op-Ed page.
9561	6	a	No doubt Roger Corman's version was worse, but it was probably more entertaining.
9562	4	a	A road movie with a lofty message that too frequently gets lost in its own thematic barrens. Whereas Krakauer's disturbing book sticks with you, Penn's movie, wrapped in the balloon of its fanciful rhetoric, just floats off.
9563	5	a	The thought behind this body-splattering nostalgia trip is unformed and stagnant.
9564	2	a	Backbeat is a tragedy for sure, but it's a tragedy with one hell of a soundtrack.
9565	4	a	... a guilty pleasure.
9566	10	a	Expects the audience to enjoy the prospect of a beleaguered white man suffering at the hands of a smug, self-righteous black man who never owns up to what he's done, never gets his comeuppance, and is rewarded in the end with a badge.
9567	2	a	full review at Movies for the Masses
9568	5	a	A too-clever-by-half attempt to both satirize and celebrate the superhero genre.
9569	1	a	It makes Euroflash metro thrillers like Luc Besson's Subway look about as serious as a ride on Disneyland's monorail.
9570	5	a	'Alpha and Omega' enters the crowded marketplace with little to say for itself. 
9571	5	a	While the movie is set in L.A., the rules of justice appear exaggerated to the point where the film seems to be taking place in a different country, but it doesn't really matter. It would be great fun just to put up your feet and watch director Peter Hyam
9572	6	a	The mildly amusing buddy/action comedy is more over-the-top Lawrence fare.
9573	2	a	Not as funny as their previous efforts but this is probably Edgar Wright, Simon Pegg and Nick Frost's most confident and well-conceived film yet. 
9574	3	a	Be warned that there are some images which might alarm the under-tens. But everyone else should be richly entertained.
9575	3	a	Gravity-defying and gorgeous.
9576	1	a	This film is a blast, full of pointed commentary and satire, though never sacrificing the fun factor. 
9577	3	a	"One of the cleverest and most darkly comic ""Final Destinations,"" with several fun deaths. And, yes, ""fun"" is the word."
9578	5	a	Ultimately the film refuses to bust out of the conventional rom com template. Its plot is face-punchingly implausible, its characters straitjacketed by stereotype, and its humour terminally planted in extreme awkwardness and feeble frat-boy crassness. 
9579	3	a	Even with wooden acting and dreadful dialogue, the action-packed charms of Fast Five cannot be denied.
9580	3	a	It ends on a cheerful note, free of sentimentality, which is true to the film's careful mixture of big laughs and meaningful drama.
9581	3	a	What appears to be an amusing tale of a leader who has lost his way is also an unapologetic challenge to faith itself.
9582	3	a	There are scenes here that make the most lachrymose TV movie weepie seem restrained by comparison. Nonetheless, you can't help but admire the film's full blown approach.
9583	6	a	With an arid landscape that is the spitting image of Utah, the tedious movie is about as much fun as a long stroll through a hot Utah desert without benefit of water.
9584	6	a	But while he reduces them to moving Barbie dolls, Ozon clearly loves his women. Or, as much as a catty drag queen can.
9585	10	a	Cross a certain line, and message overwhelms medium, substance overwhelms style, what you have to say drowns out how you might be saying it.
9586	5	a	The movie sags whenever Kline is offscreen, and when he's on screen, his presence and his character take over completely -- something that the filmmakers, and certainly Dano, did not intend.
9587	6	a	Kilmer's persona is strong, and he brings a certain energy to the screen, but he does nothing to make John Holmes any more interesting than the dope addict of the week on 'NYPD Blue.'
9588	2	a	If nothing else, watch it for Javier Bardem, who is rapidly establishing himself as among the world's very best at his craft
9589	3	a	Irreverent dramedy about revenge deals with abuse. 
9590	5	a	A nice enough picture, but it's also slow and meandering. Watching it is like seeing a decent Family Channel movie, except in this case you have to pay for it.
9591	0	a	Extraordinary.
9592	2	a	A love letter to silent cinema, Michel Hazanavicius' black-and-white non-talkie is a shallow but hellaciously enjoyable voyage into the past.
9593	3	a	Carol is a complex human story about unspoken desire, social expectations and an authentic life.
9594	4	a	It is also mildly troubling that the female characters are so passive.
9595	3	a	Very entertaining... refreshing.
9596	7	a	Fun, though more than a little trying.
9597	3	a	Cage and Herzog have created a superbly memorable lead character, and if the plot itself is curiously unmemorable, certain images will stay with you to the grave...
9598	3	a	A must see that will spark conversations and please the viewing audience. 
9599	3	a	It's rare that movies are made with such devotion to detail, even if the details are more frivolous than significant.
9600	5	a	A very moderate adventure.
9601	9	a	Doesn't build to anything substantial, instead dragging along interminably while its sense of humor succumbs to heat exhaustion...a gorgeous picture, but its soullessness wears down the viewing experience.
9602	3	a	Thanks to Beatrix Christian's beautiful screenplay, what was once a story about the way men and women communicate has grown into a haunting study of Australian race relations and gender dynamics.
9603	9	a	A Jaws ripoff no less ludicrous than Orca-Killer Whale... not only silly but narratively muddy and visually murky.
9604	4	a	Not trusting the audience to have any reaction that has not been completely stage-managed, [Hall and Daldry] lay on the sentimentality and the cliches as thick as they can, which is pretty thick.
9605	2	a	Its pastoral ambitions compensate for its lack of finesse.
9606	6	a	"Sad to say, ""The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey"" is a pale shadow trying to reach the sun on the strength of the ""Lord of the Rings"" trilogy."
9607	4	a	Those who are unfamiliar with Asimov's work may enjoy I, Robot as a summer popcorn movie. It's just unfortunate that it's not more.
9608	9	a	Hugely disappointing, painfully unfunny comedy that completely wastes its talented cast and then compounds the misery with a dismal script.
9609	5	a	It may not make you walk out, but it certainly left me unsatisfied.
9610	4	a	while [Roman Coppola] scores points for style, he staggers in terms of story.
9611	9	a	This is one of the worst scripts in the history of major-studio motion pictures: inconsistent, undeveloped, predictable, poorly thought-out -- hopeless on every level.
9612	3	a	Bond returns for more racy, action-packed thrills.
9613	4	a	Uneven but undeniably powerful.
9614	5	a	With a plot that is at once needlessly complicated and maddeningly careless, the movie veers unsteadily between farce and crime drama and never really engages the viewer.
9615	4	a	Though this sequel probably has more creative energy than its predecessor, the constant stream of one-liners and sight gags is very much hit or miss.
9616	3	a	"Almost everyone growing up believes their family must look like ""The Addams Family"" to everyone looking in... ""My Big Fat Greek Wedding"" comes from the heart..."
9617	0	a	A Christmas classic. Jim Varney is sorely missed in my heart.
9618	6	a	[Garcia] lets the picture start to go soft in the middle, and teary melodrama floods in like water from a broken dam.
9619	5	a	An animated adventure that boasts the visual prowess of the best mainstream releases in the medium, yet the storytelling sensibility of a stoner nodding furiously mid toke at the Zeitgeist documentary playing on the TV.
9620	0	a	Haynes composes the film like a series of Edward Hopper paintings: elegant, beautifully calibrated shots that express the street-level loneliness of midcentury life.
9621	0	a	one of the most accomplished and important children's films ever made.
9622	4	a	A Million Ways to Die in the West is guaranteed to divide audiences, but it's a really solid comedy with more than enough laughs to offset its minor shortcomings.
9623	9	a	It is an extraordinary cinematic achievement to take a story combining pirate treasure, drug runners, killer sharks, an airplane crash, car chases and Jessica Alba in a bikini, and turn it into an exercise in tedium.
9624	1	a	"Perhaps ""Logan Lucky"" is best appreciated as a stealth commentary on tough times in America. It takes a director of Soderbergh's gifts to actually make that funny."
9625	4	a	Manages to be more fun than any movie with its outrageous carbon footprint has any right to be.
9626	5	a	Even Johnny Depp in quirk-overdrive can't save it, his slyly insincere performance eventually irritating as much as the sincerely stupid movie he's stuck in.
9627	6	a	It's hard not to compare, but Pixar's classy and imaginative films set the bar high, while movies like this aim too low.
9628	3	a	A world of bad men that's easy to get trapped in and impossible to escape from
9629	5	a	For those of us who cleave to the old-fashioned view that narratives should be vaguely penetrable, the film might as well be retitled Incoherent Vice.
9630	5	a	This is mostly weak stuff, with a timid and reactionary final message about how it's better to stay in your home town, rather than go for a big-city college education.
9631	0	a	As much as the film is about Bardem's even-keeled determination... it's also about Tommy Lee Jones' brilliantly characterized Texas sheriff, who, faced with a trail of blood like he's never seen, wonders if he's still a match for a changing world. 
9632	1	a	Pop culture fans will find something to love in this fun thrill ride.
9633	3	a	It's a gorgeous film, mourning the impossibility of being alive as it celebrates that which binds us, a conscious-rattling, viscera-stirring piece of art.
9634	2	a	The Infiltrator works best when it sticks to that strange moral grey area that everyone - regardless of their experience busting drug cartels - can relate to.
9635	0	a	Reminds us that movies can be lyrical as well as vulgar, ambitious as well as playful, brilliant as well as down and dirty -- just like Amadeus himself.
9636	4	a	Spielberg blows stuff up better than anyone -- he proves himself the maestro of that by-now-degraded game.
9637	4	a	Frances McDormand lets loose in a terrific new role as record producer, mother, and corrupter of curious girls.
9638	3	a	... you may just want to fast forward to the final tale.
9639	7	a	A tired exercise in scatology, a film laced with enough poop, piss and penis joke to last you a lifetime.
9640	3	a	It's disturbing and creepy, but it's hands down the best female performance I've seen this year.
9641	5	a	The big Baker clan goes for a vacation at a Wisconsin lake, and we get drowned in a sea of slapstick and schmaltz...but it's actually an improvement on its predecessor.
9642	0	a	Thanks to this brave and gutsy actress' overwhelming candor and sincerity, you go away feeling educated, enlightened and more compassionate than you can possibly imagine.
9643	1	a	Perfectly built French tickler.
9644	4	a	Wounded and enigmatic, Eminem is a worthy focus.
9645	4	a	Too much of the movie feels predestined---down to the rainstorm on opening day---and subplots involving budding romance end up forcing what's implicit.
9646	3	a	The best horror film since 'The Sixth Sense,' 'The Changeling' and 'Psycho'...with a timely Halloween release, it's an eerie, enigmatic scare story about a supernatural videotape. Sure, it's an implausible gimmick movie - but how gullible are you? I suspe
9647	6	a	There are bound to be very few surprises in a movie that gives away its ending in the title.
9648	0	a	Fun DeMille full of spectacle and flashy stars...and a great train wreck.
9649	0	a	All of it works. None of it is wasted. Bad Genius is literally flawless.
9650	6	a	Below water, these cretins have to keep their yaps shut, and you can concentrate on the film's true features: Some beautiful photography and the real treasure -- Alba's booty.
9651	4	a	It's all kind of silly and amorphous, but the scenes between Yi and Cera, whether or not they were scripted, have a babes-in-the-wood loveliness.
9652	5	a	How to turn an innocuous comic strip into an obnoxious movie.
9653	6	a	Too often the filmmakers insult the audience's intelligence with far-fetched plot points, not to mention an offensive stereotyping of Mooseport's residents as moronic local yokels.
9654	7	a	All the narrative easy lifting does not help the emotional gut punch that the film thinks it's set you up for.
9655	1	a	I hate to trot out this idea -- it's too close to the moronic 'they don't make 'em like they used to' -- but this is the type of film it would be hard to put together today.
9656	2	a	Fast Five is among the best fourth sequels ever - not exactly high praise but more than I expected to dish out.
9657	5	a	You'd think after an eight-year absence from the screen, [Streisand would] return with more self-respect.
9658	6	a	[Contains] tin-earned dialogue and haphazard plotting ...
9659	3	a	A far better film than is usually thought.
9660	3	a	A surefire heart-tugger made with skill and judgment.
9661	4	a	Disappointing and uneven
9662	3	a	Exhaustive biography this is not. But in focusing on Brown's rise and heyday and with Boseman faultlessly capturing his groove, you can't fail to have yourself a funky time.
9663	2	a	Suspenseful.
9664	4	a	Newcomer Kyle Stanger, who was just five when the movie was made, gives Lumpy so much personality and charm that every child will want a heffalump playmate of of his own.
9665	2	a	Essentially a filmed play, but McConaughey's performance is too good to ignore. 
9666	10	a	What Carol captures more specifically than the thrill of a romantic encounter is the act of remembering only to forget.
9667	3	a	As a musical look at family, generational and cultural conflict, and faith, Fiddler on the Roof makes a virtue of its quaintness... [Blu-ray]
9668	9	a	Writer-director Malcolm D. Lee wraps a soft and gooey message in a thick crust of crass slapstick.
9669	5	a	It makes some good points, but ultimately just stops rather than ends.
9670	9	a	Elijah Wood, Rose Leslie, Michael Caine and Diesel are all wasted -- and so is our time.
9671	6	a	...the result is a sometimes amusing, mild mannered philosophical comedy that is, in the end, shallow.
9672	7	a	Black or White seems manufactured to show why an alcoholic white man is always better than triflin' ass black people.
9673	2	a	This tonally buoyant coming-of-age film works as both an off-kilter comedy and a potent drama.
9674	6	a	The script lurches from banal formula ... to vacuous, cringe-worthy contrivance.
9675	4	a	Although slightly convoluted and disjointed, Jacob's Ladder is a hypnotic psychological thriller that makes use of its fuzzy orientation. An exceptionally odd and captivating drama that will leave one scratching their head
9676	4	a	What saves things from becoming entirely dreary is its cast ... 
9677	5	a	The movie is barely stenciled as a story. The romance never gains enough focus or momentum to make its crisis even comically involving.
9678	1	a	One part comedy, one part thriller, Kontroll is a film that's tough to pin down but easy to like.
9679	6	a	Essentially the film aims to trade in the awkwardness of teen sexuality, but too often settles for the gross-out gag instead.
9680	4	a	It is beautiful to watch until it jumps off the rails and goes over the top.
9681	0	a	Ultimately, it's a tribute to the power of cinema.
9682	2	a	A pleasant romantic comedy.
9683	6	a	Cradle boasts a couple of bravura fight and chase scenes but they're stranded amid the predictable and the pedestrian.
9684	4	a	"James Brown and B.B. King anchor this footnote in boxing history, but the film peaks near the midpoint with Bill Withers' truly soulful performance of ""Hope She'll Be Happier."
9685	2	a	Patently absurd and yet wildly entertaining; a marked improvement over its excessively dour predecessor.
9686	4	a	The real stars of the film are Francois Emmanuelli's vibrant production design, Klapisch's flair with inventive optical effects and above all Barcelona itself, captured here in all its baroque brilliance.
9687	4	a	An effective and frequently satisfying indulgence, but not nearly as much as the book was.
9688	7	a	Moore's only non-docu is a misfire, a diffuse, unfunny political satire that only John Candy's most avid fans might enjoy.
9689	4	a	...a by-the-numbers tale that will have a great following by its ready-made fan base
9690	3	a	Onscreen cigarette smoking is as incessant as April's discontent--the period prop that becomes a running gag. A more important choke point, though, is dim audience involvement.
9691	0	a	Phenomenal, magnificent, exuberantly entertaining, and just about any other positive adjective you can think of.
9692	3	a	An efficient laughing machine and a visually appealing film. [Full review in Spanish]
9693	5	a	Very sordid and unexpectedly dull; adults only.
9694	6	a	This movie swerves from fantasy to nightmare. It doesn't feel like the story a wife and mother would volunteer to tell about herself.
9695	3	a	Absurd yet entertaining
9696	4	a	A political comedy with spunk that capitalizes on several bizarre trends in contemporary American politics.
9697	2	a	Subdued war drama on life on the home front during the Vietnam war.
9698	3	a	An uneven but ultimately winning coming-out story. It's one of those films where I can point out lots of flaws but then of them especially bother me 
9699	4	a	While unlikely to have anyone cheering in the stalls, St Trinian's is nowhere near the calamity it should have been, even if it comes within striking distance more than once.
9700	4	a	Suspense is apparently sustained by keeping the mountaineering info to a mum and making every character a moron.
9701	4	a	Visually stylish, thematically creepy.
9702	1	a	Exceptional...the effect is shattering.
9703	0	a	A masterpiece about the human condition.
9704	4	a	Maybe it would have been better for Seinfeld to make an animated movie about nothing.
9705	2	a	What a nice surprise to settle in for a fashion documentary and find a touching love story hidden within its glamorous folds.
9706	4	a	This biopic of Greene, a DJ most Brits will not know, has a limited appeal.
9707	1	a	The swiftest and sexiest modern thriller since The Thomas Crown Affair.
9708	9	a	A clone of the original. Clones in movies are not always a good thing. And this is proof.
9709	0	a	Pixar reinvents itself again with a rah-rah rally cry for the American family.
9710	1	a	"With the onset of the sublime Skyfall, Daniel Craig officially wrests the title of ""Best Bond Ever"" from Connery, the British bulldog delivers a brilliant, bulldozing performance in a cinematic spectacular more streamlined than one of his Tom Ford suits."
9711	6	a	"There's a thin line between the iconic and the generic, and ""The Rover,"" a grim post-apocalyptic drama from down under, wanders back and forth across it in an adrenaline daze."
9712	5	a	Under Joel Zwick's lackluster direction, the humor mostly comes across as too broad or simply flat.
9713	0	a	Vertigo stands as one of the thrill master's most psychologically dense and twisted works in which obsession, commitment, and dual identities all merge to create a voluptuous tale of thwarted love.
9714	0	a	A disturbing account of Earth being thrown into the fan from a master filmmaker ready to take the darkness of our existence to places we may not be ready to confront.
9715	8	a	This cop comedy is charged with an inane script, an unrealistic setup and brutally unfunny gags.
9716	9	a	If I told you that your children DESERVED this movie, you'd slap my face.
9717	6	a	Don't allow the ending to ruin the film. Ignore it.
9718	5	a	Designed only for the youngest of children, who might be roused by the silly action, or perhaps for John Hughes, who might delight in the fact that his influence continues to color the landscape.
9719	5	a	The dance sequences themselves are looking less fresh this time around.
9720	1	a	conveys a real sense of danger, both emotional and physical
9721	4	a	The screenplay relies too much on the first level of its premise and doesn't push into unexpected places.
9722	3	a	House of Flying Daggers is the rare film that inspires audiences to suspend a sense of reality and allow themselves to be transported, as if under a spell, to an alternate, fantastic world.
9723	6	a	"Any critic who complained about the lack of story in ""Where the Wild Things Are"" should be forced to watch the escapades and high jinks of ""Astro Boy"" on a loop until they realize that activity is not to be confused with actual storytelling."
9724	9	a	Life, death, the beyond... Ah, the beyond. Such a minefield for respectable filmmakers.
9725	3	a	Fonda looks sensational and glides through this romp like a dazed, ripe-to-the- touch innocent.
9726	3	a	"American Hustle"" is what might result if a movie snorted cocaine."
9727	0	a	Combines in an almost unique balance Hitchcock's brash flair for psychological shocks with his elegant genius for dapper stylishness.
9728	5	a	...nothing more than an endless festival of blood and gore, masquerading under the guise of a gritty modern science fiction fable.
9729	7	a	Ten years and three films deep, the loose trilogy is a case study in marketing, a portrait of how the noise around a franchise starts to matter more than the movies that form the franchise.
9730	3	a	Moore turns Alzheimer's drama into acting master class.
9731	5	a	Features serious over-acting, lousy effects, appalling dialogue, misplaced and ill-advised romantic interludes, a complete lack of tension, nothing to link the story set in the past with the section set in the present and very bad wigs.
9732	7	a	A bit of a guilty pleasure. But, most of the humor falls flat. Interesting that it's a Vince Vaughn vehicle that doesn't give Vaughn enough to do. Paul Chambers, CNN.
9733	1	a	One of the year's best films.
9734	6	a	If you took a Weekly World News cover story and tried to reverse-engineer a screenplay from the headline, it might look something like The Skin I Live In.
9735	3	a	The interplay between the Green Hornet and straight man Kato delights, overshadowing Cameron Diaz as a mutual love interest.
9736	2	a	A film that fascinates even as it goes wildly overboard.
9737	6	a	This is not a film that stings, lasts or moves - it's just a nice indie movie at the end of the day.
9738	6	a	The actors capably hit their marks but rarely illuminate the interior torment of Roth's prose. The direction and cinematography are similarly workmanlike but unremarkable.
9739	2	a	...basks in a kind of golden mythic glow that isn't often seen in movies anymore, making it a film that's hard for anyone but the most flint nosed to resist.
9740	4	a	Still quite effective stalker-thriller, has dated somewhat
9741	9	a	We have to assume, even hope, that a movie this bad will finally wring the death knell for found footage horror... but sadly we'd probably be wrong.
9742	0	a	Hilarious and enormously entertaining.
9743	4	a	For Black Snake Moan to work any sort of magic, it must be viewed as a blues riff on damaged souls and their desperate need for salvation.
9744	3	a	Inspiring and impassioned, delivering Rev. Dr. King's reverberating message of perserverance.
9745	3	a	Easily one of the most important and relevant films of the year.
9746	3	a	This should convince the holdouts to scrap their VCRs and get with the DVDs.
9747	3	a	A deeply spiritual movie about the moral complexities of helping another person, opening one's heart, feeling the pain of another, and letting go of the need to fix that person but instead to simply be present in love.
9748	4	a	Not nearly curious enough.
9749	4	a	Considering Bond gets disguised as an ape, a crocodile and a clown, the film has a lot more to be embarrassed about than its title.
9750	5	a	Another bittersweet film about boys growing up and demystifying women that disappointingly short-changes its female characters.
9751	5	a	Good with mechanics, bad with people, the film moves its one-dimensional characters around like stick figures in the service of a story whose outcome is hardly in doubt.
9752	0	a	A major work, a masterpiece.
9753	8	a	Had the filmmakers deliberately set out to insult, demean, and trample upon Lee and Kirby's legacy, they could hardly have done a more efficient job.
9754	4	a	Feel free to turn off your brain and let these zombies munch on it for a while.
9755	6	a	A Perfect Getaway, a more scenic than scary movie about a couple whose Hawaiian honeymoon goes horribly wrong, takes a long time to get where it's going.
9756	3	a	The Bourne Identity is no mere summer amusement park ride. It's as gray as Go was colorful and a cool contrast to its source material.
9757	9	a	A childish film written from a grade school perspective with neither quality nor excitement.
9758	3	a	It's the Douglas formula and it works.
9759	1	a	Not, maybe, the most rigorous of Christmas Carol adaptations, although it is a lot more faithful than one would perhaps have expected... at any rate a great Muppet film.
9760	5	a	More subtlety is required, as this annoying urge to tie up all loose ends makes for a distinctly cold conclusion, and one that sadly undoes much of the good work achieved in the opening act.
9761	3	a	If you see only one James Cameron-directed movie about theTitanic -and you should - see the one that doesn't star Kate and Leo.
9762	0	a	It's a sign of the movie's complexity that John Wayne, often typecast, is given a tortured, conflicted character to play.
9763	2	a	There's rarely a dull moment, but the movie doesn't descend into cartoonish action/violence like most action movies do these days...
9764	6	a	Should convince studios that banking on computer-weaned kids to actually leave their keyboards to venture out of the house and pay for a movie was, is and will remain a bad idea.
9765	5	a	Iyt's a cheesy kids-to-the-rescue adventure that should soar in popularity when it's released on DVD.
9766	4	a	Calculatedly audience-pleasing, there's nevertheless plenty here to enjoy for forgiving punters, especially Gadon's lovely performance.
9767	4	a	Killer Joe may be a great film, but it's not a particularly good one.
9768	5	a	Couples Retreat leaves a good cast stranded without a script, although the cast isn't in much of a position to complain.
9769	7	a	A thoroughly misconceived mishmash of pop attitude, nostalgia and James Bond-style gadgetry turns the fondly remembered Western TV series into a monumental misfire of a summer action movie.
9770	3	a	...an excellent alternative to the usual summer barrage of big budget actioners. I hope the tweenies that should see do see it.
9771	5	a	The cast perform strongly, especially the charismatic Drameh and Charlie Creed-Miles as a cabbie trying to adopt a child, but the material lets them down; a melodramatic climax is particularly embarrassing.
9772	5	a	Gooding offers a desperately ingratiating performance.
9773	5	a	Devoted Trekkers will have to see it to keep abreast of the ships' logs, but Saturday night at the flicks fun-seekers are apt to concur this one only fires on stun.
9774	1	a	Basically every great, good and decent war movie rolled into one amazing must-see spectacle.
9775	4	a	[McAvoy is] perfectly fine as the prickly metropolitan exiled to the provinces after a dust-up at a London law school.
9776	1	a	This movie is almost hypnotically weird, and I liked it for that very reason. Not everyone will.
9777	6	a	Packaged as a rollicking political comedy, writer-director Barry Levinson's much-ballyhooed reunion with Robin Williams wobbles unsteadily between broad humor and paranoid thrills. The result is a bland muddle.
9778	2	a	Perceptively plaintive, recalling our Native American ethnic tragedy, made timely by the current agitation at Standing Rock.
9779	4	a	Crimson Peak is a disappointment because it doesn't have a particularly interesting plot nor does its characters end up being too charismatic, even if it does show the visual inventivness of Del Toro. [Full Review in Spanish]
9780	4	a	It is a hopeful romantic melodrama which hits all the right notes of an optimistic post-WWII America obsessed with its own virtuousness. 
9781	1	a	It's not just about growing up, it's the kind of movie that helps you grow up.
9782	4	a	Clumsy, innocent, awkward, to be sure, but it's never skimpy on the fun.
9783	4	a	a decent sci-fi'er more interesting for its characters than its plot...shows its roots in television from its visual composition to some cheesy effects
9784	6	a	Its approach is often amusing and even easy to relate to from time to time and the performances from the entire cast are comedically and emotionally rewarding, but the central character gets on your last nerve and nearly ruins a pleasurable experience. 
9785	5	a	"Welcome to Mooseport"" is a well worn story about the rich and powerful versus the average Joe, with a love interest tossed in, and does nothing new."
9786	6	a	For at least half of its length, it's an Astro Bore.
9787	3	a	Honors the affectless beauty of the original anime art and maintains the outlaw boppiness of the series concept.
9788	1	a	For all their horsing around, the truth is Wright is an accomplished filmmaker who embeds story in the very mechanics of cinema.
9789	2	a	Just when you think Whedon has fallen into the generic action film void, he injects Serenity with a dose of feeling...
9790	4	a	If I can't say I'm looking forward to the next one, neither can I ignore the medicinal properties of Pooh's latest big-screen outing.
9791	0	a	This is a movie made by a man who knew how something felt, and found a way to evoke it in us.
9792	3	a	Clint Eastwood's gentle, thoughtful film about the fragility of life and the promise of a life beyond.
9793	2	a	Will the big-screen 'Veronica Mars' leave its devoted Marshmallows hungry for s'more? It's a pretty good bet.
9794	4	a	Really not as bad as the title; it IS Polanski
9795	4	a	"McGuigan - whose previous films include ""Victor Frankenstein"" and ""Lucky Number Slevin"" - seems like a bit of a hack, particularly when it comes to his on-the-nose music choices."
9796	5	a	A more fitting title for Memoirs of a Geisha would have been Cliffs Notes of a Geisha.
9797	0	a	The film zigs and zags, chasing after many different characters. And that sprawl, the rogue's gallery of strays, cheaters and deceivers, activates the film rather than deflates it.
9798	9	a	... the movie is a well-meaning, vaporous bore, enlivened only by occasional traces of Showgirls-style camp and plasticine tears trickling down impeccably powdered cheeks.
9799	3	a	Though boasting strong, Oscar-caliber turns from DiCaprio, Winslet, and Michael Shannon, Mendes' second dissection of suburbia is too studied and deliberate in the first acts before generating emotional power, and may suffer in comparison to TV's Mad Men.
9800	3	a	It features a gloriously nuanced movie star performance from Hailee Steinfeld and a host of strong supporting turns in service of Kelly Fremon Craig's thoughtful and often hilarious comedic drama. 
9801	6	a	Weintrob's stylish visuals mimic Web technologies, which succeed in making his characters seem all the more removed from reality. Now if someone would find a way to equip theater seats with a 'delete' key, we could be rid of them completely.
9802	1	a	The stars of this fowl adventure also have hilarious foibles, eccentric habits, diverse personalities and a lot of spunk.
9803	6	a	A generic hash of contrived comedy, romance, and tragedy, the saddest part of which is that a way-cool, high-end riding lawn mower winds up at the bottom of someone's swimming pool.
9804	2	a	Brings a lot of talent and a tremendous amount of craft to a movie that will be too painful for most people to endure. 
9805	0	a	"The fact that ""Savages"" looks at an ordinary and often inevitable part of life shouldn't obscure the fact that this is a beautifully written and wonderfully played film, capturing the nuances of family dynamics as assuredly as any film I've seen in quite"
9806	9	a	It would have been better for all concerned if this 'Case' had remained closed.
9807	0	a	deliberately provocative, and more than challenging even with Shamir's wry approach, it's paradigm shifting and disconcerting
9808	3	a	Captures that certain romantic Jane Austen-esque spirit.
9809	4	a	The film doesn't just shout 'vote for me' it screams it so loudly and desperately it practically drowns out Robert Downey Jnr's decent performance and the film's saving grace.
9810	3	a	This is not a subtle film. It's not even unpredictable. But it is an awful lot of ghoulish, melodramatic fun.
9811	0	a	The only summer movie that matters this year... Land of the Dead is Romero's long-awaited masterpiece...
9812	10	a	Worse than you can imagine.
9813	3	a	Woman Walks Ahead has some narrative issues but is ultimately a well-acted biographical drama.
9814	9	a	This is the gang that couldn't test straight... What's needed here is not a run-in with ETS, but with Freddy Krueger or Jason Voorhees.
9815	3	a	Crisp, stylish and well-acted English-language adaptation. Rooney Mara rocks this role.
9816	6	a	Impressively stylish but curiously empty.
9817	4	a	"Because of [the] parallels to our own tumultuous society, I will call the makers of ""The Darkest Minds"" prescient observers of our time."
9818	4	a	A sweet, slick, streamlined yet, ultimately, forgettable ploy in the game of love
9819	2	a	If Herzog had chosen realism over surrealism, this film would have been predictable and unentertaining. As it is, I found it oddly captivating. This is one weird movie.
9820	4	a	Pokes gently at the funny bone and is sympathetic without becoming sentimental.
9821	3	a	Matt Damon's an amnesiac secret agent on the run in this immensely satisfying and engagingly direct thriller.
9822	5	a	Those unsure of what a scruffy nerfherder is or what the planet Kashyyyk represents in the broader Star Wars universe will probably want to sit this one out.
9823	4	a	This terrifically tuneful movie offers a fascinating taste of musical history, with Beyonce just fine as Etta James.
9824	3	a	[Grant and Bullock] are so good together that you can easily imagine them doing this again, a la Tracy and Hepburn, in another flimsy concoction.
9825	3	a	Humorously shows how a parent in second childhood helps his immature son grow up quickly.
9826	4	a	A charming, banter-filled comedy... one of those airy cinematic bon bons whose aims -- and by extension, accomplishments -- seem deceptively slight on the surface.
9827	6	a	Eat Pray Love is like an overstuffed lightweight suitcase, with little room for us to feel the emotional connections Liz makes with new friends along the way.
9828	3	a	A well-made spectacle that makes up for overall lacking story and character development with one incredible action scene after the next.
9829	0	a	My choice as the funniest of Hope and Crosby's Road pictures. It is definitely the zaniest.
9830	3	a	A showcase for DiCaprio and Winslet's formidable talents, and they are up to the challenge of playing tortured, well intentioned but ultimately doomed victims of dashed dreams.
9831	4	a	An agreeable but ultimately insubstantial piece of fluff.
9832	4	a	[Demi Moore is] She's one reason to see writer-director's Derrick Borte's zeitgeist fable The Joneses. Though she's not the only one.
9833	3	a	Charming, bittersweet coming-of-age nostalgia
9834	4	a	For the most part, the film races boldly past this material, but it never quite transcends it. Still, it's good fun while the clock is ticking back and forth.
9835	0	a	Knocked Up is a different kind of movie, a refreshing mix of the whip smart and the heartfelt.
9836	2	a	The movie encourages us to share Schreck's unfettered delight as he watches his own filmed images with the knowledge that this is a man who cannot see himself in the mirror.
9837	4	a	Flightplan is another one of those thrillers with a clever setup that, once all the cards are laid out and the plan is revealed in full, completely collapses.
9838	4	a	A bizarre and downcast road flick best described as Thelma and Louise meets Natural Born Killers, only with a lot less flash and a lot more lesbianism.
9839	3	a	The combination of a brilliant lead performance and a respectably honest portrayal of Alzheimer's make Still Alice affecting, even during the times when it feels as though it needs a little more plot. 
9840	1	a	...painstakingly unbiased, painting Kennedy as an egotistical, arrogant, selfish, blackguard who cared only for himself and his family name and whose cowardice directly caused Mary Jo's death. Bruce Dern gives an award quality performance.
9841	4	a	Will the grandchildren of our grandchildren cherish our memory because we rose as one and did the right thing?
9842	1	a	This movie is soooooo good.
9843	5	a	...and introducing Pauly Shore.
9844	5	a	There's a lot the movie gets right, but fails completely when it tries, cinematically, to depict what schizophrenia is like
9845	5	a	Uninspired tale feels like a made-for-TV movie.
9846	0	a	A hugely enjoyable, frequently hilarious comedy with a brilliant script, an inspired premise, likeable characters and a star-making central performance from Aubrey Plaza.
9847	3	a	Midnight in Paris is light, quick and pleasant, the kind of movie that boomers, their parents and their kids will eat up like cheese fondue.
9848	3	a	'Midnight in Paris' is a dream Woody Allen, and most importantly you, won't want to wake up from.
9849	4	a	An inspirational story that is radically diminished by the calm acceptance of out of wedlock pregnancy of black high school students and the shameless promotion of abortion.
9850	0	a	It's as close to a perfect film as I've seen all year: ingeniously crafted, thematically consistent, and haunting in its implications.
9851	0	a	If there is a film that could be described as luscious, this is it.
9852	9	a	This mishmash of genres offers little.
9853	3	a	A rewarding- frustrating smart-silly comedy of pretentious- modest ambitions.
9854	4	a	There's not quite enough oomph to sustain this story into more chapters. Besides, it's hard to get excited about end-of-the-world scenarios when we see them playing out on the news.
9855	3	a	a dark and thrilling story that's all the more gripping because it's based on a true story
9856	5	a	Despite some astonishing visual sequences, a flimsy script and frankly awful character design ground this film before it can blast off.
9857	3	a	The Kings of Summer is the cinematic equivalent of an Arctic-cold popsicle on a Sahara-hot day. Refreshing and satisfying but not overly sentimental, the film taps into the frustrations of adolescence with warmth and wit.
9858	4	a	Mildly amusing Josh Hartnett sex comedy.
9859	3	a	At times, it's a bit too much like watching the Zapruder film, but... it keeps the audience sharp by forcing them to search for clues and stay focused on the action.
9860	3	a	In the incendiary performance by Rooney Mara, one of the year's best, you have all the incentive you need to drag out the Dragon Tattoo gun yet again.
9861	6	a	Beautiful on the outside, but empty within.
9862	4	a	"Viewed through the prism of the recession, ""Larry Crowne"" is a perversely upbeat training film for discarded, obsolete, over-the-hill workers."
9863	8	a	Using ancient languages, vivid images and visceral violence, Gibson has brought new life to one of civilization's oldest narratives.
9864	9	a	Ill-conceived and ill-timed, this unfunny yuppies' lament couldn't be more insulting to single parents, women, or anyone struggling to make a living. Excuse me while I cry as success ruins the characters' perfect lives.
9865	4	a	Tighter, funnier, and generally better than its predecessor
9866	4	a	Unfortunately, while their performances are intriguing at best, they all appear to be misplaced in this biographical drama. Blame it largely on shoddy writing and direction by Peter Landesman, who appears to be out of his depth.
9867	0	a	Highly recommended.
9868	3	a	An elaborate puzzle box of a film that continuously confounds expectations in the grandest of ways.
9869	2	a	The emotional breadth of these performances makes the flow chart predictability tolerable.
9870	1	a	"Although ""Monster"" qualifies as a textbook Oscar-bait transformation ... [Charlize] Theron conveys the damaged-goods psychological pain behind Wuornos' shattered life ..."
9871	6	a	A soft, undernourished biography that plays things too safe.
9872	2	a	Great fun.
9873	2	a	Typical lifestyles of the ennui-ridden overprivileged, but there are moments of near brilliance and an ending that makes up for much.
9874	5	a	Too often writer/directors such as Light It Up's Craig Bolotin don't take the time to create a plausible plot and realistic dialog.
9875	3	a	Chuck and Buck, director Miguel Arteta and writer Mike White have crafted an insightful portrait of inertia, and offer a complex look at the fine line between victim and victimizer.
9876	3	a	Adam Scott takes the leading male role as Jason Fryman. Were such a thing possible, he looks like he could be the son of Tom Cruise and Michael Sheen, minus their celebrity baggage. 
9877	9	a	All Cold Creek Manor seems to be interested in, really, is packing as many people into the theatre as possible before word spreads and optimism is slain...again.
9878	1	a	It's, well, spellbinding.
9879	5	a	You've seen it all before. The only question is: Why haven't they?
9880	4	a	Law makes self-satisfaction beguiling, and in an odd way that's his, and the movie's, limitation.
9881	6	a	Flashy but skin-deep...all the sound and fury can't disguise the fact that Alpha Dog doesn't signify much.
9882	5	a	Stolid, uncinematic exercise in milking more cash from a nicely scored but mediocre Broadway hit.
9883	2	a	Gadon is lovely as the girl who grows to enjoy being called Lizzie, and it is satisfying to see her growing into her power as a woman and a monarch. 
9884	1	a	The movie should have been a masterpiece of mood and character, and it almost is, revolving as it does around two wonderful performances.
9885	2	a	A movie as delightful and silly - indeed, much more silly - than its similarly delightful predecessor.
9886	9	a	Maxwell has made the, shall we say interesting, decision to change [Stonewall Jackson]God's hellcat into a warm and fuzzy teddy bear.
9887	4	a	Viewers looking for a coherent narrative won't find it in this chaotic film.
9888	1	a	You could overdose on beauty at House of Flying Daggers.
9889	6	a	When all is said and done, the dog is the only thing you care about in Darling Companion.
9890	4	a	The film is elegiac and sad, beautifully mounted, but not as compelling as it should be.
9891	7	a	dull and lifeless, moving inertly from point to point without offering much that's memorable or amusing
9892	3	a	Into The Wild has been made into a prayer of a motion picture by Sean Penn. It may not touch everybody, but those whom it does touch, it will touch deeply. It is a haunting odyssey.
9893	4	a	Ordinary people don't generally go for Jarmusch's quirky films, and while this won't earn him a huge mainstream audience, it is accessible in a harmless, unpretentious way.
9894	7	a	You don't have to have a plot to have a good movie. But you do need decent editing, lighting, shot composition, and directorial vision. Shane Black's The Predator has none of the above.
9895	2	a	While it doesn't quite live up to its potential, it's still a heck of a lot funnier than what usually passes for comedy in these days.
9896	5	a	Compelling, yet dissappointing.
9897	4	a	John C. Reilly shows up as choleric man-child Taquito, and the funny begins to kick in.
9898	3	a	Yes, Julianne Moore will win the Oscar. And yes, this in one depressing film.
9899	6	a	Black Or White asks the right questions, but never gets around to answering them, instead finding itself caught up in stereotypes and cutesy storytelling that often feels like a Hallmark message.
9900	4	a	Director and co-writer Michael Showalter's script, especially in scenes about Doris's hoarding and the way her family relates to it, is slack, and the ending's a bit too pat. Still, it's fun to watch great actors do their thing.
9901	3	a	There is a special place in the satire hall of fame for any movie that can prompt public rebukes from both Matt Drudge and Sean Penn.
9902	0	a	They don't make noir films better than this.
9903	0	a	A disturbing film to say the least, and definitely one that could never have been made in the United States.
9904	1	a	"Payne and Dern find Modest Nobility in ""Nebraska"
9905	4	a	Using mostly unknown and first-time actors, Loach spins a passable coming-of-age tale, which should please his fans and provides a diversion for the rest of us.
9906	4	a	You are left in no doubt that the events shown onscreen never happened in this way, something the best biopics make you forget.
9907	6	a	Lee's movie is pleasant enough, but it's too swept up in the spirit it's celebrating to ask the relevant questions.
9908	3	a	Shaker furniture in movie form - stark, plain, conceived in austere and intelligent good taste; beautifully made, in fact, but maybe more designed for looking at than actually sitting on.
9909	4	a	What the film really has going for it is a good supporting cast. Actors playing von Stauffenberg's fellow conspirators include Bill Nighy, Kenneth Branagh and Terence Stamp.
9910	3	a	Not too surprisingly, Fincher doesn't bring his auteur A-game here, though his crafty B-game is better than most.
9911	5	a	Tom Dey directs with all the energy of a cook flipping burgers at Jack in the Box.
9912	6	a	The movie is a comedy, I guess. It looks sunny and it's played lightheartedly. But what's the point?
9913	6	a	The best thing you can say about this scattershot political satire is that the late John Candy's next-to-last picture is relatively funnier and less depressing than his valedictory Wagons East.
9914	3	a	For once, a movie does not proclaim the truth about two love-struck somebodies, but permits them time and space to convince us of that all on their own.
9915	0	a	In more ways than one, Bond is back.
9916	3	a	Cadillac Records lacks a center, yet it's an enjoyable ramble, with a feel for what made the early days of rock as wild as any that followed.
9917	1	a	The sophisticated humor of Peter Lord and Nick Park's very funny comedy is more likely to strike a nerve with adults.
9918	5	a	A muddle.
9919	3	a	For a while, Woodstock represented a spirit of peaceful sharing that sometimes makes America great. That's what this native-born writer and immigrant director want us to remember.
9920	6	a	The comedy trio returns in a lesser effort, funny, but not up to their previous successes. 
9921	4	a	Although not as disarmingly funny the second time around, inspired casting means that, unlike most in-laws, the Fockers don't outstay their welcome.
9922	3	a	Corbijn may tend to favour vague, vaporous stylings, but Hoffman brings focus that snaps the film out of somnabulism.
9923	1	a	Defines itself through sustained mood, otherworldly intrigue and deep, abiding humanism.
9924	6	a	French director Bertrand Bonello therefore deserves some kind of ignominious prize for turning his lengthy, stylish biopic into a veritable snoozer.
9925	3	a	... Broken Embraces is a well-written story of a love so precious it hurt.
9926	5	a	A few laughs here and there and a couple of moments of emotionally stunted sweetness add up to a Fanboys that only a fanboy would love.
9927	5	a	As great as Serkis is, he can't begin to make 'The Hobbit' look anything but short.
9928	5	a	A beautifully shot post-apocalyptic fever dream that might have worked as a short but is inconsequential as a feature film.
9929	7	a	We stand before a lazy piece of work that includes well established actors and avoids totally ridiculing itself because of its protagonist, Bruce Willis being tough, Kate Hudson showing off her beauty and an excellent soundtrack. [Full Review in Spanish]
9930	4	a	Perhaps destined to follow the same emotional arc as the true story it portrays, the film starts with great promise, passion, and inspiration only to quietly wane.
9931	1	a	A story that's so sweet and innocent, it's practically forgivable for being the awards bait it's being offered up as.
9932	3	a	The hottest couple to come down the pike recently has been Frodo and Sam. Hudson and McConaughey rate higher on the spark-o-meter.
9933	1	a	With an almost aching restraint in the performances and storytelling, Assassination makes for a quite enjoyable film if you give yourself over to its pacing and style.
9934	7	a	No. Just...no.
9935	4	a	There's a feel of authenticity about Alpha Dog, primarily because of the performances of the young actors.
9936	0	a	Wonderfully entertaining animation.
9937	4	a	Wristcutters is quite a bit darker than most mainstream romantic comedies. As you might not expect, it's also quite a bit more inventive and far wittier than most mainstream romantic comedies.
9938	4	a	Lightweight and a bit of a let-down, Sofia Coppola's follow-up to the marvelous Virgin Suicides is nevertheless an interesting development in what's shaping up to be an interesting career.
9939	7	a	If you weren't into Firefly before, Serenity gives no decent excuse to start now.
9940	0	a	Thirty years later, there are still rumblings of making another sequel, but no one would dare suggest a reboot or re-imagining; Ghostbusters is perfect exactly as it is.
9941	0	a	A witty and highly imaginative historical fiction, well adapted by screenwriter Peter Shaffer from his own hit play. [Blu-ray]
9942	3	a	If you sit back and enjoy the eye candy of the stars and locations, at least one cold winter night will actually fly by.
9943	1	a	If you want to take a trip to the stars, this is the rocket to ride.
9944	1	a	A well-realized and weirdly amusing animated treat.
9945	1	a	"Time and again this mad masterwork has you thinking, ""Oh, no, they wouldn't dare go there."" And then it goes several steps further."
9946	1	a	A complicated movie, erotic yet never graphic, heartfelt yet highly stylized. Chalamet delivers one of the year's best performances.
9947	9	a	Fails to gain admission into the elite group of inspired teen comedies.
9948	6	a	The movie is pleasant enough, but never quite reaches critical mass as a comedy.
9949	4	a	James takes a Segway, a cheesy mustache and the comic idea of Die Hard in a mall and bumbles his way to a lightweight but frequently funny film for the whole family.
9950	5	a	Far less interested in vehicular craziness than the wisecracking repartee of its supporting specialists.
9951	4	a	Plaza proves she can handle heading up a movie and doing something different than playing the smoky, punk alt girl fantasy
9952	3	a	Take Care of My Cat offers a refreshingly different slice of Asian cinema.
9953	3	a	A hugely satisfying tension comes from tapping the dread we push down to get through a life of constant negotiation with danger, whether it's crossing a suspension bridge or crossing the street. Who needs Freddy when routine plane travel is so fraught?
9954	1	a	Full of deadpan humor.
9955	2	a	A very satisfying meditation on a classic film.
9956	3	a	Meanders until it gets to the final third of its running time, and then it catches fire.
9957	4	a	I laughed, and frequently. There are also images I can now never forget, and kind of want to. Is this what it was like for all those people I introduced, kicking and screaming, to Aqua Teen Hunger Force?
9958	4	a	Strictly by-the-numbers supernatural horror...that doesn't solely rely on its taboo subject matter for all the shocks, boasting moments of genuine suspense.
9959	3	a	The cast is uniformly good, including Gere in the title role. But it's Foster who really glows here, giving her character a sense of depth and innocence that makes the entire unlikely premise more palatable.
9960	5	a	Quickly dissolves into contrived drama and uneven and skewed character motivations. 
9961	7	a	Timeline is offensively bad.
9962	4	a	There's so much to like here, and the film ends with a punch. For Roth's sake -- and McGregor's, for that matter -- you almost want a do-over.
9963	3	a	Powerful and heart-wrenching, gorgeous to look at, and fascinating to contemplate. All issues of religion aside, those components generally result in a film worth seeing.
9964	2	a	With Invictus, Eastwood gets his message across in much the same way as the South African special forces -- he beats us over the head with it.
9965	5	a	Twohy seems to think the eventual revelation is clever enough to be worth the price of admission by itself. It isn't. To give better value, he should have souped up the cartoonish violence of the final scenes.
9966	0	a	An emotion-charged epic of style and sophistication that is exciting and at times humorous.
9967	5	a	Lazy, dumb, and misogynistic.
9968	0	a	Capernaum will have you in floods of tears.
9969	3	a	Why do I love thee, Juliet? Let me count the ways: there are no decapitations, no car crashes, no gun fights, no pratfalls, no talking animals and no aliens - just one beautiful love story, two captivating romances and lots of picturesque Italian scenery.
9970	6	a	It's based on some DC Comics characters, which may explain the way the plot jumps around. We hear a lot about graphic novels, but this is more of a graphic anthology of strange occult ideas.
9971	3	a	A star is born in Nashville.
9972	0	a	Bolt is a winner and proof that Disney Animation is really trying to catch up to Pixar in both story quality and animation.
9973	3	a	A fun-filled foray into animated action, fantasy and adventure.
9974	6	a	...intermittently enjoyable, but like its characters too neurotic and uptight to get out of its own way.
9975	4	a	It's all very deep, but in a tricked-up, art-directed sort of way.
9976	8	a	An end-of-summer throwaway that resembles last year's Supercross in its naked ineptitude and willingness to cut corners at every turn.
9977	5	a	No saving grace here.
9978	4	a	Brooks is a distinctive writer who has a biting wit and a feel for the very human quality of ambivalence.
9979	2	a	Chadwick Boseman is charismatic as Brown - a violent, manipulative perfectionist who is emotionally disconnected from those around him.
9980	1	a	A vivid portrait of the artist and his process.
9981	3	a	A timeless tale, beautifully remastered.
9982	3	a	Well, surprisingly nuanced for a movie in which Nick Kroll plays a literal douche, anyway.
9983	3	a	It is an offbeat charmer that is fun and engaging from a storytelling standpoint, but one that also brings a surprisingly rich emotional payoff.
9984	2	a	Magical lands and sorcery add to the movie's mythic structure. While Mika is suitably simpering, the witch is delightfully evil and is a pleasure to watch. As for Reeves, his lines are minimal, but his swordplay does all the talking.
9985	1	a	The lavish coops, detailed pie machine and realistic lighting are just a small thread in a beautiful canvas of stirring images.
9986	5	a	...not fit for burying.
9987	0	a	...a fascinating study of fleeting love, proving that a lot can be done when you favor characterisation and atmosphere over traditional narrative. [Full review in Spanish]
9988	4	a	A painful experience for anyone who gets easily annoyed by the formulaic nature of Austen's writing.
9989	4	a	A unique, hyper-real whatsit that should be seen the way it was shot.
9990	0	a	Still the most wonderful movie on the subject of music ever made and the best film I've ever seen.
9991	2	a	It is not often laugh-out-loud funny, but it is consistently amusing.
9992	1	a	Maintains a wonderful balance between sentiment and satire...almost magical in its mixture of humor and poignancy.
9993	4	a	The feature debut of writer-director Nicholas Racz is twisty and clever, if not a reinvention of the genre.
9994	3	a	The movie is a dark comedy about false dreams and lost illusions -- and, thanks to a fine cast and a smart script, it's an effective one.
9995	8	a	It's enough to make you want to kill the film reels, bring them back to life and then kill them again.
9996	4	a	Great cast reveals rough and sentimental journey; Jillian Estel as Eloise is amazing
9997	2	a	Going in, I was expecting much more standard children's fare, not an existential undertaking with shout-outs to everything from Chinatown to Don Quixote. 
9998	3	a	Powerful -- and powerfully irritating. But love it or hate it, you're not likely to forget it.
9999	9	a	It's hard to convey the sheer awfulness. And that's not just me being a grumpy bloke confronted with a chick flick.
10000	1	a	Prepare your eyes for popping.
10001	6	a	All we can say is: Death be not proud. If you have to work this hard to take down these dim-witted kids, you don't deserve to be a cosmic force.
10002	9	a	It's as idiotic as a committee of bad screenwriters could make it.
10003	6	a	...the film's just not funny...
10004	3	a	Warm without sentimentality, funny without jokes, rich in character without caricature, it hits that rare spot where we receive intense pleasure at the recognition of truth.
10005	3	a	Here's something you don't see every day: a high-school comedy for old poops.
10006	6	a	Offers the most lush, picturesque underwater photography in recent cinematic memory. For a while, that's actually enough, until its aimless wandering gets the best of it.
10007	2	a	Modestly entertaining.
10008	4	a	Dealing with adoption from differnet perspectives, Gracia's film is timely, well acted tale that unfortunately gets too conventional and schematic as it goes along, explaining each and every detail; even so, Naomi Watts and Annette Bening are splendid.
10009	6	a	It's easy enough to accept the romantic-comedy luck of the two finding each another. It's much tougher, and ultimately useless, to buy everything else about this fairy tale of self-reinvention in a stalled economy.
10010	3	a	With consistently drop-dead gorgeous cinematography, Into the Wild tells a touching and ultimately harrowing tale of personal growth.
10011	1	a	Paul Thomas Anderson's Inherent Vice is a postcard of the sun going down on California. On second viewing, it was a majestic drift that took me out to sea.
10012	9	a	It's true, writer/director Malcolm D. Lee does pound home a few life lessons, but it mostly comes at the expense of animal attacks, farts, and all-around comedic laziness.
10013	1	a	After just a few years in the spotlight, Eminem has accomplished something Elvis, Madonna, Michael and Mariah have not: He's made a great movie.
10014	4	a	Cute, silly family fare from Nickelodeon.
10015	5	a	Palo Alto is as fuzzy, scattered and aimless as its protagonists' lives.
10016	0	a	Great turn by Walter Matthau in aged makeup, and nicely directed by friend Jack Lemmon.
10017	1	a	[Apatow] makes these basic situations as humane and as funny as you'd expect, and he makes it look effortless.
10018	3	a	Still worth seeing, as always, because of that amazing Sturges dialogue.
10019	4	a	Beautiful to look at, but deficient in the plot department.
10020	4	a	It's an intriguing moral dilemma, even while stretching the boundaries of credibility.
10021	4	a	An ambitious if errant undertaking.
10022	0	a	A movie experience that carries a lingering, powerful aftershock.
10023	4	a	Logan Lucky follows the classic structure of the Heist Movies... [Full review in Spanish]
10024	6	a	Cuba Gooding Jr. falls victim to the Nell syndrome, in which a vibrant, loquacious actor decides that the road to an Oscar nomination is to wear a slack expression and a set of Nutty Professor teeth.
10025	2	a	Monster may be an appropriate memorial to Wuornos, though it can't possibly be as sad and miserable as her poor life must have been. 
10026	3	a	Belly laughs are few and far between but the overarching tone of silliness deftly underscored by the human experience makes for a largely fulfilling cinematic experience. 
10027	4	a	It entertained me for 'what it was.'
10028	7	a	The talented cast is largely wasted.
10029	10	a	The Wayans family's latest dim-witted fart comedy is even worse than its last one
10030	1	a	With an intimacy caught in tight close-ups, Abbott and Nixon hold the pared-down script and each other gently. Like grief itself, this film might knock the wind right out of you.
10031	3	a	Despite the ridiculous premise, Jurassic Park does an incredible job of showing us what dinosaurs might have looked and acted like.
10032	1	a	Very much an Almodovar picture with most of the anticipated outrageous occurrences intact.
10033	4	a	The cast ... does what it can to keep things lively.
10034	6	a	Features some intense action, but ultimately succumbs to the pitfalls of disaster films before it.
10035	5	a	Like a summer fling, forgotten as soon as you re-enter the real world.
10036	3	a	Is it as bold as it might be? Does it blaze with invention? Is it the best babbling-bee urban biopic, bar none? Just about.
10037	4	a	It's hard not to like a film that has sky divers jumping out of helicopters to catch flying dragons in a big net.
10038	6	a	This isn't a black comedy -- it's more like a whiter shade of pale.
10039	0	a	Is it too early to call this Schrader's masterpiece?
10040	5	a	Everything feels stilted and strangely flat.
10041	6	a	Rafelson is so true to his sour vision of crime, deception and a rottenness at the core of our natures -- he's as cheerful as a Jim Thompson potboiler -- that we never get a chance to like or care about his characters.
10042	6	a	Another astonishing true story gets the Hollywood treatment and ends up being rather flattened in the process
10043	8	a	There's only one winner in this film, and it's Applebee's. Take my word for it and watch some Travel Channel instead.
10044	4	a	The House with a Clock in Its Walls is a magical, kid-friendly horror flick with exceptionally fun performances by Jack Black and Cate Blanchett.
10045	0	a	Despite the cuteness, there's little in the way of icky sentiment - indeed the spectre of death hangs over the story - but it's a captivating world you won't want to come home from.
10046	0	a	This film is a delight.
10047	7	a	I, Frankenstein leaves itself open to be franchised, but the chances of that happening are equal to Eckhart putting this film at the top of his resume.
10048	4	a	chilling and inventive
10049	3	a	While this is a familiar theme that viewers have watched countless times, the way Zhao has scripted and directed The Rider makes it something new.
10050	3	a	In a manner that is leisurely in pace, ruminative in nature and quiet in tone ... Coppola gives her lonely travellers all the space they need to make this tentative and ultimately magical connection.
10051	0	a	By far the best of the CGI-animated films in the Disney canon, a wondrous and exciting spectacle that is just as enticing narratively as it is visually.
10052	9	a	Unless you're of the temperament that derives boundless pleasure from the serial assault on the genitals of large people by a cut-and-paste little person, Little Man will likely prove about as bearable as diaper rash.
10053	3	a	Verhoeven's version of Philip Dick's story is vigorous, exciting, and inventive sci-fi thriller, combining pulp savviness, ultra-graphic violence, and Oscar-winning special effects.
10054	4	a	When Ted first came out, it surprised audiences by being touching as well as funny; the sequel one ups it by being funny and touching and boasting some big ideas. 
10055	4	a	Really, Nebraska is a small-scale quixotic adventure about the importance of dreams, no matter how pie-eyed, in which the outlined flaws could all be forgiven, if it just went somewhere a bit more surprising. 
10056	3	a	It may not be on a par with Brokeback, nor as powerful as Lust, Caution, but Taking Woodstock is another triumph for Ang Lee, a director whose resume gets more and more diverse with every project he tackles.
10057	4	a	Sadly, the movie is a zoo.
10058	3	a	This inspired nutball comedy is like its heroes on their mission: It just gets progressively more nuts, more blotto.
10059	2	a	Hoffman and Streisand...are a wonderful addition to the comedic mix with their relaxed, laid back lifestyle and penchant for randy sex
10060	4	a	those expecting a March of the Penguins-like good time are going to hit eject on the DVD player feeling awfully depressed
10061	4	a	...pure southern sexploitation cut with equal measures of humor and heart. Christina Ricci just about eats the screen alive.
10062	0	a	Rio Bravo may not be a perfect film, but it's close enough as to not matter.
10063	3	a	'This'll be over by tomorrow,' the big dog says to his prey at one point. Alpha Dog is full of good actors, young and old, making the most of such deceptively simple lines.
10064	3	a	What is immediately striking about this movie is the immaculate camerawork, framing and detailing.
10065	9	a	A trip to the innermost circle of comedy hell.
10066	0	a	The best of Craig's adventures; a superbly mounted, clear-headed adventure with enough delicious oddity and exhilaration to help forget there ever was a Quantum of Solace.
10067	9	a	Basic elements of production that audiences take for granted-fripperies such as coherent editing or logical character behavior-go horribly awry here and make other films look better by comparison. 
10068	3	a	David Lean's restrained direction, Katharine Hepburn's nuanced turn as a spinsterish middle-aged secretary, and above all Venice's alluring sights compensate considerably for a plot that's borderline banal and schmaltzy.
10069	4	a	Throwing in several snarly baddies and lots of speeding boats and planes and cars -- plus, a cool climactic shootout -- Mann's the man for creating foreboding environments and intense action sequences.
10070	0	a	A film of rare beauty and pain
10071	5	a	I couldn't wait for this movie to end.
10072	3	a	Light, fluffy, and enjoyable.
10073	4	a	"... there's no final ""Final"" in sight, good news indeed for New Line and Warner."
10074	3	a	A stirring, affecting story about courage, trust and the inevitability of bizarre allegiances during times of desperation.
10075	5	a	"The satirical sharpness that defines the duo's at-times incandescently brilliant ""South Park"" has been shunted aside in favour of vomit gags and screaming homophobia."
10076	3	a	A depraved, perfect storm of cinema.
10077	1	a	It's hard to imagine how it could be any more Almodovar-esque than it is.
10078	0	a	Simon's fears, feelings, relationships and traumas are all real and feel true, and are portrayed in an entertaining, infectious and charming way.
10079	7	a	When I was young, I was taught to ignore people I didn't know or recognize. That's what I'd advise doing with this brainless film.
10080	3	a	Since the characters have aged into middle-aged men now, the film has a very different kind of energy to it, mixing the visceral imagery with a knowing sense of nostalgia. And once again, it has a lot to say about the state of the world.
10081	1	a	Hoffman and Linney make a great comedy team, even though the movie they're in is a sometimes grim affair...
10082	3	a	A meticulously-told true story that gives you a portrait of the complexities, big and small, that make undercover operations risky. 
10083	4	a	Ultimately I found the film to be fairly compelling, mainly because of Kilmer's performance, but it does suffer a bit from the lack of focus that this style of storytelling often falls victim to.
10084	4	a	Light, breezy romcom will make you want to go to France. 
10085	6	a	It's like a box of chocolates, but with hollow centers.
10086	5	a	Traumatic early-life experiences can only go so far, can only prove so much. Lots of people have horrible childhoods and still manage not to become flesh-eating serial killers.
10087	6	a	Morgan Freeman gives a strong portrait of S. African pres. Mandela in a Clint Eastwood directed historical sports flick that doesn't live up to the true story that inspired it.
10088	2	a	Columbus overcomes several of the first film's problems with this much darker, slightly more edgy sequel.
10089	6	a	The level of exaggerated violence and gore is so gross and disgusting that the film takes on a horror-movie look, which tends to undermine its intentions as a thoughtful exploration of troubled times for blacks.
10090	4	a	A somewhat generic romantic comedy blessed with a generous heart, bright dialogue and irresistible stars. Plus, it's not averse to taking risks.
10091	1	a	Nothing happens and everything happens, the story's growing emotional power coming from subtle, complicated lead performances, exquisite pacing and dreamy, melancholy music from Sufjan Stevens.
10092	3	a	On the evidence of A Most Wanted Man, one of [Hoffman's] final films, our loss is all the greater as he's simply magnificent in a gripping espionage thriller.
10093	7	a	Waist Deep turns out to be a shallow waste.
10094	3	a	Tradition, love and intimacy are intertwined in the beautiful Japanese film Love and Honor... [Full review in Spanish]
10095	2	a	"It may be a true ""chick flick,"" but as far as those movies go, you could do a hell of a lot worse."
10096	6	a	One big marriage counseling session set within the walls of the making of Psycho
10097	7	a	the appeal of the movie so disintegrates with every second of resolution that I found myself hating it by the ending credits
10098	0	a	Chicken Run is the rare, true original in modern movies. It will delight you beyond words. Don't even think about missing it.
10099	3	a	Clever spoof with great roles for Fonda and Marvin
10100	6	a	It's not the best King adaptation ever, but it's a good one. See it for Johnny.
10101	6	a	Valkyrie has all the dramatic oomph of a History Channel re-enactment.
10102	3	a	It's Penn's biggest-hearted film, a hippie epic that buoys even as it wends toward catastrophe.
10103	2	a	Zwellinger is cantaloupe sweet and as lovable as always, but it's Greg Kinear that snatches this wobbling film up by its bridges.
10104	8	a	Any working mother is bound to see herself in this. Provided she is also a fictional character on a sitcom, that is.
10105	4	a	The result is more interesting as an intellectual experience than as entertainment; you watch Cosmopolis fully aware that it wants to be deconstructed rather than enjoyed.
10106	3	a	"Its avalanche of idiosyncrasies might make it tough sledding for general audiences, but for trippy, glassblown noir, ""Inherent Vice"" is a prime cut."
10107	6	a	During the end credits, kids pop up onscreen to warn you that every time you turn on your lights, a baby polar bear falls to his death through a crevasse of ice cracked by global warming. Or something to that effect.
10108	3	a	Kate Hudson is irresistably adorable in this frothy comedy about the head-on-collision between two competing bets and one overpowering attraction.
10109	5	a	It put-puts along like a moped in busy traffic, content to amble around but not go anywhere.
10110	2	a	Smith has more comic charisma with James than Mendes, not that there's anything wrong with that.
10111	5	a	Simplistic, standard two hours of non-intellectually stimulating amusement.
10112	5	a	Standard coming of age story, the adult gimmick doesn't add anything.
10113	1	a	It's at its best when young Barton Fink simply stares at a picture of a bathing beauty contemplating the ocean -- a Hollywood dream.
10114	5	a	Substandard Will Smith action-hero vehicle.
10115	1	a	Christopher Nolan's directing skills are in evidence with The Prestige, which follows the long feud of Victorian-era illusionists.
10116	1	a	Brace yourself for something more sophisticated and ... adult. The Incredibles is not cut from the same touchy-feely ... mold as Toy Story, Monsters Inc. or Finding Nemo. 
10117	9	a	This pic is pretty Focking lame.
10118	4	a	Less of a philosophical argument and more of a character piece driven deep into the heart by Duplass and Plaza.
10119	6	a	The film is noteworthy for its tiny if incomplete effort to pour old wine in a new bottle.
10120	3	a	"The Bourne Identity"" creates its own new coherence of indie arthouse and commercial thriller. "
10121	3	a	Brewer's hard-bitten drama isn't merely defiant; it spits fire at America's phony media-fed version of itself.
10122	0	a	Be prepared for long intervals of holding your breath, because this is the real deal.
10123	9	a	...the film is without any redeeming social value. It's bad history, bad filmmaking, and bad pornography, too.
10124	0	a	Campion takes her time to tell her tender story, but the film rewards with a conclusion I found incredibly moving. This is certainly one of the best films of the year.
10125	6	a	Either this is a tragic family or a satirical one, and the film seems uncertain which way to jump.
10126	9	a	"Among the wisest things ever said about old age will always be the immortal dictum of Bette Davis: ""Old age ain't for sissies."" It also ain't for people whose skills have vanished completely but are pretending they haven't."
10127	9	a	A thrill-less video game adaptation.
10128	0	a	"The Rider"" reinvigorates tropes from the western genre of men, horses, honor codes and vast expanses of nature with a refreshing lack of sentimentality, without sacrificing their inherent lyricism and poetry."
10129	5	a	When the characters dance, they don't speak, and when they don't speak, Step Up has the potential to be diverting entertainment.
10130	6	a	While it may have some scares for its intended young audience, it largely falls flat for everybody else.
10131	3	a	Glossy escapist entertainment that's fun to watch but says nothing terribly noteworthy about the human condition.
10132	5	a	My big complaint: Take Indiana Jones out of the story, and nothing changes. The Nazis still find the Ark, still open it, still die.
10133	2	a	Director Greg Berlanti does a great job of balancing the tone of the film with a coming-of-age film. This film is funny, heartbreaking, enduring and a really does move along at a great pace.
10134	3	a	The Wizard of Oz meets What Dreams May Come by way of, oh I dunno, something post-apocalyptic, snarky, and fun.
10135	6	a	Predictable, nonsensical plot, laughably lame dialogue and a surfeit of cloying environmentalist piety.
10136	4	a	...tough and grim but still spry ... feels like something of a rearguard action in the case of the British Empire.
10137	3	a	Bleak, wintry and rigorously controlled.
10138	1	a	As sordid and vile as possible.
10139	3	a	However familiar it may ring, this very downbeat tale about dreams dashed in the name of stifling social conformity feels freshly devastating, thanks to the lead pair.
10140	1	a	Serenity is a brash, funny, action-packed bit of sci-fi ecstasy.
10141	9	a	Both a dismal farewell to the old crew and a dull introduction to the new.
10142	5	a	The main problem with the film is that it seems to be missing a sequence where we see Kat and Nick actually falling for each other - the script pretty much expects us to take it for granted just because they're the leads.
10143	4	a	Its originality lies in the fact that it depicts white middle-class kids on the loose, calling their women bitches and listening endlessly to violent, misogynist and homophobic black rap.
10144	1	a	Legendary director Robert Altman gives us a crime movie that somehow makes an old story seem fresh and funny.
10145	6	a	Loosely speaking, we're in All of Me territory again, and, strictly speaking, Schneider is no Steve Martin.
10146	5	a	Spielberg gives in to his worst tendencies, and turns Peter Pan into a day-glo mess.
10147	3	a	The characters, even ones that barely more than cameos, are well rounded and fully drawn.
10148	6	a	A lot of the actor's usual mercurial charm isn't used to full effect and is actually tempered when it doesn't feel like it should be.
10149	2	a	David Fincher's first-rate direction effortlessly wipes the floor with the soporific Swedish counterpart. In the end, though, even Fincher can't froth up some of the novel's more procedural killer-of-the-week fancies.
10150	3	a	An extended inquiry that, through de Emilio's editing strategies, emerges as both claustrophobic and cleansing. 
10151	4	a	It's a movie without that emotional spark that lets us connect with her, or anybody else.
10152	3	a	What the film revival of Miami Vice lacks in substance it makes up for in adrenaline.
10153	7	a	Trying to glean life lessons from this movie is about as futile as hunting for an emotionally honest bone in its bloated body.
10154	3	a	A remarkably faithful adaptation with a classy straight man and a dark side. Plus jokes galore -- whoever felt it was appropriate to use Rizzo as a pair of bellows to get the fire going deserves an extra helping of plum pudding.
10155	3	a	Brazen, hilarious, disgusting, audacious, altogether fresh.
10156	9	a	Yes, it's dreck, but we've all seen duff movies. What makes this so painfully exasperating is that 'The Tourist' is so bloody pleased with itself.
10157	4	a	The Cloverfield Paradox is a worthy addition to the franchise and does a lot to connect the films, but it is also the weakest of the three films.
10158	1	a	An unquestionable work of conviction that should outlast the controversy and trigger constructive dialogue for years to come.
10159	4	a	Problem is it hammers home its point about racism being alive and well in America until it becomes annoyingly repetitive and preachy.
10160	7	a	How does Kat feel about falling in love with a high-priced escort? What prompts Nick's lightning-bolt conversion to unpaid monogamy? What kind of work can a former comp lit major expect to find in the world? These and other questions are left unanswered.
10161	3	a	The sheer scale of the movie should have broad ranged appeal among arthouse audiences, and maybe beyond.
10162	5	a	Had it been available to him, Max Bialystock would have opted for this as his guaranteed flop rather than Springtime for Hitler.
10163	4	a	It reminds me of those Cary Grant screwball comedies.
10164	6	a	My tepidly positive reaction to Hereafter comes as a pretty big surprise, given my feelings about Eastwood's recent work.
10165	3	a	"OK, kids, who's ready for an animated version of ""Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas""?"
10166	8	a	The film is a disaster from start to finish.
10167	0	a	Pi is a lesson to aspiring film makers everywhere: perfect your skills, be original, be bold. It's a pity young British directors aren't making films as unique and imaginative as this. Startlingly good cinema.
10168	0	a	A clever and fun cinematic postcard that can transport susceptible romantics to the City of Light. 
10169	4	a	A profoundly flawed feature, but it retains an irresistible subject, with Brown's insanity and adversity making an energetic leap to the big screen. 
10170	4	a	An emotional shell game that leaves you feeling cheated even though, on the surface at least, everyone is a winner.
10171	1	a	One of my favorite movies of the year, thus far.
10172	4	a	A suspenseful, stylishly slick espionage thriller - a new twist on a familiar story, distinguished by authentic performances by Bryan Cranston and John Leguizamo.
10173	6	a	... the courageous true story behind The Infiltrator deserves much more than the coat of beige paint it's smothered in.
10174	4	a	The picture annoys you, but it also wrings happy tears, because Crowe pulls at your heartstrings in crafty ways.
10175	6	a	It's about as close to real comedy as a cup of milky tea is to a real meal.
10176	0	a	An absorbing, deeply affecting, well-acted -- and remarkably evenhanded -- antiwar statement.
10177	3	a	A Private War goes further in all senses of the term.
10178	1	a	Sausage Party is obviously the product of diseased minds, and I love it.
10179	4	a	A hilarious comedy about the ridiculous lenghts a young man goes to in order to prove himself to his girlfriend's family.
10180	3	a	Clarke's terrific performance...embodies several aspects of the character, sometimes all at once.
10181	6	a	The rise of online porn is simply the hook for a thoroughly rote mixed-up-with-the-mob drama that overdoes all the obvious cliches
10182	3	a	"The Skin I Live In"" is like a David Cronenberg horror film as made by a director who doesn't fear the body but revels in it, who is too sensual and amoral by nature to find anything truly disgusting or foreign."
10183	2	a	It is at times capable of achieving the same Brooksian magic of Broadcast News or As Good As It Gets, and at others feels like Brooks is lamely impersonating his previous work
10184	5	a	Ewan McGregor's directorial debut doesn't do justice to Philip Roth's great book.
10185	2	a	When's the last time the tightly clenched buttcheeks of a former pro football star tickled your funnybone?
10186	0	a	An enormously entertaining pop-culture ride.
10187	7	a	There have been photo spreads in Entertainment Weekly of old TV casts brought back together that have provided as much satisfaction, for a whole lot less money.
10188	2	a	Should please those who can live with the droll acting.
10189	1	a	A script seemingly built from pieces of other scary movies ... comes off as fresh and original.
10190	0	a	The filmmaker and his cast masterfully capture... the unspoken thoughts and feelings that complicate our understanding of why they carry themselves the way that they do.
10191	3	a	It's as if Brown's life was one long groove, and he always stayed deep in the pocket no matter where he was.
10192	6	a	Von Donnersmarck, who brilliantly depicted government surveillance in East Berlin before the fall of the wall in his earlier German film, astonishingly can't even find a way to make Interpol's spying interesting here.
10193	5	a	It's good-looking but unsubstantial.
10194	6	a	Opens with one hell of a set piece but it's all downhill from there.
10195	9	a	There are a lot of people local and abroad responsible for this dismal film.
10196	3	a	Astro Boy is better than most of its recent competitors, such as Monsters vs. Aliens and Kung Fu Panda.
10197	6	a	You'd expect Gondry's version of a superhero movie to be either brilliantly creative or spectacularly misguided, and it's neither; just sporadically funny but more often plodding.
10198	0	a	A smart, intelligent, and sumptuous entertainment, and for a change a Hollywood movie that captures the essence of genius and creativity, in this case Mozart's music and Salieri's sponsorship, without resorting to visual or verbal cliches.
10199	5	a	Has to be the sorriest excuse for a reprise since Highlander -- The Final Dimension.
10200	4	a	The To Do List settles for surface and cartoony rather than deep and heartfelt.
10201	3	a	Talk to Me offers uplift without phoniness, history without undue didacticism and a fair number of funny, dirty jokes.
10202	2	a	'Silver Linings Playbook' is fun, sharp and sometimes moving, but it's not reinventing any kind of wheel.
10203	1	a	So many stories come packaged in hyped genres that we can forget how much character can hold sway. Watts, Bening and Washington -- along with a fine ensemble and a humane director -- make sure we remember.
10204	4	a	You don't even have to be a Celtics fan to appreciate it. In fact, considering who becomes the butt of the film's ultimate joke, perhaps it's best if you're not one.
10205	4	a	Like an elaborately woven cobweb, it's a marvel but so full of holes that it's all too easily swept from memory.
10206	5	a	If Liman's ambition is to leave IFC to make big Hollywood entertainment vehicles, then I would suggest he rent the entire Tony Scott library.
10207	3	a	Like disasters in real life, the film hits you in the gut with a vision of catastrophe, and leaves you to sort out what it all means.
10208	5	a	It stages its jokes externally, such as smashing bikes, spilling on skateboards, and catching on fire -- all the better if accompanied by a hot soundtrack hit.
10209	4	a	... an acceptable time-killer ... 
10210	1	a	Josh Mond's movie is an unwavering gaze into an abyss, provided by absolutely stirring performances from his lead performers.
10211	3	a	Suitably stylish remake from director David Fincher, which succeeds thanks to a strong script, striking photography and superb performances from Craig and Mara.
10212	3	a	Say what you want about Eminem, but the guy has passion and a gift with words - the finale at the battle simply rocks the house.
10213	1	a	It is a sunny, delightful, dreamy comedy, filled with lovely performances, skillful direction and topped off with an understated, clever, extraordinary script.
10214	6	a	Filmmakers who want to out-Tarantino writer-director Quentin Tarantino had best back off. 
10215	2	a	A conventional, but well-crafted film about a historic legal battle in Ireland over a man's right to raise his own children.
10216	2	a	The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo is everything you would expect from Fincher's version of the book and that is the good and the bad. Slick and entertaining throughout, there is absolutely nothing in it which surprises.
10217	3	a	The movie is aware of its own riches; it fills up your plate and dares you not to eat.
10218	6	a	The movie is a sermon about the evils of bachelorhood, and it's probably best that men keep their girlfriends from seeing it. Things could get ugly.
10219	9	a	Okay, Rowan Atkinson is a funny guy. So what the hell happened with this?
10220	2	a	Hereafter features excellent acting and characterizations and deftly avoids being the kind of bore movies about this subject tend to be but doesn't register on a strong enough level to be considered in the upper echelons of the careers of anyone involved.
10221	3	a	The movie is written, acted and directed as a story, not as an exercise in mindless kinetic energy.
10222	2	a	It demands you to keep thinking about it after its through with you.
10223	3	a	Every kid out there can determine whether or not they need this film, but each of them absolutely deserves a confection this sweet, thoughtful, and sincere.
10224	3	a	Fast, thrilling and everything that James Bond no longer is.
10225	6	a	A discussion is better than none, but the conversation can be improved.
10226	3	a	A priceless gem of a comedy drama...
10227	9	a	In which the fight for black rights, instead of having a fiery and inspiring crackle, is like being hit over the head with a long, soggy sermonette.
10228	4	a	Well-cast, sporadically engaging but easily forgettable.
10229	1	a	A superlative, juicy mother-daughter melodrama with top notch performance from Bette Davis, at the top of her form, and the rest of the cast.
10230	3	a	Deserves recognition for its light, often hilarious depiction of summertime boyhood and the impatience to become an adult.
10231	3	a	The Glenn Miller Orchestra is THE reason to catch this WWII musical.
10232	3	a	Even though these heroes are simplistic... Spielberg makes sure their motives and goals are transparent, the force driving us breathlessly to the movie's climax. 
10233	1	a	[It's] optimistic. Hokey, even. But it's beautiful, too.
10234	7	a	Roth apparently wanted to make this film to entice children into the horror genre, so this is much more light-hearted than scary. In fact, it's not scary. Problem is that it is not funny, either.
10235	6	a	it is hard to resist the suspicion that the whole thing is a ruse to satisfy some deep-seated sadistic urge in von Trier's artistic psyche
10236	8	a	It's always a bad sign in a thriller when the big reveal is greeted by hoots of derisive laughter.
10237	3	a	I have a good many reservations about the film's ideas, but they are greatly outweighed by my admiration for a technical virtuosity that by fair means and foul achieves exceptional emotional intensity at the same time.
10238	3	a	Unnecessarily lengthy and repetitious, but still has a certain charm that can offer entertainment for both children and adults.
10239	10	a	This is a film that can only be watched in utter misery. See it, and share in cinema's degradation.
10240	1	a	By the end of this haunting, hypnotic film, you feel you have watched lives being lived, not just imagined.
10241	3	a	Uncannily in tune with contemporary global events.
10242	6	a	"Albert Nobbs"" is clearly Close's show - for better and for worse."
10243	5	a	If Wedding Crashers is in your top ten rom-coms ever, you might not hate this. Otherwise, it's too gross to be sweet and too sweet to be gross.
10244	4	a	It will be way too much for some, but does have a heart, ends on a nice note and you certainly won't forget the totally un-embarrassable Haddish in a hurry.
10245	2	a	The character is written as the most unlikable person one could ever meet. Despite this fact, Jack manages to make the character sympathetic.
10246	7	a	Good news: you've got great actors with wonderful chemistry and comic timing. Bad News: they're playing some of the most irritating, unlikable, infuriating characters ever committed to film
10247	3	a	A lot of vigorous actors doing vigorous work in the service of a crafty, fast-moving, well-told story.
10248	6	a	Tone deafness abides.
10249	5	a	Bowers's play-it-straight attitude towards the material combined with the crisp, if unspectacular, animation doesn't allow 'Astro Boy' a moment to bob its head above the ever-swelling digimation pack.
10250	9	a	...a terminally misbegotten endeavor...
10251	5	a	What damages this obsolete Alfie more is the film's limited message, which primarily speaks to a dwindling community of urban lotharios and insomniacs perusing singles bars
10252	6	a	This country music drama boasts solid performances and a few catchy songs, but its ending might have you singing the blues.
10253	4	a	"The misunderstandings are all thankfully low on the ""Three's Company"" scale while Hartnett and Sossamon's chemistry is undeniably potent."
10254	4	a	Often gripping, and elevated by Cranston's superb central performance. But it's hard not to feel like we've seen this before, often and done better.
10255	0	a	Just when Woody Allen seemed to have written and directed himself out, he comes up with his biggest hit.
10256	5	a	Wow, I haven't seen this much over-the-hill action since Don Ameche and Hume Cronyn did laps in Cocoon.
10257	2	a	...a well acted, highly stylized, and very entertaining romp that unfolds on the screen with natural aplomb, elicits laughs, perhaps a few tears, but will ultimately fade from memory once you exit the theater.
10258	3	a	This is some pretty raw stuff to gift-wrap under the Christmas tree this holiday movie season. But it is also a great story for awards season, when adults can finally see movies for adults.
10259	4	a	It's fine, and it's an improvement over the Alien vs. Predator spinoffs, but we can do better than this.
10260	2	a	Chappaquiddick is no hatchet job. Instead, it offers a serious meditation on the uses and abuses of power, a story that is timely in any era
10261	9	a	To quote Clint Eastwood's Monco in For A Few Dollars More, you people need a new sheriff.
10262	4	a	That last part makes for quite a good, crackling suspense thriller, meticulously researched in all details by the perfectionist Singer.
10263	9	a	Turns out, it's ruinously hard to raise a smile at IEDs and arms deals gone awry, especially in a conflict that's still raging. No doubt it's meant to be satire, but it feels like profiteering.
10264	10	a	So desperately unfunny that you wish someone would sue for false advertising.
10265	5	a	With only some scattershot scenes of physical humor, 'Paul Blart: Mall Cop' does little to keep viewers safe from boredom.
10266	6	a	What the film doesn't have is a sense of humor.
10267	5	a	Has no narrative thrust and nothing profound to say, although it's mostly well acted and features some diverting locations, including a good deal of south London.
10268	6	a	If you've seen one rusticle-encrusted antique armoire, you've seen 'em all.
10269	2	a	Meet the Thermians: the biggest science-fiction nerds of all time.
10270	1	a	It's a rough haul at times, but expertly executed and entirely worthy of the anticipation leading up to its release.
10271	0	a	One of the finest primal scare-thrillers ever to come out of Hollywood.
10272	4	a	The Soloist is great in the visual, sound and acting department but fails to tell a story that grabs your attention.
10273	9	a	If you really feel the need to be bullied and insulted, just call up your HMO provider or reserve a table at an expensive restaurant.
10274	1	a	Coppola is a master of moments and details, and here they add up to a story that is beautifully bittersweet.
10275	5	a	Just think that you could have sacrificed ten quarters to play Resident Evil the video game instead of coughing up ten bucks to witness the monotonous Resident Evil the movie.
10276	6	a	Prepare for whiplash as Man of the Year veers in an instant from astute comedy to complete disaster.
10277	4	a	Unjustly dismissed and really quite watchable, despite Brad Pitt's silly Irish accent.
10278	5	a	A space opera / horror / thriller mash-up that clutches ineffectually at philosophical and socio-political profundity while pastiching familiar sci-fi tropes ...
10279	3	a	It would be abhorrent if it weren't so screamingly funny.
10280	1	a	A poetic meditation on mortality and honor that delivers the action and suspense of any good gangster film.
10281	6	a	Secret Window had me for the first two-thirds of the film but it falls apart into typical [Stephen] King-isms in the last third...
10282	4	a	Features terrific performances, stunning action sequences and some state-of-the-art special effects, but it's also far too long ...
10283	6	a	even with Smith's considerable charm and his proven track record as Independence Day weekend movie god, Hancock doesn't succeed as a truly satisfying holiday-movie blockbuster.
10284	3	a	The vision of life after death varies between the religious and the non-religious, the optimists and the pessimists and the believers and non-believers. There are few after-life stories, though, as unique and humorous as this.
10285	4	a	Harris ... brings decency and conviction to the part of a man forced to answer to football fans who worry he's spending too much time calling on Radio and not enough time calling plays.
10286	6	a	a slightly more accurate mythology of the Cuban Missile Crisis 
10287	0	a	It's marvelous work all around, especially by Foxx and Downey. Their duet makes The Soloist sing.
10288	3	a	Absorbing and satisfying, just like a good old-fashioned page-turner of a novel.
10289	3	a	This is a very well done, creepy film that will scare audiences for years to come.
10290	5	a	All formula, all the time.
10291	6	a	The To Do List feels tailor-made for Aubrey Plaza's deadpan delivery, but never quite manages to hit its stride despite an impressive supporting cast and an inspired central concept.
10292	9	a	What can you say about a film where John Malkovich can't work up any enthusiasm for playing a villain?
10293	4	a	Besides Cranston, co-stars Benjamin Bratt, Diane Kruger, Amy Ryan and a particularly terrific John Leguizamo juice the film to life, if only for a few minutes at a time.
10294	5	a	It's a blessing that The Wedding Date doesn't try too hard, but it's a curse that it doesn't try hard enough.
10295	3	a	Midnight in Paris is charming and clever, at times wickedly astute and hopeful.
10296	1	a	Depp isn't as annoying in this as he has been elsewhere.
10297	2	a	Better than the average Bond, but not the greatest.
10298	3	a	The ruefully funny Jack Goes Boating, which, refreshingly, takes a generous view of its flawed characters, is a must for us many Hoffman fans.
10299	3	a	If you're looking for the Don Johnson version of Sonny Crockett, you're better off looking at television re-runs.
10300	0	a	Paul Schrader has made his masterpiece.
10301	4	a	With belief soundly suspended and your senses of sight and sound reeling under full frontal assault, this hybrid of action, chase movie sets the bar low - and clears it with ease.
10302	9	a	Lacking originality or true wit, this mildly amusing but utterly banal comedy again demonstrates that Joe Roth is not much of a director and that Billy Crystal can do only one thing as an actor--be Billy Crystal.
10303	5	a	There is something soothing in how formulaic this film is.
10304	6	a	Redgrave is incandescent, and casting Franco Nero as Lorenzo was inspired.
10305	0	a	A masterfully melancholy work with an Oscar worthy screenplay.
10306	1	a	When the movie is over, and we know all that is to be known, it deserves some thought.
10307	1	a	If you don't leave the cinema with a smile on your face, I'll be very, very surprised. 
10308	3	a	"It's tough not to describe without using the word ""powerful."" For pure cinematic artistry it's a masterpiece showing man's inhumanity to man, or in this case, the Son of Man"
10309	0	a	Ava DuVernay's vital civil rights drama is the film Martin Luther King deserved.
10310	4	a	While I thought The Light Between Oceans could have been a better movie, I'm glad that I saw it for two reasons . . . Alicia Vikander and Rachel Weisz. There's nothing wrong with a chick flick, when the chicks shine that bright.
10311	3	a	"This is another in a list of fine performances by Miles Teller, who was so good in last year's ""Whiplash."" Here he captures the ego of Pazienza perfectly, making a man whose boasting should make him unlikable actually become someone to care about."
10312	5	a	Red and Battle: Convoluted story, motion capture sucks warmth out of every scene
10313	4	a	A deep, complex look at the almost insurmountable task of finding happiness from complete discontent
10314	9	a	[A] honking heap of humourless hokum.
10315	2	a	The premise of this British comedy, out-of-work male strippers, is contrived and calculated, but the film exudes charm and optimism. 
10316	2	a	The two actors are soldiers of hard-headed substance at attention in a field of milder actors at ease.
10317	3	a	Even at almost a full two hours in length, the movie feels as trim as its star.
10318	9	a	...incompetent filmmaking with nonsensical narrative jump cuts, silly dialogue and characters who sway from one extreme to the other with no central balancing emotional core.
10319	9	a	Akin to exhuming a once good-looking corpse; wholly unnecessary - and a bit of a mess.
10320	4	a	Surprisingly watchable despite the formulaic teen format.
10321	3	a	Jarmusch's lyrical update on the western genre is a real joy.
10322	6	a	Soft-core cornography.
10323	1	a	Subtle and understated, a meditation on morality, mortality and murder that escalates into a small emotional powerhouse.
10324	3	a	it would be difficult to come away from Tupac: Resurrection without some level of admiration for this complex artist. 
10325	6	a	Mazer's previous onscreen experience is undeniably obvious. No penis is left unfilmed, no crude scene prevented from going on far too long.
10326	3	a	... a smart, subtle, stripped-down gem, a low-fi version of what we're used to seeing Payne do.
10327	2	a	Spielberg directs his early scenes with a vigorous and absolute sense of terror. 
10328	6	a	As one random and chaotic supernatural brawl follows another, the decision to keep the lead villain on the sidelines becomes increasingly puzzling. Why make a movie about a witch hunter without a memorable evil witch?
10329	4	a	The film is far from perfect. Sometimes it's silly. But, the action and the atmosphere make this a world worth exploring. Paul Chambers, CNN.
10330	4	a	Sehr accurately captures new love -- at its mildest distracting, at its harshest destructive.
10331	7	a	lacks a sense of fun
10332	3	a	It is a bravura display of acting from Mr. Cage, and equally dazzling work from director Brian De Palma.
10333	1	a	A mesmerizing, understated tragedy. 
10334	6	a	Unlike the book, there's no big emotional breakdown; instead, this is a postcard-pretty case of midlife soul-searching.
10335	9	a	Like a cocky teenager who's had a couple of drinks before the party, [Parker and Stone] don't have a plan for who they want to offend, only an intention to be as offensive as possible.
10336	5	a	This is the first picture in the series that feels inert.
10337	5	a	It needs something quite special to save this film from toxic splurges of sentiment. Lisa Kudrow and Kevin Dillon duly oblige as a pair of fabulously awful foster parents.
10338	4	a	Consistently more fun than it has any right to be, Meet the Parents is an example of how sometimes it really is all about casting the right couple of stars.
10339	5	a	Chappaquiddick succeeds in showing the dark side of the political machinery behind the Kennedys, but there has to be a way to do that and give more value to Mary Jo's life than the Kennedys did.
10340	6	a	Taking every scene on an individual basis, it is often madly brilliant, but put it all together, and it is a pretentious, incoherent mess.
10341	3	a	Carol is a voluptuous, simmering, shimmering, careless whisper of a film that could easily have been written entirely for Cate Blanchett.
10342	3	a	Sometimes beauty and charm are enough to turn a middling movie into pure ambrosia. Diane Lane has plenty of both ...
10343	0	a	An exceptionally well made movie with strong performances, most notably those by Cate Blanchett and Tilda Swinton, both at the top of their games.
10344	9	a	The whole thing reeks of sequelitis, with an emphasis on the rude and crude.
10345	5	a	Star-studded cliched rubbish
10346	6	a	The filmmakers... opt for a mostly witty Sundance-branded coming-of-age sitcom featuring lucky good looks, accelerated maturity, sexual ease, quick wits, cooperative facial hair and a distinct lack of teenage awkwardness.
10347	3	a	While not the strongest story of the whole saga, Cowboy Bebop: The Movie is an extended dip in a uniquely mind-bending pool.
10348	4	a	The notion of horror movie as thrill ride is cannily literalized in the bravura amusement-park opening sequence...
10349	2	a	A unique, abiding and eye-opening glance at the boisterous life of a legendary fashion designer who vehemently seeks pleasure only to be disappointed by its fleeting and faulty nature.
10350	3	a	Toy's House is what Moonrise Kingdom might have been like if the director's played-out style and monotone quirkiness had not interfered with its similar tale.
10351	3	a	A likeable cast with crackling chemistry, plus genre mash-ups, tough/clever wisecracks, and expert seasoning of action with humor and humor with action.
10352	4	a	In the second half of the film, the wind starts to go out of Spielberg's sails.
10353	3	a	It's not high art -- but it IS pretty damn funny, and sometimes that's more than good enough.
10354	3	a	Still sizzles like a capsaicin-spiked grindhouse meatloaf baked and served just under the wire of its sell-by date.
10355	9	a	While this doesn't breathe new life into the genre, or even the series itself, the blueprint was certainly there to have constructed a much better model.
10356	7	a	So much promise, so little follow-through.
10357	6	a	"They could have subtitled it ""Dial M for Muddle."
10358	9	a	Mr. Zombie's encyclopedic approach to the genre results in a crowded, frenzied film in which no single idea is developed to a satisfying payoff.
10359	3	a	In a film where dialogue comes at a premium, Van Sant allows his camera to do the talking, and when it rests too long on one subject, the commentary feels like overstatement. Elsewhere, 'Paranoid Park' is eloquent in its terseness.
10360	4	a	Good as a season finale, shaky as a stand-alone movie.
10361	0	a	...a clarion call for the legitimacy of imagination - not only in stories, but in the real world.
10362	3	a	Moore is the real reason Still Alice works. She's so natural and free of vanity. She doesn't telegraph the tragedy of her situation. It's a quiet performance and the uncertainty of how present Alice is undercuts everything, even the joyful moments.
10363	1	a	A documentary with the power to affect even the most jaded of moviegoers.
10364	3	a	Philomena Lee's true-life story and the marvelous movie Philomena raise the same question. What would Jesus do with an unwed mother? I doubt he'd make her do laundry.
10365	9	a	The title could easily apply to star Sarah Jessica Parker, for how such a charmless actor has maintained such career longevity and popularity is a marvel.
10366	5	a	Haiku MacFarlane should have Watched Blazing Saddles instead of remaking it. 
10367	9	a	As dull as its title is interesting, 'Aliens in the Attic' is far from out-of-this-world.
10368	3	a	At least three of the spots make the hour and a half worthwhile through an addicting blend of hilarity and beauty.
10369	3	a	Its portrayal of civilisation as an impossibly intricate, crucially flawed equation, about to buckle and snap, is sinuously compelling.
10370	0	a	The movie will happily repay multiple viewings.
10371	5	a	If you dropped a feather and Letters to Juliet from a tall building simultaneously, which one would hit the ground first? It's lightweight and lazy, an outline for a movie.
10372	4	a	A riveting and multidimensional examination of the subprime mortgage meltdown and its devastating impact on homeowners from poor African-Americans to wealthy Californians with swimming pools.
10373	6	a	A stylishly-made but tediously pedantic lecture on the evils of European imperialism. 
10374	0	a	Surprisingly funny and wickedly smart, this romantic dramedy soars.
10375	4	a	At least Dickie Roberts is a good dozen jokes apart from being a one-joke movie. And it's a good thing Spade penned the premise as fiction before Fox tried to pass it off as a reality show.
10376	1	a	While most may be familiar with the broadstrokes of this event, the script is still rivetting storytelling.
10377	5	a	Wilson riffs hard and has his moments, but can't save a comedy with not enough laughs.
10378	4	a	This movie is very, very scary.
10379	4	a	For pure camp, intentional or otherwise, this is right up there with The Rocky Horror Picture Show.
10380	2	a	This is the Veronica Mars fans have been dying for, and if that means non-fans aren't going to have as good a time as fans at the movie then screw them, they should be fans in the first place.
10381	3	a	Hats off the director Disney and screenplay writer Bill Haney for having the courage to expose racism as the sick and sad shadow that is still alive and well in America.
10382	6	a	"The creamy, handsome look of ""Albert Nobbs"" matches Close's work, but the film falls short in most other aspects."
10383	4	a	Lucy Walker's film is at its most incisive when it explores the historical development of son music.
10384	3	a	Playful and energized enough to keep an audience guessing.
10385	3	a	Traveling the world, solving a mystery, hunting people down, killing some of those people...everything that you want James Bond to do. Then it takes an interesting turn.
10386	4	a	A modest Hawn-like romance for a new generation.
10387	5	a	Thanks to Duplass's 'regular guy' appeal and Wilde's ability to play the girl-next-door with the same aplomb as possessed siren, The Lazarus Effect proves believable enough to be entertaining but a little too bland to leave much of a scar.
10388	3	a	Tamara Jenkins has made a movie about something that lots of people are going through but nobody wants to deal with, not even in life, much less in entertainment. And she's done it fearlessly, with the right mix of humor and horror.
10389	4	a	Thomas makes for a competent if unspectacular feature director and the writing is characteristically sassy, even if it can't compete with the show's finest hours.
10390	6	a	A flashy and intermittently unique biopic.
10391	8	a	Given the effect Max Payne has, by the close you may feel that they've misspelled the hero's last name.
10392	7	a	Wanna see something really scary? See something else.
10393	1	a	It's hard to deny the fact that, all this considered, it's a work of art, even with that title.
10394	0	a	Only the Coen brothers could make a film so impressively brutal and yet so understated as this. It helps that the set-up is so fiendishly simple. Blood simple, you might say.
10395	6	a	A true Amistad movie should be a highly emotional tale about the courage and will of the Africans themselves not the American-centered courtroom drama that Spielberg has made.
10396	3	a	Sacha Baron Cohen at Harvard, as character Ali G: 'Some of you has probably never even seen a black man before, like that great civil rights leader, Martin Luther Vandross...'
10397	3	a	It's always exciting when a film that plays with cinematic language can squeeze in among the flotsam and jetsam of repetitive mediocrity.
10398	6	a	Sato seems to be trying to make several different movies at once, and none of them comes through strongly enough to carry the film.
10399	3	a	Loach has made more memorable films, such as Raining Stones and Ladybird Ladybird, but his dramatic sense remains strong and his social conscience is absolutely unstoppable.
10400	4	a	Great performance by Samuel Jackson but predictable as a slam dunk.
10401	6	a	... it never truly takes off in the direction that it was aiming for, with the execution lacking energy and passion to see the material through to the end.
10402	3	a	Ultimately, No Country For Old Men is a very strong film that's just a couple of bad decisions away from being a masterpiece.
10403	4	a	The shaking and almost random cutting destroy the movie's timing and humor, though Smith is skilled enough to sneak a few laughs through.
10404	1	a	Streep and Keaton, in their different styles, find ways to make Lee and Bessie into much more than the expression of their problems.
10405	3	a	What's powerful about Talk to Me is the way it acknowledges how difficult it was for Dewey and Petey to face not only their own dichotomy but their real love for each other.
10406	6	a	This is every bit as insipid as it sounds, but it's also surprisingly innocent and has a most unexpected sweetness.
10407	10	a	Almost everything is wrong with it.
10408	0	a	Raiders of the Lost Ark is my favorite movie. I don't have to tell you why it's great. You know why it's great. Instead, what follows is a list of very personal moments.
10409	2	a	Smart and glossy, but it has too many sluggish moments to maintain its few high points.
10410	5	a	This is Spade's best effort in a long line of really bad solo projects, but the best parts of his film feature washed up actors and have nothing at all to do with him.
10411	3	a	Veteran director Yamada continues to examine issues of duty and loyalty, sharply using matter-of-fact period detail and deep characterisations.
10412	2	a	A loopy fever-dream of a movie that recasts the conventions of noir in a blissed-out psychedelic haze.
10413	4	a	Engrossing western that never got the recognition it deserved
10414	0	a	It is the cream of the crop in the categories of cinematography, editing, art direction, sound mixing, costume design, special visual effects, makeup and original musical score.
10415	8	a	... a ridiculously lame film that has absolutely nothing to say about real life or love.
10416	4	a	Rules of Engagement isn't a bad film, but it's one that is often too dramatically and intellectually inert to warrant a full recommendation.
10417	9	a	I wish I hadn't seen it.
10418	6	a	Like a too-precisely choreographed dance, it feels lifeless.
10419	0	a	Chris Farely at his best.
10420	4	a	"Safety Not Guaranteed"" is eccentric enough to get mistaken for an uplifting fantasy, but it's Plaza who belongs in the penthouse."
10421	3	a	totally wacky, a rite-of-passage romp
10422	5	a	If bad movies were punches, Against the Ropes would land like a perfectly timed round-house haymaker...
10423	0	a	Skilfully directed by Ava DuVernay and featuring a wonderful leading performance from David Oyelowo, Selma pulls back the curtain on a riveting piece of U.S. history.
10424	5	a	"Psychic Damon says: ""A life that's all about death is no life"". We say: A film that's all about death is no film."
10425	3	a	The movie is raw and unexpected and it vividly depicts the Holocaust in all its monstrousness.
10426	3	a	It makes the audience leave the theater in angst. [Full review in Portuguese.]
10427	5	a	...the film grows more and more tedious as it slowly progresses...
10428	5	a	Both exasperatingly vapid and easy to sit through.
10429	3	a	Even if Zhao overstates one or two metaphors, she captures Brady's inner struggle with mesmerising authenticity.
10430	9	a	Director Peter Berg mounts a special-effects extravaganza that's very boring indeed, and doesn't quite deafen us to the inadequacies of the script, while Smith pretends to be a grumpy git but, naturally, winds up begging us to love him.
10431	3	a	"Mark Felt"" is, by necessity, a cooler and quieter film than Neeson's recent run of action movies. But it has a nervous tension all its own, centered on Neeson's strong performance."
10432	4	a	A creative, visually gratifying experience - but requires a suspension of disbelief given the contrivance in the narrative.
10433	6	a	As directed by Donald Petrie, the movie and its characters are amiable and cute when they need to be offbeat and zonked.
10434	1	a	A film so miraculous and so far above its competitors that the Academy Award for Animated Feature Film is no longer a contest.
10435	6	a	"The raucous highlight: a lip-sync video for Bell Biv Devoe's ""Poison"" performed by the women. It drops down into the middle of the film like a grenade that explodes too soon, and it makes everything that comes after... seem like rote tidying up. "
10436	7	a	There is something adorably British about Nick Parks's latest plasticine adventure, Early Man.
10437	4	a	a drag-down, mildly diverting entertainment
10438	2	a	A balanced and devastatingly accurate look at the Bosnian conflict
10439	7	a	This movie would a helluva lot better with paper mache sets.
10440	2	a	I laughed more during The Angry Birds Movie than I have at any film for a while.
10441	3	a	Befitting a story about magicians, The Prestige is certainly tricky and deceitful. But it's also too elegant and classy to resort to cheap third-act revelations as a way of juicing its story.
10442	4	a	Pete Travis' Rashomon retread reads more like a less funny Groundhog Day.
10443	3	a	Ghosts doesn't need gimmicks to sell itself. Titanic's watery grave is awe-inspiring enough.
10444	3	a	...could very well prove to be Brosnan's 'The Sand Pebbles', a standout dramatic performance from an action star looking to be taken seriously.
10445	4	a	Given the resources and talent here, quite a movie might have resulted. But it's so hard to care about this story.
10446	6	a	The latest installment in film's ongoing habit of hooking itself up, Iditarod-like, to man's best friend for a little uplift in the adorability department.
10447	2	a	Hoffman is in fine form here and, despite a long murky stretch, the film works.
10448	5	a	The story's tired, as are the main characters.
10449	1	a	As the James Bond film franchise continues to get a vigorous shaking, consider this critic sufficiently stirred.
10450	5	a	The supreme idiocy on display really wouldn't matter if the film just bothered to acknowledge it.
10451	3	a	"Wry, genial, and not at all interested in jumping on the bandwagon of flash-in-the-pan pop-cultural hipness, ""Rango"" holds an eclectic eye for finding beauty in the unusual."
10452	1	a	Armed with an offbeat intelligence...Team America: World Police is a diabolically spunky punch to the political groin that takes no prisoners... doesn't miss a naughty beat
10453	3	a	Enjoyable, old-fashioned stage-to-screen musical.
10454	6	a	"They're calling ""Veronica Mars"" a movie, but no matter which way you squint at it, it's a TV show."
10455	6	a	Unfortunately, directors Anthony and Joe Russo sometimes push the jokes too hard, relying on tired physical comedy and easy visual jokes.
10456	3	a	A terse, tight, impressively smart package.
10457	3	a	Westfeldt tells what should be an all too familiar tale with a subversively refreshing take on what constitutes love and romance
10458	0	a	The Coens have found the perfect source material to continue their dominance of the crime genre while making a second viewing an absolute must to appreciate all the voices involved.
10459	7	a	Note to Brian Robbins: mocking The Matrix is played out.
10460	8	a	Jonah Mess
10461	0	a	Sean Penn's spellbinding film adaptation of this book stays close to the source.
10462	6	a	The problem is the movie only waltzes in the real world while it tangos and rumbas in the realm of the fantastic and superficial.
10463	7	a	A big nothing, not even hokey enough to watch for the sake of laughing at it.
10464	1	a	At first, the film seems to assure us there's no terrible situation that can't get worse. Then it makes a more sincere, truthful assertion: things always get better.
10465	3	a	It remains an aesthetically filmed blend of off-beat comedy, mind-boggling sci-fi, and subjective storytelling that serves as a singular and timeless piece of cinema.
10466	3	a	For those who have not read the book, there are some significant surprises in store -- while those who have will, I think, be satisfied with this handsome adaptation.
10467	2	a	An enjoyable action flick.
10468	6	a	If you're indifferent to silly revisions of history and bad acting, you may enjoy The Other Boleyn Girl. I'm not, and I didn't.
10469	6	a	A cornball drone of greeting-card sentiment.
10470	3	a	Not cheery, perhaps, but a gorgeously shot and beautifully composed piece that is not as depressing as it might appear.
10471	8	a	Wonderfully dark and moody children's Halloween tale that gently stirs all of the required elements of humour, musical charisma, children's imagination and amazing special effects in a successful simmering pot of entertainment.
10472	7	a	an infomercial that can't end soon enough.
10473	4	a	When it's exciting, it is really exciting.
10474	3	a	Director Lauren Lazin masterfully stitches together bits and pieces of Shakur's interviews to underline the big, Shakespearean themes -- ambition, violence, redemption -- that seemed to define his life.
10475	3	a	Fun Bond flick.
10476	2	a	This grandiose film is visually and emotionally ripe, to the point that juices nearly sweat off the screen.
10477	9	a	Mostly it's shoddy, amateurish, and cheap-looking.
10478	5	a	A drive-through take on mid-life spirituality - with lots of food and travel porn
10479	1	a	Complicated, enigmatic and haunting...easily Eastwood's best film since 'Unforgiven,' and one of the most compelling pictures of the year.
10480	3	a	A contemporary tale of terrorism and intelligence gathering that is as thrilling as it is relevant.
10481	0	a	Another masterpiece from French director Eric Rohmes about the different sides of love.
10482	5	a	Cheesy horror flick, not worth your time
10483	0	a	[Jack's] search may not necessarily be over at the end, but a new one by the audience may have commenced. Any film that makes you question yourself must be doing something right.
10484	1	a	A movie of uncompromising soul, unadulterated funk and unalloyed joy
10485	2	a	Has its powerful moments.
10486	4	a	I saw something, but I'm not exactly sure what it was. One thing's likely: You've never seen a film like Black Snake Moan, and you won't see anything like it in the near future.
10487	4	a	Passes the time in a pleasant way then disappears like a carelessly placed wallet.
10488	6	a	Considering all the talented people involved with Welcome to Mooseport -- including a great cast -- you can't help but wish it were funnier. Even just a little bit.
10489	1	a	Pixar's done it again, etc., etc. It's almost boring at this point.
10490	3	a	The latest Coppola behind the lens has served notice -- it will be interesting to see how she follows up. If pedigree is any indicator, the future holds brightness.
10491	2	a	Carnage Park isn't a perfect film, but it's a fun little ride.
10492	6	a	Exemplifies the lackluster result of exhuming played-out franchises that are better left buried.
10493	7	a	If Feste actually believes that this show is country nirvana, she has no business making a country movie.
10494	5	a	The painfully long and insufferable last act is like being stuck in a bad first-person shooter video game nightmare.
10495	3	a	"The story is pretty simple but the film, like the book, is about the details and this is what attracts to ""Memoirs of a Geisha."
10496	3	a	I can admit it's a well-made film, but that doesn't mean I approve.
10497	6	a	The movie casts around wildly for comic set-pieces, coming up with things like aggressive chipmunks, hostile dolphins and a dad who longs to be naked at all times.
10498	2	a	Another quality film from the Coens. Goodman's best performance.
10499	7	a	Sloppy, choppy, and indifferently assembled, Strange Wilderness is slapdash even by the relaxed standards of its executive producer, Adam Sandler.
10500	3	a	A brave and accomplished study of love and human connections that establishes the young Coppola as one of the most acute talents of her generation.
10501	5	a	When Robin asks, 'Don't we hear this on Sally and Oprah every day?' you may be inclined to agree.
10502	3	a	"Hello, My Name is Doris"" effectively conveys the cruel ambivalence of an ageist society, and despite its formulaic ingredients, the movie responds to that setback with Field's exuberant, virtuoso turn providing the ultimate critical response."
10503	4	a	The stilted and diffuse result is as dramatically compelling as a planning commission meeting.
10504	2	a	Still Alice is rarely anything short of compelling, in part because its sense of progression and scale offers such a distinctively unsentimental take on the terminal-countdown tearjerker.
10505	6	a	Hancock isn't by any means a dead loss, but it could have been a lot better.
10506	4	a	As saccharine movies go, this is likely to cause massive cardiac arrest if taken in large doses.
10507	9	a	Earth goes to war, but Spielberg merely goes back to his aging bag of tricks.
10508	4	a	Just because a story actually happened doesn't mean it will make for compelling cinema. This is a prime example.
10509	3	a	A very sweet film. A freak of nature story, a love story, a surreal drama; Button is at its best reminding us the beauty, miracle, and impermanence of real life.
10510	7	a	Considering how many great films have been influenced by Brooks' earlier work, it's hard to believe how badly this movie fails. 
10511	6	a	...a plodding prequel that's more detached than a separated body limb placed neatly on Lecter's dinner plate...a boorish slice of slaughterhouse cinema.
10512	0	a	Not only one of the best James Bond movies in the five-decade history of the beloved character but it's one of the best action movies of the last decade. 
10513	3	a	It's alive, it's colorful, it's got well-written characters and more than a handful of memorable scenes
10514	3	a	It makes for OK drama all the same, but it's all on the heavy-handed side. Well, subtlety was never Kramer's strong suit.
10515	0	a	Never has the impossible glamour of Cate Blanchett been used to better effect than in Todd Hayne's ravishing and romantic Carol.
10516	4	a	Greatly silly and unexpectedly wise at times.
10517	3	a	...better than anything mainstream that I have seen all year.
10518	4	a	The first two-thirds of this film are utterly riveting... but in the final act... the story threatens to devolve into some sort of eco-thriller. 
10519	6	a	Simpson's dialogue flies like a flat-footed homage to Mamet or Tarantino.
10520	4	a	Like its central character, Woodstock never makes it to the big show. But the lesson seems to be that it's not the destination that matters, it's the trip.
10521	2	a	Cumberbatch gives a performance that is, by turns, awkward, triumphant, and heartbreaking.
10522	2	a	The most competent Ed Wood film ever made.
10523	3	a	The continuing story of everyone's favorite boy wizard is a visual feast -- and darker than the first installment.
10524	5	a	By the time the killings start, it's clear that Ray Wright's screenplay is more interested in following formula than in breaking new ground. 
10525	1	a	Fast, crisp and lively, the film packs a half-dozen stories into two hours with little time for melodrama or sermonizing. The dialogue is quick and sharp; short scenes make powerful points.
10526	6	a	As the character grows sicker and quieter, the drama's energy fades.
10527	5	a	The biggest flaws are in the script, which contains some real howlers.
10528	4	a	"Fey has her moments, and so does ""Whiskey Tango Foxtrot."" But for a performer who still deserves some big-screen respect, her war-movie comedy still feels a little small-screen, a little timid, a little safe."
10529	8	a	See website for more details.
10530	0	a	Relentlessly gripping.
10531	7	a	Succesfully playing a zombie onstage doesn't take the place of a few basic courses in Film School.
10532	6	a	It's The Breakfast Club for middle schoolers with slightly lower-grade angst and a less memorable soundtrack.
10533	4	a	Snake Eyes so quickly disintegrates into formula, and the characters into caricatures, that it completely loses steam by the halfway mark.
10534	5	a	Ang Lee will try anything. In Billy Lynn's Long Halftime Walk that unfortunately includes our patience.
10535	1	a	Not your usual snoozy IMAX documentary.
10536	2	a	The studio should have waited until they had a script with over an hour's worth of material in it.
10537	6	a	If writer-director Vincenzo Natali, storyboard artist for Keanu Reeve's Johnny Mnemonic, were as comfortable with dialogue and dramatizing characters as he is with images, this first feature of his might have worked better.
10538	6	a	Scenes don't build momentum, and I don't think I've ever seen a feature where so many lines of dialogue were delivered by actors hovering off-screen or standing with their backs to the camera.
10539	4	a	A sequel with some bite to it.
10540	7	a	Far less than fantastic.
10541	4	a	Seth Rogen, superhero? It's nearly impossible to wrap the mind around such an outlandish idea, almost on the same level as Sarah Palin as U.S. president or Ricky Gervais as the next recipient of the Golden Globes Lifetime Achievement Award.
10542	6	a	The visual effects, especially those used to enhance the metaphysical elements, are impressive, but the story lacks that certain something.
10543	3	a	On a road trip with his son, the past catches up with a man of few words. His son learns there is a lot more to his father than he ever knew in this warm, funny film that shows the best and worst in people.
10544	1	a	A playful metaphysical comedy that embraces the spiritual uplift of our connections with others amidst the muck of separations that characterize our world.
10545	2	a	Fortunately, Moore manages to find many such interesting cinematic diversions to spice things up.
10546	2	a	If you're a Jane Austen fan, your sense and sensibility will demand you check this out.
10547	2	a	The indie film has a fresh feel.
10548	0	a	Mann's last western, and his most disturbing foray into the genre.
10549	0	a	Not being able to follow the plot grants a kind of freedom, allowing you to soak up the vivid atmosphere and dwell on the performances, wordplay and copious visual gags without needing to figure who's doing what and/or to whom.
10550	4	a	With its latest movie, Enchanted, Disney is having some fun at its own expense. Gentle fun, it has to be said.
10551	4	a	When a woman who looks like Diane Lane has to use the internet to find a date, something has gone horribly wrong with our world
10552	6	a	The film doesn't come to life until too late in the game, when it takes the original tack of exploring the housing crisis through abandoned backyard swimming pools...
10553	1	a	The movie is a delightful and imaginative parody of Star Trek.
10554	6	a	It's not worth the expenditure of energy, really.
10555	5	a	Never title a movie the same way a junior high girl signs her yearbook.
10556	6	a	Shows that smutty and adorable don't mix.
10557	1	a	A merciless thriller, threateningly beautiful to look at and eerie to behold.
10558	3	a	There are a couple of scenes of pure, sentimental genius, as well as appealingly boggled turns by Rudd and Wilson.
10559	3	a	clever, consistently funny and unexpectedly poignant to boot
10560	3	a	Excellent, accurate, smart analysis of sexual harrassment in the workplace.
10561	0	a	An astonishing and incredibly entertaining movie about the power of forgiveness, the importance of sports, the art of transformative leadership, and the reconciliation of the races.
10562	1	a	Though Spielberg once almost took the helm, the picture that we have here indicates that Marshall was the perfect man to bring Arthur Golden's amazing best seller to the screen.
10563	8	a	Melodramatically absurd and technically inept...well-intentioned but dull.
10564	4	a	Um excelente trabalho de Tommy Lee Jones.
10565	6	a	A disappointing mishmash.
10566	9	a	Avoid Like Plague.
10567	4	a	A formulaic but amusing tale of a loser who becomes a winner by losing himself in the service of others.
10568	8	a	The movie is a series of glum interrogation scenes that lead nowhere special, with a not-quite-sci-fi urban murkiness that makes it look like someone was trying to shoot Blade Runner in Cleveland.
10569	5	a	This movie is in desperate need of a pulse.
10570	1	a	A stunning visual and a culturally informative film.
10571	10	a	You'll feel like the one who's being held hostage.
10572	3	a	A sumptuous tale of two women who don't always play by those rules.
10573	3	a	Frances Mcdormand delivers a brave, unapologetic performance that commands the screen.
10574	3	a	There's a kinda/sorta plot going on here that strings together a bunch of gags, which work more often than not.
10575	6	a	A serviceable comedy about women who want to 'have it all,' 'I Don't Know How She Does It' takes a look at a working mother who faces the challenge of balancing her career and her family.
10576	6	a	Guys are idiots, lower your standards? I can't tell you how sick I am of seeing this moronic message beaten into women's heads in cinematic 'romance' after romance.
10577	4	a	It's a decent comeback for Soderbergh, though not one that fires on all cylinders.
10578	3	a	Here's a movie with an origin that's almost more interesting than that of its 'Astro Boy' hero
10579	0	a	Strangely compelling and inspiring...
10580	4	a	Like its cinematic kin, Frost/Nixon and Doubt, this, too, is a delicately crafted, prestige project whose translation to screen doesn't deliver the original's amazements.
10581	5	a	An insipid and conventional melodrama, strictly academic in execution. [Full review in Spanish]
10582	3	a	"Inherent Vice"" is an aggressively weird movie, which you should take not as a warning but as a compliment and an invitation to see it, to let its stoner vibes wash all over you."
10583	3	a	It's safe to describe Jindabyne as a haunted movie.
10584	9	a	Bad bad bad, stunningly bad.
10585	1	a	"Call Me by Your Name"" is enough to make you move to the town of Crema, even if your rational self realizes the director Luca Guadagnino trades in a heightened, miragelike state of mythic yearning."
10586	6	a	As the intended start of a franchise, The Bourne Identity is a bit of a bust.
10587	4	a	Meet the Fockers is frequently funny, but it turns a bit too cruel in the third act to be as worthy a sequel to its predecessor as it could have been
10588	1	a	"First Reformed"" is an amazing examination of faith, a film that stays with you long after you have left the theater."
10589	1	a	A brilliant balance between true-life accuracy and movie-time excitement.
10590	1	a	A digital hamster takes on Pixar's industry domination - and kicks butt.
10591	4	a	Muriel is a splendidly crafted character, acted with a grace that made me care about her life. She deserved something more cohesive than this jittery wedding.
10592	6	a	You may feel like taking a vow of abstinence yourself -- at least from Hollywood youth-sex comedies.
10593	0	a	You can't fault it as smart entertainment, which eschews parody to make a sincere tribute that also serves as cogent current commentary.
10594	3	a	Even a second level Almodovar is better than most other people. 
10595	9	a	The real man-made monster in I, Frankenstein is the film itself, a ridiculous good-versus-evil story enrobed in a pastiche of religious symbolism and stodgy mythology and set in a world created in a computer special effects lab.
10596	6	a	Screenwriter/director Goran Dukic can't quite decide on a tone. The film is at times lighthearted, almost effervescent, and then it's so dark that it becomes depressingly bleak.
10597	6	a	Whether Meryl Streep deserved an Oscar nomination may be debatable, but what's beyond dispute is that scripter Richard LaGravenese and director Clint Eastwood have actually made a better, more enjoyable film than the schmaltzy literary source.
10598	6	a	The film's hectic pace and flow has more in common with design of a kids' educational TV show, and although the information seems sometimes chaotic. it is always lively, thought-provoking, and inspirational.
10599	0	a	The Expendables is more than just your average action movie; it is the action movie of the year uniting the grittiness and soul of the old genre with the special effects and coolness of the new genre. See it.
10600	7	a	One Night at McCool's is too high-brow to be low-rent and too low-brow to be considered worthy.
10601	1	a	American Hustle offers a, crowd-pleasing experience - one with profound social commentary, laugh-out-loud comedy, and even unexpected moments of compassion to boot.
10602	1	a	Heineman and screenwriter Arash Amel remind the audience not just of the humanism that drives so many reporters, but also the extreme danger they put themselves in to bring us the truth.
10603	7	a	Hitchcock offers juicy roles to two of the finest actors on the planet.
10604	4	a	It was thought that George A. Romero would save the weakening horror genre. Instead, he joined it.
10605	3	a	Rio Bravo is everything you likely ever imagined a western to be, and a little bit more.
10606	6	a	Jodie Foster's fiercely intelligent performance drives this disappointing thriller, whose taut, carefully constructed first half is sadly negated by its implausible and -- worst of all -- unengaging conclusion.
10607	3	a	Actually quite good. This is a nice tense political thriller that sticks fairly closely to history.
10608	3	a	Emotionally engaging, sharply written and superbly directed drama with terrific performances from Philip Seymour Hoffman and Laura Linney.
10609	3	a	The beauty of the core story tramples the moments where the Irish-set drama sinks into blarney.
10610	7	a	It's a shame the actors have to spoil cinematographer Robert Richardson's artistry by reciting the drivel that passes for dialog.
10611	4	a	The streamlined plot is nothing new, but the physical comedy and trademark Smith glibness work their charm.
10612	3	a	The movie is aware of its cheesiness, one reason it works so well. It's an exploitation flick that knows what it wants to do, and it gets the job done expertly.
10613	2	a	It lacks the humor of Annie Hall. It lacks the depth of Manhattan. But it manages to entertain, mainly as an homage to Paris - a romp through the city's intellectual and artistic history. 
10614	0	a	Fascinating allegory with war, death themes and little boy who won't grow up.
10615	10	a	No comment needed.
10616	4	a	Ryan Murphy brings Elizabeth Gilbert's best-selling self-realization memoir to the big screen as a glossy, Julia Roberts starring travelogue that gives more insight into where to get a great pizza than the benefits of striving for enlightenment.
10617	3	a	Project Nim, a fascinating and in many ways tragic documentary, takes us back to one of the high-water marks of the apes-are-people-too era.
10618	2	a	Lesser Aardman but a pleasant little treat.
10619	5	a	The characters are all flash and emptiness, but so is the story.
10620	2	a	Without reaching the heights of the filmography of the remarkable Japanese director, it is a beautiful, sensitive and enjoyable work. [Full Review in Spanish]
10621	0	a	dark, tart, and oddly joyful
10622	6	a	Despite its big battle scenes and epic craftsmanship, Ridley Scott's Gladiator lacks the spirit and the true heart of a legendary epic; revisit Spartacus and Ben Hur on video for the real McCoy.
10623	6	a	But Bartkowiak somehow thinks he's involved in the fight, and so he gets excited and does everything wrong. He moves in too close, shakes the camera around a lot and cuts every half-second, rendering the action nearly unwatchable.
10624	2	a	Eminem gives a focused, intelligent performance.
10625	6	a	For a bad movie, Flight of the Phoenix is highly entertaining.
10626	4	a	Hitchcock is a film that constantly proclaims its importance but never lives up to it with a light, almost comical tone clashing against the myth of Hitchcock as a talented albeit troubled mind.
10627	9	a	About as funny as discovering that you have cancer, AIDS and a brain tumor all on the same day.
10628	6	a	The film is completely forgettable, frequently funny and weirdly satisfying in a Jersey Loser Gets Respect kind of way.
10629	3	a	"Technology can be tough to toss into kids' movies. The way ""The Emoji Movie"" did it was cynical and cold. The web of ""Ralph,"" however, has smarts and soul."
10630	6	a	A sermon much more than it is a movie.
10631	4	a	We live in a winner-take-all culture, and Radio suggests there are more important things in life.
10632	2	a	Think of L'Auberge Espagnole, a French comedy-drama about a gang of international exchange students living together in Barcelona, as Friends -- the International Edition.
10633	3	a	A part hypnotic, part profound, part send-up meditation on our financially imploding time.
10634	1	a	A powerful, intoxicating spiritual drama with a swift, delicate emotional core and fascinating characters.
10635	4	a	This is a movie that strives for profound statements and eye-opening revelations, but it often crosses that delicate line into obviousness and the kind of narrative hokum that no respectable scientist would accept as truth.
10636	0	a	Scorsese has sparked more spiritual thinking with this film than he could have by going into the priesthood
10637	6	a	It is as if Cohen had a list of ideas he wanted to incorporate, but no real sense of how to articulate them, so they all wind up in a big, messy stew.
10638	5	a	Not much will shock kids, especially those who have read the books, but I have to think there are better choices out there.
10639	1	a	In Carol, all the elements dovetail perfectly to create a movie that is as irresistible as its title character. The movie has an allure that is almost trancelike, mimicking for the viewers the inescapable attraction experienced by the two main characters.
10640	6	a	[Director] Twohy eventually paints himself into a corner with an explanation that's fatally far-fetched. By the end, you're convinced he'll try anything, no matter how illogical, to hold the audience's attention.
10641	1	a	Bewildered, mildly optimistic, holding out the hope of salvation in spite of everything in a blasted, empty landscape, War of the World is, in the end, and perhaps despite its intentions, a fairly tentative assertion of hope for the future.
10642	3	a	There is no way that the story of Vazante ... could end well. The genuine shock is how badly and horrifically it does end for all of these characters.
10643	1	a	It is clear by now Chinese director Zhang Yimou is a master. How can I tell? Well, like Hitchcock, Wilder, Hawks, Kurosawa, et al, he has an innate ability to make whatever genre he's working in distinctly his own.
10644	3	a	Carol is a fine, elegant melodrama -- nothing more and nothing less.
10645	3	a	Better than you remember.
10646	5	a	Kelly is unable to give the movie the kind of pacing that would make us laugh and shock us simultaneously, because he's too infatuated with an aura of hand-me-down gloom.
10647	4	a	To borrow a phrase from the Simpsons, it's just a bunch of stuff that happened.
10648	4	a	doesn't know when to take a step back and call it quits. 
10649	0	a	The film is so good to look at and listen to that, as with some operas, the story is almost beside the point, serving primarily to get us from one spectacular scene to another.
10650	3	a	Shults ... is a good filmmaker who knows how to get the most out of a limited budget and a stale situation.
10651	4	a	This is latter-day Disney doing what it does best: simultaneously playing to the kids with big action, slapstick comedy and spectacle while their parents get knowing nods to a more sophisticated adult worldview.
10652	9	a	This is the one where the big rubber shark gets to attack an aircraft, but that's far from being the only silly thing about this preposterous fourth entry in the series.
10653	0	a	Daggers is a jaw-dropping spectacle that outclasses 'Crouching Tiger'
10654	3	a	The movie has an immense charm that sneaks up on you. Ultimately, it's a delicate ode to love and honor -- and to writing and reading.
10655	0	a	The film is at once heartfelt and funny, farcical and sincere, and packed with performances that pull off that difficult balancing act. In short, it's a masterpiece.
10656	5	a	Friedkin remains an expert technician to this day, but it's difficult to understand his enthusiasm for this seemingly juvenile exercise in trailer-trash excess.
10657	3	a	Succeeds at rendering an irascible man sympathetic.
10658	3	a	After suffering through a summer crammed with TV shows being remade into movies, it's refreshing to see a movie based on a TV show that is so entertaining that it actually makes you want to go and see the show of which the movie was created. 
10659	2	a	A movie of observation and discovery that gives its audience plenty of time to think. Not everyone considers this type of experiential film a fun night of entertainment.
10660	7	a	Maybe this chick flick is sweet, but it's also slow, silly, and phony.
10661	3	a	one fascinating creep show
10662	1	a	'The Rider' is a sensitive feature that should be seen and appreciated. It is an original vision about a small segment of America that - at times - almost feels like another nation, and one worth visiting.
10663	3	a	Call of the Canyon is one of those movies you can watch on a lazy weekend afternoon and get instant smiles.
10664	5	a	Pitched between horror and comedy, Secret Window turns out to be neither terribly scary nor especially funny.
10665	7	a	Telemarketers should target fans of the movie because anyone who can buy Cook as a good-hearted dentist who travels to Guatemala to help sick children will buy anything.
10666	1	a	Skyfall is not simply one of the very best Bond films, it's one of the year's best movies, period.
10667	1	a	There are any number of moments that fans of French cinema could only have dreamed of ever happening.
10668	4	a	The over-length isn't unnecessary - this is a lush film meant to be savored - but even the intentional redundancies start to feel redundant.
10669	4	a	There's a delightfully unfashionable cheesiness about John Carter, a film for all the family, but in particular sci-fi fantasy geeks and older gentlemen who have never been able to relinquish the spiffing derring-do of Burroughs.
10670	1	a	It has a power that cannot be denied. And its misogyny is only skin deep.
10671	3	a	The plot isn't very smart or exciting, but the action, including the scene in which the house is demolished, is spectacular.
10672	4	a	The result is too much formula and not enough human interest.
10673	8	a	You'll be reminded of why Nicholson became one of the biggest stars of his generation.
10674	6	a	Ryan seems to be having fun, at least: she speaks with a breathy working-class accent that's part Lauren Bacall, part Teamster.
10675	6	a	[Verhoeven] has always had a skill for storytelling, however questionable and tasteless the materials; but here he is hopelessly defeated by Ezsterhas' talky, slow-moving, and derivative script.
10676	5	a	I suspect this boorish, crude, often vulgar British comedy lost a great deal of its jolly credence whilst crossing the Atlantic.
10677	1	a	...when it comes to packaging in thrills and chills, this is by far the most balanced, most entertaining and most audacious picture of the series.
10678	6	a	...tries mightily to be cute and cuddly, and in this regard it succeeds...at least for kids.
10679	5	a	While fans of J.R.R. Tolkien's novels and The Lord of the Rings movies will find plenty to enjoy and marvel over, non-believers may find themselves getting bored and bemused by the unnecessarily drawn-out story.
10680	6	a	What's missing here is Almodovar's most distinguishing characteristic: compassion.
10681	6	a	The momentary flashes of authenticity can't save the film from its disingenuous slushiness
10682	4	a	"There are so many in-jokes and silly cameos that it's easy to look past the fact that ""Veronica Mars"" feels not so much like a cinematic experience, but an extended TV show on the big screen."
10683	3	a	It's in the Magnolia/Short Cuts vein and, although it's not as good as those classics, the characters and their dilemmas are absorbing.
10684	4	a	There's not enough here for me to recommend it without reservations to anyone outside of that narrow target audience.
10685	4	a	A breezy crime picture with an unforced sentimental underbelly.
10686	4	a	Something Wild is undoubtedly a minor work in the oeuvre of all its major players, yet it is never less than charming, and at times is almost inspired. 
10687	6	a	"Somewhere in ""The Cloverfield Paradox"" is an excellent sci-fi thriller but one that's in desperate need of sharpening. It's no disaster, like Netflix's recent ""Bright,"" but it tries too hard to give something to everyone and ends of unsatisfying..."
10688	0	a	The crossed-signals and secret selfishness of a bad marriage are the sour heart of Revolutionary Road. And it is devastating.
10689	4	a	It's a strange feeling to come out of a movie aimed at kids, much less a sequel to something like Cheaper by the Dozen, and not feel as though I need a shower and a vasectomy.
10690	4	a	In addition to his incredible martial arts skills, Chan also proves to be a master at comedic timing. His innocent sensibility is a nice match to his physical talent, keeping him as vulnerable as he is powerful.
10691	3	a	Just trust this: see it. You'll be treated to some laugh-out-loud humor, a lot of heart and some outstanding performances.
10692	3	a	Cedric Klapisch takes the old cliches of culture clash... and turns them into a vision of the new European Union as communal household.
10693	3	a	Does absolutely nothing new in a refreshingly fun way.
10694	1	a	The oddest major studio release of the year, and one of the most admirable.
10695	0	a	This riotously funny motion picture, this superlative small-town comedy, is also one of the wisest ever to burst from a big-time studio.
10696	9	a	I give it a week.
10697	3	a	Though it doesn't reek of originality, Unaccompanied Minors manages to keep familiar routines entertaining and find fresh ways to revive the laughs fossilized inside old gags.
10698	2	a	A slighter version of The Hustler, on a different sort of felt
10699	0	a	McDonagh's genius is evident in the way he tugs and pushes the boundaries of good behaviour, often providing just enough motivation to mess with our sense of what's justified, and when.
10700	6	a	Breakin' All The Rules has moments when it is very good, but it doesn't maintain that high level throughout the movie.
10701	0	a	After a summer of brain-numbing junk, Nurse Betty seems like a reprieve.
10702	2	a	Uses a target of modern day cynicism to tell a story about the importance of rejecting modern day cynicism.
10703	10	a	As they walk through the desert, I was hoping a pack of wild, rabid camels would attack them and eat them to get this movie over with.
10704	3	a	Close, in one of her greatest performances, is quiet, still, almost invisible to those around her. It's not a stunt or an impersonation, it's a perfect realization of what someone in her position might endure just to eat. 
10705	9	a	It's a good device either for science-fiction or romantic comedy. But since there's no intelligence to drive the jokes, the gimmick turns tiresome quick.
10706	9	a	It doesn't take long to realize that the only thing this movie's diving for is dollars -- yours.
10707	9	a	Now I know what it feels like to be nodding off.
10708	6	a	Brief Interviews is interesting in pieces, but overwhelming in its totality.
10709	3	a	The chemistry between the two charismatic young actors remains plausible and appealing.
10710	4	a	These are full-bodied performances, with Peter's ardency and Gloria's kittenishness signaled in a hungry look, a wag of the eyebrows. Fittingly, the film's best scene needs no words
10711	9	a	Self-absorbed, one-dimensional characters cast adrift in a plain-wrapper story about three sisters in search of themselves and each other do not an enjoyable film make.
10712	3	a	Gorgeous, lyrical story of first love and desire during an Italian summer hits you right in the heart.
10713	1	a	"Hereafter"" is Clint Eastwood's celebration of life in all its transitional forms, death included. "
10714	3	a	Always pleasant to watch even as the plot bites off more than it can chew.
10715	3	a	...we can forgive Spielberg his indulgences when the outcome is so profoundly moving.
10716	3	a	This film may be all over the map, but at least it takes viewers to some interesting places.
10717	6	a	Those previously unfamiliar with the work of Valentino will find it to be sporadically interesting. Everyone else, especially fashion aficionados, will find it to be superficial, unprovocative and bland.
10718	2	a	...a sharp satire in a time when we need as many laughs as we can get at our own expense.
10719	2	a	Mild comedy rules 'Crowne'
10720	1	a	Although it sometimes runs short on invention, it makes up for it in style, execution and a cheery disposition that's positively infectious.
10721	4	a	I'm no holdout about the reality of global warming, but fictionalizing and anthropomorphizing animal adventures to make the point and then calling it a documentary puts these filmmakers in a league with pre-Sicko Michael Moore.
10722	5	a	No matter how many times she pushes her specs up her nose Beckinsale is never going to be believable as a nerd. Bale as a psychiatrist: it's easier to envisage him as Batman.
10723	1	a	Hypnotic beauty and emotion reveal the Spanish director to be still at the height of his powers.
10724	5	a	The film has its moments, particularly when in satire mode. It's just too bad that not as much fun and imagination went into crafting and then fleshing out the main, predictable plot.
10725	3	a	Odd, but brilliantly so. It's a small film that feels big, a period drama that looks modern, defying comparison to anything but Nolan himself.
10726	6	a	Peyton Reed's The Break-Up proves there is nothing particularly funny or charming about two people splitting up, even if the couple is played by Vince Vaughn and Jennifer Aniston.
10727	3	a	The title is about as spot on as you can get and this is ultimately a film that raises the search for beauty in this world to a stylish art.
10728	5	a	Tripp is such a stud that he has to beat women off with a stick. Or, rather, with his parents -- This isn't just idiotic, it's indefensible. It's also the picture's premise.
10729	9	a	It is an utter disaster; a staggeringly incompetent and woefully misjudged exercise.
10730	1	a	Selma presents a multidimensional portrayal of Dr. King, flaws and all, and it makes us wonder how far we've actually come today.
10731	9	a	Martin and Levy mug for their close-ups and then retire to their trailers while the stunt doubles do the really hard work.
10732	3	a	In the title role, Jackson holds himself like an exclamation point.
10733	4	a	Wall-E, it's not, but its target kiddie audience will have no problem whatsoever adopting Bolt.
10734	5	a	Feels as though everyone involved forced themselves to grit their teeth and get on with it. 
10735	1	a	This is the sort of film we're intended to wallow in, barely coming up for air -- so dazzled, we barely need to breathe.
10736	8	a	The greatest disappointment of all is that the ending promises an unfortunate sequel. That comes off like a threat.
10737	3	a	Another great departure for Smith to put his charm and popularity to the test, offering more than a few solid laughs within an original superhero premise.
10738	4	a	We should never limit visionary directors, but ambition and technical achievement alone don't make a film. The thing has to be watchable too.
10739	9	a	This is akin to The Three Stooges meet The Farrelly Brothers but taken down about a dozen notches or so in terms of intelligence, creativity or imagination.
10740	5	a	Begins to feel like The Break and Enter Club.
10741	1	a	The plot is about clearing Logan. But the movie itself is about Veronica coming to terms with her identity.
10742	6	a	A melodramatic potboiler that stretches the boundaries of believability far more than any one movie can withhold.
10743	9	a	Yet another battle-filled and self-indulgent film by Peter Jackson.
10744	4	a	Spielberg's considerable talent is not quite enough to unearth it
10745	9	a	Movies like this could start giving sports a bad name.
10746	3	a	Excellent performances, a great soundtrack, and the Hughes' technical virtuosity make it worth a look.
10747	4	a	Cheap effects and gratuitous displays of nudity only heighten the film's delirious demeanor.
10748	6	a	The result in Meet the Spartans is less classic Mel Brooks than middling Best Week Ever.
10749	4	a	The film's lures, while undeniable, are synthetic, and we never do learn what fuels all the greed besides pints of beer.
10750	1	a	All the primary players are wonderful.
10751	4	a	"I could think of two dozen ""Next Generation"" episodes that are a lot better than this flick."
10752	0	a	Jimmy Stewart never did finer work, and Hitchcock's masterpiece, though its meaning may be lost on many, reveals a man at his most obsessed.
10753	5	a	Please, shoot me now.
10754	3	a	David Oyelowo breathes such life into it and makes you feel like you're seeing this person for the first time.
10755	4	a	The absolute best I can say about this movie is that I didn't hate it, I didn't mind watching it and I see no reason to ever watch it again.
10756	3	a	Solid B-movie fun.
10757	6	a	Nothing in this film has the visceral or emotional impact that would make it more than an average thriller. It just goes through the bland, mass-produced motions.
10758	6	a	Love, Simon is touching as a gesture. As entertainment, it's nothing Degrassi hasn't done better.
10759	3	a	The overall sense of righteous, non-violent anger is palpable.
10760	1	a	Watching Amy Berg's powerful documentary Deliver Us from Evil is a wrenching experience; her subjects reveal to the camera almost unbearable levels of anguish, and its audience walks away feeling both numbness and rage.
10761	5	a	The film is lazily content to simply put its female characters through the potty-mouthed, gross-out comedy ringer.
10762	3	a	It's a relief to discover that Snakes on a Plane actually is what we hoped it would be: a really, really enjoyable bad movie.
10763	3	a	A joy to watch these characters.
10764	0	a	The film's genius is that it never settles into a steady track. Shots are often held too long or too short, by orthodox rules. Piano runs suddenly ambush the soundtrack.
10765	6	a	Comes off more like a female midlife crisis fantasy than a substantive search for knowledge and inner peace.
10766	4	a	Super swoony romantic fluff that's fun for tweens.
10767	9	a	Mars doesn't need moms, and Earth doesn't need this movie
10768	6	a	Maybe fans of the game will be okay with the cinematic adaptation but for those who aren't new to Max and his world, this isn't an impressive introduction. Clunky action, chaotic plotting, and embarrassing dialogue are not ways to impress newcomers.
10769	9	a	Awful and intolerably tedious, everyone connected with this abomination should hang their heads in shame.
10770	5	a	The story...is limp and preposterous at the same time. The action is lethargic. Jolie's performance is smug...
10771	4	a	[Attempts to] manipulate the audience's emotions and get them to feel something doesn't work, because it comes across as preachy rather than emotional and moving.
10772	4	a	"This scandal-plagued project overcame the odds to deliver an earnestly felt actioner. ... Thankfully, [it] isn't another historically revisionist, grim-dark bleak-a-thon like, say, ""The Revenant"" and ""The Hateful Eight."" "
10773	4	a	Yi and Cera are both excellent, though the film is considerably hampered by the lack of any real chemistry between them and their romance fails to convince as a result.
10774	3	a	I found Cohen's quest to be interesting, but it sure made me uncomfortable to watch him writing around and screaming in pain every few minutes. Then again, then the search for truth is often painful, and so is math, for some of us.
10775	1	a	Highly innovative.
10776	3	a	A quietly amusing minimalist tale of a grouch who finds he's still capable of pleasure. 
10777	6	a	If you've never seen Firefly, you'll be lost... really, really lost.
10778	6	a	I just never found myself caring quite enough.
10779	2	a	Even with contrived and exaggerated emotional moments and silly action, the movie has haunting images that will stay with you.
10780	2	a	Though very uneven in style and focus . . . the fraught complications among the foursome raise universal issues of freewheeling young love and friendship during wartime.
10781	3	a	This flaw in the justice system might affect anyone, but American Violet shows how easily it can be racialized in a place where hardened social attitudes combine with drugs and poverty to create a permanent black underclass.
10782	4	a	Has many things going for it, but coherence and pacing are not among them.
10783	3	a	An effervescent, witty and absorbing tale lost in time ... Allen rekindles his character love affair that made him such a satisfying film-maker a couple of decades ago ...
10784	1	a	"Love, Simon"" is a sweet, modern romantic comedy that manages to channel the teen movie classics of the late John Hughes, but only the good stuff."
10785	0	a	I kept thinking: WHen is this going to be over? This is not an easy movie to watch.
10786	3	a	Deep into his career, the great American director Clint Eastwood has made a European movie.
10787	9	a	Throughout the film's three interconnected stories, Jim O'Hanlon favors the blunt, maudlin manipulations of Crash.
10788	4	a	It's not going to rock your world, but if you're comfortable with the comic style and the super weapons/crazy guns that would have blown the minds of any Civil War soldier, the action will keep you entertained.
10789	5	a	The film's notion of Austen's great works being nothing loftier than the result of failed puppy love suggests the filmmakers perversely believe that gross oversimplification is a virtue.
10790	2	a	Taken within its genre, it's a terrifically fun ride.
10791	6	a	Landesman doesn't give audiences enough detail to piece together how Felt could have brought down even a White House so crippled by its own ego-driven ineptitude. 
10792	1	a	Cinematographer Marco Pontecorvo's sun-drenched palette would be a perfectly sound reason to see this film, but happily it's not the only one.
10793	3	a	A tense, unsettling plunge into a dark, toxic world where the bleak Scandinavian setting isn't the only thing cold, cruel and unforgiving.
10794	4	a	With fine and affecting performances all round, this is an enjoyably old-fashioned ensemble piece and a solid start to a career behind the camera.
10795	4	a	You know what's fun about old-school dance movies? They're happy. Even when someone is sad, you know that dancing somehow will make things right again.
10796	10	a	By the end ... I fled the theater with ill wishes for everyone involved, including the projectionist and the guy who sold popcorn.
10797	3	a	No other filmmaker has made such a bold statement about the parallels of societal violence that exist between cultures, whether Ancient Eastern, Mafioso, or Urban gangster.
10798	3	a	...an imaginative, often entertaining journey into self-realization that's well worth the trip.
10799	3	a	Most of the easy cliches suggested by that premise are sidestepped, which is almost miraculous.
10800	6	a	Offers little to separate it from the likes of Mad Max, The Road, or numerous others mining the same ground.
10801	0	a	the best film of the year...it's time to see what Bill Murray's really capable of. If he isn't nominated for Oscars for the film, it'll be a disgrace.
10802	6	a	This slapdash animated adventure is a middling diversion at best.
10803	2	a	Downey and Foxx are the top of their acting game - and so is Keener.
10804	6	a	Lethargic and too-long thriller.
10805	2	a	Jessica Chastain and Michael Greyeyes are perfect for their roles, as is the entire supporting cast. Add in great cinematography and musical score and you have a very entertaining film.
10806	4	a	Couples Retreat is a comedy/drama mix, but it's mostly the comedy parts that work.
10807	9	a	Forget the confusion of the he-cows that populate the film; the real problem is that Barnyard is just a lousy, lousy movie.
10808	0	a	Spielberg has directed a film which contains many unforgettable and suspenseful moments. That Jaws was only his second feature film says something about the talent and ingenuity the man possessed even at such an early stage in his career. 
10809	9	a	This is the kind of poor effort that's difficult to forgive.
10810	4	a	Flashy but depressing film.
10811	5	a	Hughes has written, directed and/or produced so many of these films by now that perhaps we can even forgive him for beginning to repeat himself.
10812	7	a	Jonah Hex is not a good movie, but it's a great cautionary tale about what happens when a film loses its way.
10813	5	a	What could have been a gripping tale becomes hammy and overdone.
10814	6	a	"It's fascinating to watch Pattinson actually acting, rather than merely brooding through another ""Twilight"" movie, but he's as trapped in Cronenberg's sterile intellectualism as Packer is in his leather-upholstered hell."
10815	1	a	O'Grady appears in the film, his face showing no sign of shame even as he acknowledges and describes the awful things he did.
10816	4	a	Likeable documentary that serves as a fascinating companion piece to When We Were Kings.
10817	3	a	If Whiskey Tango Foxtrot isn't as incisive or as penetrating as it potentially could have been, for a major studio satirical look at the war in Afghanistan there's still plenty of food for thought here.
10818	3	a	The movie has an almost hypnotic quality; its spare and often beautiful shots seem to sear themselves into the camera's lens.
10819	9	a	The Predator is a thorough grab bag of averageness, made worse by its distinct lack of distinction.
10820	6	a	Game over.
10821	1	a	Offers an irresistible sketchbook filled with prep school memories.
10822	1	a	It's so much fun.
10823	3	a	Susan Sarandon is terrific as the Evil Queen; Timothy Spall pops up like a well-used wart; and James Marsden is the terrifically thick and handsome Prince.
10824	3	a	Credit Westfeldt, who is also the writer and director, with a classic setup for farce, brightly executed.
10825	3	a	A mini-masterpiece that marks the arrival of brave new talents in Gyllenhaal and Kelly. Cult glory beckons.
10826	3	a	It has 'midnight movie' written all over it.
10827	4	a	Much-maligned but sporadically effective...
10828	3	a	Mara's performance stands on its own and likely gives birth to a new star.
10829	0	a	Russell crafts a Baker Act romance playing loose and eccentric with the genre. The banter is spikier, wacky sidekicks have issues, too, and Pat and Tiffany's obstacles aren't fluff. The screws are tighter, and the movie is a ball.
10830	5	a	This is one of those once-seen-immediately-forgotten enterprises which avoids anything memorable or imaginative in favour of fast, functional, charisma-free busy-ness.
10831	5	a	Paul Anderson, the director of such previous sci-fi turkeys as Event Horizon, Soldier and Mortal Combat, is back again with another loud, over-the-top picture.
10832	5	a	A leaden daisy-chain of mistaken identity that holds the interest of the characters much longer than it does the audience's in watching it or mine in explaining it. 
10833	4	a	The movie shifts midstream ... and never regains its footing.
10834	1	a	Lukas Moodyson's debut feature has a grainy, immediate feel that nicely enhances the story's emotional honesty -- a quality that our own popular teen movies have only just begun to embrace.
10835	4	a	It's far too easy to become overwrought and syrupy, and while the new movie has a lot going for it, it does eventually succumb to those watery depths.
10836	1	a	Despite the liberal sprinkling of humor, No Man's Land ends with a very powerful and sure-to-haunt-you statement.
10837	1	a	It's the kind of espionage caper that doesn't get made anymore, a visually sensuous picture made with tender attention to detail and an elegant, understated sense of humor.
10838	0	a	Dark, funny, gripping, and pretty much every reason to fall in love with Frances McDormand if you haven't already.
10839	3	a	Dave Grohl's terrific new doc, Sound City, profiles the studio where some of the greatest music of the past four decades was born.
10840	1	a	"A fanciful film buff's delight, a grim yet glittery corner of Hollywood history given a ""Hollywood"" treatment. No, it's not the literal truth, but as they've said since John Ford's day, ""When the legend becomes fact, print the legend."
10841	3	a	Somehow McDonagh manages to weave in a little bit of hopefulness in this story when it seems like there should be none. 
10842	9	a	Nobody laughed.
10843	0	a	Mr. Haynes is a director of enormous imagination and insight, so for a fragile narrative as exquisite and tender as Chantilly lace, Mr. Haynes fits the emotions to the period like the movements in a symphony.
10844	4	a	An enthusiastic celebration of gothic ghost stories, Crimson Peak is made with the irrepressible visual flair we've come to expect from the Mexican film-maker Guillermo Del Toro, and very nicely performed by a well-chosen cast.
10845	1	a	Entertaining, but just when a good thing becomes too much of a good thing will vary from viewer to viewer.
10846	1	a	A vibrant work that refuses to be relegated to the status of just another Brit biopic appearing in the thick of awards season.
10847	0	a	This is an amazing looking film.
10848	5	a	What success the movie finds is due to the leads' efforts, which are impressively strenuous. They start out with a great premise, and they're clearly ready to run with it. But most of the laughs are stolen right out from under them.
10849	6	a	Comes across as cold to the core, as if untouched by human hands.
10850	4	a	A tense, memorable motion picture...Gere is at the top of his game
10851	6	a	If not for classic FM rock songs overstating the obvious it would be tough to identify We Bought a Zoo as a Cameron Crowe movie. This dramedy could come from anyone who spent the past decade not living up to his promise, and sorely needs a hit.
10852	7	a	The premise falters along with much of the shtick.
10853	1	a	The iguanas are like the frogs at the end of Paul Thomas Anderson's Magnolia, only better.
10854	4	a	Good chemistry - that's about it
10855	5	a	It ... feels utterly neutered, a film with little on the line and a talented cast begging for a little wit and a few jokes. The characters are introduced awkwardly and a strange insertion of an animated dream sequence is entirely out of place.
10856	5	a	Even James Bond can miss his mark.
10857	3	a	It may look like a movie-of-the-week and it certainly has some wincingly bad musical passages, but Invictus is an entertaining movie about a masterful piece of political theater.
10858	1	a	It is not merely amazing -- it reflects an imagination just as elaborate as the technology it employs.
10859	6	a	A throwback to conventional soap-opera romance which would be fortunate to find an enthusiastic audience on afternoon TV.
10860	6	a	Scrambling to find a place in the Coen brothers' shadow, Racz tries too hard to manufacture a sense of zany unpredictability, but each new twist only reveals Sheldon as the soulless opportunist that he is.
10861	1	a	A beautiful little jewel of a movie, and I'm thrilled to realize that Woody Allen still has films this good inside of him.
10862	4	a	The Angry Birds Movie has becomed what could easilly be a ver proftable movie franchise. [Fiull review in Spanish]
10863	0	a	It's the best pick up movie ever.
10864	3	a	Seth MacFarlane often seems determined to make people laugh in ways that they're not proud of -- so mission accomplished, I guess.
10865	3	a	[Boasts] a concise, witty script, an extremely likeable and attractive group of performers, and an abundance of exciting, well-staged kung-fu combat scenes.
10866	6	a	What Failure To Launch doesn't have is the crucial link between McConaughey and Parker suggesting they are indeed meant to be together and worth rooting for, more evidence that chemistry is the one special effect that Hollywood still can't manage.
10867	2	a	Timely tale of an intrepid British war correspondent who was determined to bear witness to places torn by chaos, destruction and death.
10868	1	a	inaugurated the second, more intriguing half of John Wayne's career, enabling him to be cast in roles that were more than just macho posturing and gruff heroism
10869	6	a	Is its purported idiocy put to a worthwhile use, or is this just another stale retreat of MADtv?
10870	7	a	It takes head-to-toe protective padding to survive all the hysteria and tragedy, making the viewing experience more about wincing than Jesus-approved enlightenment.
10871	3	a	While the script contains trite and unbelievable dialogue, the superbly convincing performances make up for these faults.
10872	3	a	[A] lush and ravishing period piece...
10873	9	a	A complete and undeniable bore.
10874	1	a	I wouldn't call American Hustle my kind of movie, but perversely, I have to admit I enjoyed it, primarily because of the twisted logic and wicked cleverness.
10875	4	a	Dustin Hoffman and Hilary Swank could pass for the opposite gender; Close can't. 
10876	9	a	After watching Strange Wilderness, you may want to soak your feet in a tub of live piranhas, just for laughs. You'll find it a lot more fun than anything in this movie.
10877	5	a	You have to wonder what the point is anymore.
10878	3	a	A film that earns the phrase satire, Team America is a film thatt understands neo cons and celebrities are really led by their strings.
10879	6	a	A second-rate jungle adventure that delivers far less than it promises.
10880	3	a	A brisk, engrossing and intelligent thriller.
10881	5	a	The Lazarus Effect is a wag-the-dog film, where the filmmakers had a good idea of how to end the movie, but didn't put the required work into selling the setup.
10882	0	a	inspiring, wacky, and infused with Burton's unique romanticism suffused with, but not subsumed by, a gothic sensibility
10883	5	a	None of it feels remotely believable but also isn't broadly defined enough to be satire, falling in that dull gap in the middle.
10884	5	a	Moral: Never marry anyone who finds 'Symphony Fantastique' erotic.
10885	3	a	Whedon's direction is no letdown.
10886	9	a	Lawrence seems trapped in his jug-eared, slightly clownish nervousness, like a sidekick suddenly shoved into the spotlight.
10887	3	a	Vittorio De Sica's second film was the first major success of the neorealistic movement and the first film to win the Best Foreign Language Oscar.
10888	9	a	"Remove ""curious"" from the title and replace it with ""twee and pointless"", and you're close to it. What a incredible shaggy-puppy of a movie, a cobweb-construction patched together with CGI, prosthetics, gibberish and warm tears."
10889	3	a	If you're into high-brow humor, you ain't gonna find it in The Hot Chick.
10890	3	a	Effective translation of a theatre piece. Russell Crowe's best performance.
10891	4	a	Given the finished film, one also has to wonder if Ed Wood was interesting enough to base a two- hour movie on.
10892	3	a	Exuberantly crappy bad fun.
10893	6	a	Like The Blues Brothers, this film has a ridiculous conceit that doesn't quite work.
10894	3	a	Get On Up revels in the energy of James Brown, as played with intense concentration and excitement by Chadwick Boseman. 
10895	2	a	Hoffman and Linney are wonderful -- underplaying so perfectly that crumpled, bittersweet truths continue to surface.
10896	1	a	"First Reformed"" takes some wild, unexpected and uncomfortable turns in its final act that will surely shock some, anger others and disturb just about everyone. For Schrader, it shows that he's still got it. Welcome back."
10897	1	a	Be prepared for one of the best endings of any movie this decade
10898	5	a	More superhero sitcom than comic book adventure, the movie lacks a strong, dramatic through-line.
10899	3	a	Bearing all the Mann hallmarks, this is visually enthralling, relentlessly stylish crime drama. A little too languorous for its own good at times, but still vastly superior entertainment.
10900	3	a	This is a good filmthat could have been great if not for an act of well-intentioned, but misguided casting.
10901	3	a	This is a celebration of how magical the movies can still be.
10902	1	a	Crimson Peak definitely doesn't disappoint as a fun, scary piece of cinematic entertainment.
10903	4	a	An endearingly oddball indie sci-fi.
10904	7	a	The film offered Jolie her first opportunity to star in a comedic role, and it proves she should stick to drama.
10905	1	a	"What Travis has done is nothing short of create a new kind of American action film that feels European in the same way that William Friedkin's ""French Connection"" did."
10906	3	a	It's dark and a bit contrived, and that will turn off some, but audiences seeking something offbeat and scary won't be disappointed. 
10907	2	a	While the story does lightly touch on some of the questionable decisions of the Chicago Seven's leaders, it generates a compelling argument for free speech.
10908	1	a	An almost perfect savvy blend of horror and comedy that both honors the horror genre while standing it on its head.
10909	1	a	A deceptive combination of all sorts of tones that seems like a stylistic jumble while keeping up a restrained front and never resorting to easy hyperactivity.
10910	4	a	A strong finish does a lot to smooth out the rougher edges found in Paper Towns.
10911	9	a	There's something pernicious about a toxic mix of sitcom and snickering sex jokes getting packaged and effectively sold as wholesome fun for the family.
10912	3	a	Here's a thriller that worked for me.
10913	4	a	Eastwood's Robert Kincaid -- made out in the book to be some sort of quasi-mythical cross between the Marlboro Man and Ralph Waldo Emerson -- is toned down so much as to be almost uncompelling.
10914	5	a	None of it is very compelling, thanks in large part to Hong's painfully perfunctory camera style.
10915	2	a	Bleed For This is an inspirational knockout. Miles Teller is proving to be a supremely versatile actor.
10916	4	a	It's a sometimes entertaining movie, but thin.
10917	7	a	Was something lost in translation or was the source material not as strong as book sales would have us believe?
10918	3	a	When Billy ends his opening monologue saying that the film is for both gays and straights, he is not lying.
10919	5	a	After a promising premise, it soon disintegrates into a preposterous predator/prey tale filled with brutality, bloodshed and butchery.
10920	4	a	It's a crafty action flick with a pristine cast that works, ever so briefly, as a wish-fulfillment fantasy.
10921	3	a	The strength of the piece is that it realises which aspects of its genre have been seen too many times, always coming back to Nelson's blank but expressive stare as he watches terrible things the director doesn't need to shove in our faces.
10922	1	a	Chris' relationship with the machine of expectations and responsibilities is tried by Keener and Holbrook in particular, but he sticks to his guns and leaves a wake of bittersweet gaps behind him.
10923	3	a	A great experience for Titanic buffs.
10924	3	a	Japanimation lovers should definitely catch this jam.
10925	3	a	Entertaining biopic focuses on Hitch's marriage and method.
10926	9	a	A confused and confusing enterprise.
10927	9	a	"Our inability to identify with [Townshend] means we can't identify with the film's central horror, and thus ""Contracted"" isn't all that unsettling."
10928	4	a	The Good Girl is more marketable than Chuck and Buck. It is also more forgettable.
10929	3	a	A wild mess, but what a mess it is.
10930	4	a	The ludicrous relationship between these two spies almost destroys what little credibility the story has, but director Siegel keeps their screen time to a minimum and instead concentrates on propelling the narrative at top speed.
10931	2	a	Often bitterly funny.
10932	3	a	Writer-director David O. Russell's out-of-control filmmaking style is perfectly suited to a romantic-comedy involving mental illness, and he infuses the film with a sparky unpredictability that's echoed in the perfectly graded performances of the cast.
10933	6	a	A muted, hit-and-miss kid's film that offers just enough to keep children and parents invested, but not enough to fully engage anyone else.
10934	7	a	Utterly devoid of any real originality or charm, and so loaded down with clumsy effects it's an ordeal to sit through. Every step of the way, it feels like just what it is: a merchandising devise.
10935	6	a	While the script is, on the comedy front, the film's strongest suit, it's also its weakest, in terms of the simple fact that none of this makes any sense at all.
10936	5	a	The streetball scenes, much like the plot, have a few high points but never hit their stride.
10937	3	a	It won't change your life, but it will keep you happily entertained for a couple hours.
10938	9	a	What should be easily broken is a large china vase over the head of everyone involved in this profoundly creepy, yucky, and chillingly reactionary relationship drama.
10939	4	a	There isn't enough space to dig deeply into these stories but a classy and committed cast make it work.
10940	6	a	Misses its opportunity to be a smart, investigative crime drama ... a frivolous and shallow affair about partying teens.
10941	0	a	[This] film will mean a lot to a lot of people - not just anyone whose life Alzheimer's has affected, but anyone whom it could affect, ever.
10942	9	a	This is not 'The Predator' we were promised, nor is it one we ever needed in the franchise.
10943	6	a	The pretend moments call into question the legitimacy of the genuine ones, until it becomes impossible for Paper Heart to make its own point.
10944	3	a	Doug Liman, the director of Bourne, directs the traffic well, gets a nice wintry look from his locations, absorbs us with the movie's spycraft and uses Damon's ability to be focused and sincere.
10945	1	a	Y'all, this movie is one wild ride that must be taken. Everybody needs to see it. Unless you can only enjoy a movie in a completely silent theater... then you may want to try to catch an empty screening.
10946	10	a	This is the Texas chainsaw massacre, not the Texas chainsaw misunderstanding. Nothing castrates a bogeyman like cheap-Freud psychology, and Leatherface possesses no greater power than a hulking professional-wrestling heel. A low point in American horror.
10947	3	a	There's real inspiration to be found in this warmly told David and Goliath story, and 'tis a fine time to revel in that.
10948	5	a	Anthony Anderson shows he can star in a movie without a kangaroo in this kidnapping plan gone crazy.
10949	4	a	It all ends in tears, and much louder music, and a series of events that strain credibility to snapping point, although it could well be that by then you're sobbing too loudly to care.
10950	4	a	Directors Greg Tiernan and Conrad Vernon are working with a first-rate cast, running wild with stereotypes and daring you to be offended.
10951	4	a	OK, so American Dreamz tries a little too hard to be satirically witty and bitingly political. But, darn it, it still makes you laugh in spite of yourself.
10952	4	a	David O. Russell's comedy about private eyes looking into the unseen is unexpected, uneven and unpolished.
10953	1	a	It's not surprising that Oscar voters fell for the charms of this Italian odyssey, since it's essentially a love letter to Fellini and Rome.
10954	4	a	Redgrave's performance is touching, but generally this romcom is far too schmaltzy.
10955	4	a	Despite its melodramatic glimpses into the drivers' private lives, the racing sequences more than make up for the deficiencies.
10956	6	a	It might well get under the skin of a few Mums and - especially - Dads. But the nippers sitting next to them are more likely to be crying with boredom than ennui.
10957	5	a	Only in a movie like this could live-TV drunkenness become a career-advancing move.
10958	6	a	Every insightful storytelling choice is met with a head-scratching one.
10959	3	a	Director Fincher knows atmosphere, and atmosphere is what you get.
10960	4	a	The charm of the actors, the unabashedly romantic goofiness and the clever winks at classic Disney set pieces make the movie not only kid-friendly but a guilty pleasure for adults as well.
10961	4	a	Kudos to this first-time feature director for braiding his insider experience into something quite singular.
10962	4	a	The level of acting elevates The Closet.
10963	0	a	A stunning, enrapturing film, a crowning work by one of the American cinema's most essential artists.
10964	3	a	I'm not so removed from my teenage years that I've forgotten the struggles and the anxiety that comes along with being a teenager... The Edge of Seventeen gave me that exact same feeling.
10965	9	a	It's essentially Blazing Saddles, only the fart jokes aren't quite as fresh.
10966	6	a	When great premises go wrong, the result is movies like Man of the Year.
10967	4	a	Rare among anime films, Cowboy Bebop pays more attention to story than architecture.
10968	3	a	...A work of remarkable clarity and vision, as well as one of the most original pictures of this or any other year.
10969	6	a	Doom becomes tedious in a hurry.
10970	3	a	The Three Laws of Robotics still seem as fresh, compelling and provocative as ever. 
10971	9	a	It was bad enough when Martin Lawrence humiliated himself in such noxious comedy hits as Big Momma's House, National Security and Wild Hogs.
10972	3	a	It's a fine movie with a good message, which partially self-destructs by constantly trying to beat its message into our heads.
10973	5	a	"That these seemingly dim dudes with cartoonish Southern accents, a matter-of-fact grounding in the world of NASCAR, county fairs, John Denver and child beauty pageants are actually smarter than we assume isn't a ""gag"" but a key part of the story."
10974	2	a	This darker, slicker and more humane re-telling of Swedish crime thriller The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo improves upon previous adaptations, thanks to David Fincher's vast skills as a master of dark suspense. 
10975	4	a	Seinfeld has completely dumbed-down his normal clever wit in order to appeal to younger kids; they're probably the only ones who might enjoy this.
10976	5	a	"The movie's multitasking creator seems to have bitten off more then she can chew. Her friends should have advised ""baby steps."
10977	3	a	Bob Nelson's script is a mine of mordant humor and wry insight, and director Alexander Payne carefully brings out the best in the script and his actors.
10978	4	a	A complex revenge drama and an intriguing mystery that, like the old magic act standby, attempts to pull a rabbit or two out of its hat by the end.
10979	2	a	Its main appeal, however, still rests with the beautiful images and haunting battles; they'll stick with you long after the particulars of the plot have faded.
10980	5	a	More dreary than fun.
10981	3	a	A diverting drama about the bounties of wonder, beauty, and being present to the delights of the senses.
10982	6	a	Closer to straightforward drama than black comedy.
10983	4	a	Slow start, senstational ending: a decent job. No The Lord Of The Rings, but no The Phantom Menace either.
10984	4	a	Crimson Peak is a lot of fun for the most part, knowingly camp and nicely photographed, but the CGI effects become too dominant late on, as Mr del Toro lashes on the guignol.
10985	9	a	If you're a fan, there could be something here to keep you involved and maybe leave you satisfied. But for newcomers, it's an uphill battle to make sense of it all and just about impossible to care.
10986	3	a	A second helping would be hard to justify were it not for Depp, whose manic idea of comedy seems right for a Stephen King thriller.
10987	3	a	As a companion piece to Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone, Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets makes for effective viewing.
10988	4	a	As a cinema experience, Project Nim was never likely to reach the heights of Marsh's Man on Wire, but the eccentricities of his story made it well worth telling.
10989	3	a	The movie is consistently funny without ever going over the top -- a rarity in movies.
10990	4	a	...Spielberg has a genius for ... audience adulation
10991	5	a	There is some unexpectedly subversive fun to be had at the expense of the world's major religions, but the pace is slow and the point laboured.
10992	5	a	Intermittently diverting as it may be, the movie bears all the earmarks of a cobbled-together, made-by-committee product, poorly aimed at its tween-and-younger target audience in look, tone, music and story.
10993	0	a	There may be some people who can watch Kermit the Frog's nephew Robin give his heart-wrenching performance as Tiny Tim in The Muppet Christmas Carol without choking up. I am not among them.
10994	0	a	One of the best animated films ever made for families: it celebrates feminine sensitivity, the importance of the spirit world, respect for nature, and the pre-eminence of the spiritual practice of kindness.
10995	4	a	At least one draft short of brilliance....[but] more palatable than the typical romantic comedy, thanks in large part to Vaughn's engaging duets with the ensemble.
10996	4	a	Seinfeld's sardonic wit is as sharp and irresistible as ever...
10997	2	a	Astro Boy is a marvelously designed piece of cartoon kinetics, with the pleasing soft colors and rounded-metal tactility of an atomic-age daydream.
10998	3	a	I, Frankenstein isn't a masterpiece, but it is a fast-paced and slickly made film that holds your attention.
10999	7	a	This film was made to get laughs from the slowest person in the audience -- just pure slapstick with lots of inane, inoffensive screaming and exaggerated facial expressions.
11000	5	a	It looks like most of the money spent in this project went to explosions, which are many and huge, and to acting salaries, at the expense of special effects and the script, which could have used a big upgrade.
11001	6	a	End result: You can't believe any of it. And poor Haley Joel Osment. Now he sees dead movies. 
11002	3	a	I'm saying it could have been more worthwhile and aware than it is. As for the film, it has two strong performances and enough grace notes to make that a solid yes, you should see this.
11003	3	a	Having one of the world's finest actors in a near-perfect role for him goes a long way to create a character and plot-driven film that pays the greatest homage to the author's work.
11004	4	a	full review in Greek
11005	4	a	...watchable yet far-from-engrossing...
11006	3	a	While [the film] gets more emotional and resonant as it goes on, it also gets much slower and narrower in scope.
11007	4	a	How can we make an entire motion picture based solely on a woman's rear end?
11008	3	a	"Earnest, square and proudly evangelical, ""Black Nativity"" is so unusual that its rough aspects are easy to forgive."
11009	3	a	Call Me by Your Name is a fairly straightforward coming-of-age story that's at its finest in moments when the relationships take on larger meanings than their literal context implies, and Luca Guadagnino finds evocative aesthetic expressions for them. 
11010	1	a	Selma manages to beautifully articulate a pivotal moment in history - one that is hauntingly ironic in how it echoes our current times and society.
11011	3	a	Tart and sweet, unmistakably funny and exceptionally well observed.
11012	2	a	The key stroke to the success of Moretti's film is that the thematic push-and-pull rides under the surface of what is a very often funny film. The laughs are frequent, but never mean.
11013	4	a	Entertaining enough with visuals to die for, but definitely not as emotionally rewarding as some of this director's other recent pictures.
11014	3	a	McGuigan manages to tell a truly touching story without resorting to any superfluous narrative devices. His generosity toward his actors is second to none, giving them just enough melodrama to work with without ever overdoing it. 
11015	4	a	...half a Sturges is better than no Sturges at all.
11016	3	a	engineered in every moment to keep you throttled on the edge of your seat, tense with acrophobic queasiness
11017	2	a	unusually for a biopic, it is Petey's failure to change, from beginning to end, that forms an essential part of his lionisation.
11018	10	a	Tries hard to be hot and steamy but ends up being lifeless and laughable.
11019	2	a	Although well-crafted and performed, The Imitation Game proves to be much to conventional a film about an unconventional, remarkable and tragic life.
11020	3	a	Videocracy is a fascinating film, indicative of the new wave of scorn and revulsion felt by a younger generation of Italians for Berlusconi's smug and mediocre rule.
11021	1	a	If you thought Hero was stunning to behold, House of Flying Daggers is even better.
11022	6	a	Content to be a kind of Valentine to the slain rapper -- so reliant on recycled MTV footage that it feels more like a Behind the Music special than a feature film.
11023	4	a	clearly an exercise for his extended filmmaking family to have fun and they mostly let us in on it
11024	8	a	"American Pastoral"" is ambitious but it's also a mess, a colossal one at times."
11025	7	a	There's not enough oxygen in any room for these two giant egos to share... ...they're about as cuddly together as alien intelligences from different galaxies making first contact.
11026	0	a	Nebraska is the work of a great director hitting his stride.
11027	6	a	Despite a superb cast, Crossover dribbles slowly, with not nearly enough time on the basketball court.
11028	6	a	Chadwick Boseman disappears into his character in a great performance but the film is ill-served by a confusing non-linear design.
11029	9	a	Just because he's the end product of a mad scientist experiment, built with the remains of dead bodies, doesn't mean he can skimp on the abdominal crunches.
11030	3	a	Director Jane Campion has a knack for portraying female characters so intimately that she seems to get beneath their skin. She does it again in Bright Star, an exquisite piece of film-making.
11031	6	a	"Despite excellent performances by Kevin Costner, Octavia Spencer and other cast members, Mike Binder's racially tinged custody battle drama ""Black or White"" never achieves much in the way of dramatic credibility."
11032	6	a	Solid and acceptable instead of soaring and exceptional, [and] unnecessarily hampered in its quest to reach the magical heights of the trilogy.
11033	4	a	...Devil's Due, does its best to inject some freshness into a scenario that seems to blanket movie screens week in, week out. Sadly, it comes up hard against the limitations of both the format and the genre, and can't ever overcome them.
11034	6	a	In The Sandlot's nostalgia for simpler times, a single-sex world seems to be a key component.
11035	3	a	It's fun in a 'What were they smoking?' kind of way.
11036	6	a	Basically the film is an excuse to show off the period's silk tapestry and costumes, and a number of colorful and well choreographed battles.
11037	6	a	This 'comedy' is so clumsily executed and wheezy it's a wonder anyone had the resolve to finish it.
11038	8	a	Derivative, predictable and dull despite much hectic action, it ends with the foreshadowing of a sequel you know will never come, the very definition of a hoped-for series that arrives pre-embalmed.
11039	3	a	funny
11040	0	a	Don't let it be forgot, that once there was a crash which in one brief, shameful moment brought down the curtain on a dynasty known as Camelot.
11041	8	a	For all its ADD editing, it's a joyless slog.
11042	2	a	Compston, in his first role, is riveting because of the sense of authenticity and hopelessness he brings to the part.
11043	7	a	Lacks humor and bite.
11044	3	a	As far as coming-of-age stories go, The Edge of Seventeen's refreshing mix of authenticity and quirkiness will charm teenagers of all ages.
11045	6	a	"As a showcase for Tucci's comic skills, ""The Alarmist"" succeeds. We start the film feeling buoyed by his roosterlike energy and audacity, and we end it feeling let down by a script that can't quite decide what it wants to say."
11046	4	a	Novelty alone can't keep Love Ranch's tiresome tropes and plodding storyline from dragging the film down through the Nevada dust.
11047	4	a	Sure this is going to draw some comparisons to Bridesmaids - and understandably so - but still there are some great performances and touching moments.
11048	3	a	A winningly fresh take on a tale that has never gone out of style...Disney has done Stevenson proud.
11049	2	a	This a touching film that depicts the father/son relationship in a manner that feels as authentic as its setting. 
11050	3	a	Difret is an important film dealing with an important theme ... Don't be deterred by the gravitas.
11051	5	a	It was if the cinema had been turned into a laugh-free zone.
11052	3	a	Surely there is room in the movies for a small film with an unabashed, even old-fashioned but timeless humanist spirit - and a triumphant portrayal by a veteran star that is likely to be regarded as one of the year's best.
11053	0	a	Bond really is back.
11054	5	a	Scuba-diving thriller with drugs, treasure and bikini-clad flesh isn't especially deep or gripping, even with eye candy aplenty.
11055	6	a	The film is a fairly faithful transcription of events, even though Liz, as played by Roberts, carries a faint air of entitlement. I'm not sure this could be avoided on screen.
11056	9	a	There are a few exciting battle sequences and the sets are lavish, but mostly the film meanders aimlessly for more than two hours. No wonder new sword-and-sandal movies are in short supply.
11057	3	a	Hazanavicius has woven together a variety of cinematic styles from different eras to make a silent film that is easily accessible to a contemporary audience.
11058	5	a	[We] have SoaP to remind us of what a B movie can be when it's produced with utter contempt for its target audience.
11059	5	a	A movie from Mars
11060	3	a	This is a film for people who want something more than predictable entertainment. It's for people who love to watch people.
11061	6	a	The movie is curiously listless, with all of its passion apparently expended on its technical feats.
11062	3	a	Hawke offers one of his best performances, a masterful blending of outward stoicism and strong and challenging emotions.
11063	5	a	The film is simply too brief, too befuddled and too delirious to do the comic book legend justice.
11064	5	a	It certainly gives the nippers their slapstick fix. Sadly, the only sense of wonder it will stir in their parents is when it will all end.
11065	4	a	It's compelling, but leaves you eventually disturbed.
11066	4	a	I got my first date because of this movie so you won't see me giving it any less than three stars.
11067	4	a	Delivers its commendable message with affecting eloquence.
11068	3	a	Funny string-driven action satire.
11069	2	a	Standard inspirational sports movie given added weight by Mandela's wisdom and his political courage, and the historical significance of his presidency.
11070	3	a	Nosferatu is the seminal moment for horror cinema.
11071	0	a	while belly laughing and scratching your head at the same time, Huckabees will wash over you in the sweetest way, leaving you wholly satisfied with the outcome. 
11072	0	a	As Bourne seeks to uncover his past and bury those who would cross him, director Paul Greengrass masterfully blends sight, sound and silence to do much more than entertain: This film leaves a deep psychological imprint.
11073	5	a	A maudlin, disorganized family movie, throwing out so many platitudes and quasi-themes that I soon stopped trying to keep track and turned against it.
11074	6	a	[Sayles] concentrates on the six tiresome Americans ... at the expense of their Latin hosts who, to a one, are much much more interesting and worthy of our time.
11075	6	a	"Like its main character, ""I Don't Know How She Does It"" tries to do everything, but it doesn't quite succeed."
11076	4	a	Ultimately it's a refreshing, amusing, and surprisingly touching comedy.
11077	10	a	The understatement of the year. Essentially, ax-wielding rednecks unite in a slasher flick that drives itself into a brick wall of no return.
11078	9	a	I'm not sure Zombie really wants to scare us at all. Turn our stomachs; maybe, scratch our heads, sure. But scares are not really on the Zombie menu.
11079	3	a	Early Polanski is a treat.
11080	4	a	Perhaps there's no better time for a reminder of the power of non-violent protest, but Selma also provides a potentially dangerous reassurance that the battle has already been won.
11081	6	a	In essence Chicago comes closer to capturing that life of artists and performance; Memoirs is just whoring for a little prestige known as the Oscars.
11082	3	a	The most improbable of movies, a comic thriller set in the Bahamas in which Walker and Alba bare enough flesh to seduce us into thinking they've bared pieces of their souls.
11083	4	a	In a sense, the film is a lament for old certainties which are cruelly swept aside, perhaps purged would be more accurate, by Bardem's extraordinary monster.
11084	6	a	Sienna Miller lights up an otherwise mediocre recounting of the rise and fall of Andy Warhol muse Edie Sedgwick.
11085	10	a	Surely the rocker, an incredible admirer of horror films, realized his final product wasn't above the standards of the kind of straight-to-video shlock that even Elvira or Sybil Danning would be ashamed to present.
11086	4	a	Though the story is confusing and derivative, Final Fantasy: The Spirits Within is as visually startling as any fan could have hoped.
11087	2	a	Works as both a rare introduction to a way of life largely unseen as well as a touching depiction of fighting for what's most important in life.
11088	3	a	Cage and Rockwell play off each other with devilish finesse.
11089	0	a	The Coen brothers have once again placed themselves at the very forefront of American cinema.
11090	3	a	A sloppy, miscast, hammed up, overlong, overloud story that still sends you out of the theater on a cloud of rapture.
11091	0	a	Brilliant from first frame to last, this faithful adaptation of McCarthy's novel is the Coen brothers best film to date, a masterpiece that's mesmerizing as a thriller and meditation on the nature of violence in America.
11092	6	a	The movie seems to lack a solid point of view; it basically offers a series of vignettes without any unifying theme or common thread - except that these adrenaline junkies in a foreign land drink and screw around a lot. ...
11093	6	a	It's an old-fashioned Bond movie--or at least promises the next one will be--and that's good news for many.
11094	6	a	I could see this film being more powerful when viewed during the war.
11095	0	a	Don't miss a chance to see and hear it on the big screen.
11096	4	a	Enchanting for most of its running time.
11097	6	a	Family angst and reconciliation... bleargh.
11098	5	a	There's not a single laugh-out-loud moment in the whole film.
11099	6	a	It is an extravagant exercise in bad taste and camp. While it tries to intentionally funny, some of the humour merely falls flat on its face.
11100	1	a	The picture is not the best of Hitchcock's body of work, but it is quite a well done film and well worth looking for.
11101	1	a	... possibly the perfect chick flick/buddy flick hybrid... light enough, clever enough, and well-rounded enough to earn and entertain its target audience.
11102	9	a	It's frustrating, not to mention insulting.
11103	4	a	This biopic coulda been a contender if superior specimens like Rocky and Raging Bull hadn't landed their punches first.
11104	4	a	Theron, who looks throughout like Gary Busey under a blonde wig, is truly staggering, and not just because of her jaw-dropping physical transformation.
11105	3	a	The music, lovingly performed by such paragons as Alison Kraus, Emmylou Harris, Taj Mahal and Iris Dement, takes on the importance of a character in the movie.
11106	1	a	Tanovic's film is coil-sprung to explode on the unsuspecting.
11107	0	a	"Corbijn gives ""A Most Wanted Man"" the momentum of a thriller but Hoffman's subtle performance gives it the depth of a melancholy character portrait."
11108	6	a	It's all as dumb as mud, but it's familiar and comfortable enough to entertain on a basic level.
11109	9	a	In this formulaic, claustrophobic shoot'em-up, based on a video game, soldiers quell a mutant uprising on Mars.
11110	5	a	The incoherent, over-complicated storyline is played with much too much gravity, and the few jokes aren't funny.
11111	5	a	This movie is so damn predictable.
11112	0	a	There may not be the normal, anticipated dosage of sentiment to latch onto in this film, but in exchange for patience and a little faith, Button presents the exquisite weight of the human experience in a manner the screen rarely witnesses.
11113	8	a	Despite the presence of a cathedral among the settings and a couple of priests in the cast, this hapless disaster doesn't have a prayer of getting past a first installment.
11114	5	a	Like strangers who have been set up on a blind date, Grant and Bullock squirm their way through the exasperatingly inept Two Weeks Notice.
11115	0	a	The most-discussed work of the master; despairingly sardonic and demanding of multiple viewings.
11116	2	a	Curtis Hall keeps slipping in surprising social and emotional flavorings rarely found in [this] genre.
11117	6	a	Even as it zeros in on radical shifts in the mechanics and mores of parenthood, it sits quite comfortably in a well-worn romantic-comedy groove.
11118	1	a	If you thought Tom Hanks was just an ordinary big-screen star, wait until you've seen him eight stories tall.
11119	1	a	What propels this grisly chapter is the characters' keen sense of agency.
11120	3	a	Simply, if you're a fan of the way Jackson has delivered Middle-earth to you in the past, then this is more of the same...
11121	1	a	It's a morality play, really, but dripping with humid sex and violence.
11122	3	a	A touching, honest and funny film, showing how miserable growing up can be and how, often, the only way of dealing with it is to shrug your shoulders, flip it the middle finger and walk off laughing.
11123	0	a	In addition to being riotously funny, The Incredibles is also extremely exciting.
11124	6	a	The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey is a story stretched too thin; dragged out by drudging slowness and obvious padding that its handful of thrilling action sequences can't improve. 
11125	0	a	Chickens are inherently funny, like nature's idea of a very practical joke. Park and Lord have just improved the old rubber chicken gag, making it movable, turning it into something closer to who we are and what we know as humans.
11126	7	a	The melancholy in this film is just as trumped up as the frenzy.
11127	9	a	Sometimes, even a little gratuitous nudity can't save a movie. This is one of those occasions.
11128	4	a	Even though some of the jokes are starting to wear a little thin, it's testament to the enduring popularity of the series' central trio that this third installment ticks so many boxes without bringing anything new to the table.
11129	5	a	Stallone's boasted that he's made the drunk uncle of all dumb action movies and in several ways he has
11130	3	a	Great boy-and-dog tale, but be prepared for tears.
11131	3	a	Twisty, disturbing mix of John Hughes and James Cameron is an unsettling meditation on fate -- and the debut of a major talent.
11132	6	a	It's pretty clear by now that characters in sci-fi movies have never seen a sci-fi movie.
11133	2	a	Werner and Signoret were wonderful, and deserved their nominations.
11134	5	a	Despite fleeting moments of entertainment, The Angry Birds Movie comes across as a hollow viewing experience that doesn't have much to offer - even for kids.
11135	9	a	Kids deserve both more, and less.
11136	6	a	...for the faithful. For everyone else, it will probably prove the same as any long journey, periods of discovery and excitement countered with long stretches of boredom.
11137	5	a	Writer/director Ben Younger blows a chance to make a powerful real-life Rocky movie. This one is an epic fail at almost every level. The worst boxing sequences of all time. 
11138	1	a	Jackson's best performance in more than a decade
11139	7	a	Lays on the eccentricity too thick and winds up seeming incredibly affected.
11140	2	a	Astro Boy stands on its own as a nifty piece of animated fun, full of good lessons, brisk pacing and humour and sweetness the original anime sometimes lacked. It does Osamu Tezuka's source creation proud.
11141	3	a	While watching Cage in Bad Lieutenant I felt like a crack fiend myself: No matter how much I got it was never going to be enough.
11142	4	a	If calculated catharsis does not annoy you, then The Light Between Oceans could be the late summer movie for you.
11143	6	a	Unsure of whether to deliver scares or laughs, this aerial action-adventure winds up failing to consistently offer either, straining mightily, and ultimately futilely, to be all things to all people.
11144	6	a	Despite some solid moves against viewer expectations, Doom ultimately embraces the cliched doom of all video game movies.
11145	3	a	Serviceably dramatizes an important historical story while giving rising star Cumberbatch suitably juicy material.
11146	2	a	Final? Really? How can something with final in the title have a five after the word?
11147	7	a	A workmanlike but hardly scintillating mystery that spends more time and energy reintroducing characters from the show and trying to capture its original flavor than constructing a compelling narrative.
11148	1	a	Knocked Up has a really surprising sweetness to it amidst some truly raunchy jokes.
11149	3	a	...the ultimate nostalgia movie of all time ...
11150	4	a	Cooper manages to show that he is still capable of doing more than his traditional throw-away, comedic roles.
11151	9	a	Alvin and the Chipmunks: The Road Chip is the fourth, agonising instalment in the franchise that charts the adventures of three enormously-punchable helium-voiced rodents.
11152	6	a	Whenever Jolie entered a room, I found my attention wandering to the European extras, whose heads keep turning to watch her. They seemed far more enchanted by her than I was. Maybe you had to be there.
11153	4	a	when you finally get to the end of the film, it works in the context of the series and definitely tops the previous installment
11154	4	a	Given a real character to play, and one within her range, Ryan delivers a real performance, and a really likable one, in this sassy-but-not-edgy boxing picture.
11155	5	a	In lieu of a flurry of left hooks and roundhouse kicks, we stay safely in Stallone's comfort zone of shoot 'em ups and s--- getting blown up.
11156	5	a	A morbidly insensitive insult.
11157	9	a	A pocket of infection on the skin of the American body cultural.
11158	6	a	Reeves has charm to spare with the kids and Lane but fails to convince in his drinking, gambling scenes.
11159	3	a	All in all, this is a smart, charming and endearing film.
11160	4	a	Witherspoon, whose movie characters often exhibit a whim of iron even though they have a Barbie twinkle, is well cast.
11161	1	a	Silver Linings Playbook is, like its protagonist, hopelessly optimistic ... and it's a sign of the film's potency that we buy into it with our own sense of hopefulness.
11162	3	a	Hitchcock's playful yet slightly dark tone makes it an easy film to watch and the insight into Hitch the man will be a hoot for any fan of his work.
11163	1	a	A terrific return to form on a par with Fargo and other Coen classics.
11164	9	a	You won't understand what's going on and, even worse, you won't care.
11165	4	a	Some of the episodic tales work better than others, but all are interesting and there are splendid characterisations from both young and more senior members of the cast.
11166	7	a	It's terminally bland, the script lacking any sense of surprise or suggestion of edginess; adults will find it utterly predictable, but even tykes are likely to react to the 'follow your dream' message with a ho-hum attitude. 
11167	2	a	Spearheaded by enormously charismatic actors and a script's verbal wit that overrides its untidiness.
11168	4	a	Team America is uproariously funny when it's not completely disgusting.
11169	2	a	Annette Bening delivers a powerhouse performance, as does Jamie Bell. It's subtly poignant, another Tinseltown tragedy.
11170	2	a	A pretty darn-good movie.
11171	3	a	Appealing family comedy with old-fashioned feel.
11172	5	a	"For all of the massive sets and overstated rumination on the design of the universe, ""Agora"" is film that fails at every step to be believable."
11173	2	a	There's enough of a strong filmmaking backbeat in Bandslam to carry the movie's light tune.
11174	6	a	Director Derek Cianfrance attempts to bring the emotional rawness of his previous films and influences to the melodrama genre with The Light Between Oceans, but he never quite pulls off the feat.
11175	9	a	The problem is not one of factual accuracy; it is one of dramatic credibility, stymied all the way through by the remorseless sanctification of its subject.
11176	6	a	The real trouble with this movie is that it represents the continuing departure of Almodovar from the chaotic, riotous and anti-social roots that gave his best movies their zest.
11177	2	a	Funny but not end-of-the-world funny.
11178	1	a	For a film about early onset Alzheimer's, this is a remarkably wry, honest and even hopeful drama, anchored by another staggeringly sensitive performance by Julianne Moore.
11179	5	a	It follows all the rules of comedic plot convention, with only an occasional ripple of surprise.
11180	5	a	A tired thriller guaranteed to get lost amidst the cerebral and artsy offerings of the holidays
11181	1	a	By the end of the movie, I don't know that I liked Chris, but I understood him and sympathized with him, and sometimes that's more important.
11182	4	a	Christopher Robin relies heavily on the charm of Pooh and his companions, including Peter Capaldi as Rabbit, who are convincingly brought to life through digital trickery.
11183	0	a	Fiction and reality blur powerfully into a dizzying treatise on not just a broken cowboy, but also America. 
11184	1	a	A clever adaptation.
11185	4	a	There are exhilarating moments, and there are some undeniably tense scenes. Mixed in, however, is possibly more trudging than you're going to see in any other film.
11186	4	a	The film is a button-pusher, but it is so in the nicest way possible.
11187	6	a	It is good for magic to be, in effect, confounding. It is not so good for a movie about magic to be confusing.
11188	3	a	The grand tradition of city symphonies, films tailored to celebrate the mood and feeling of their urban settings, lives on here.
11189	3	a	Parents should be warned that about two-thirds in, it becomes less funny and instead gets pretty dark.
11190	6	a	No one seems to want to talk about [race], so Binder finds ways to force them to. Every time, those methods feel forced and unearned.
11191	4	a	The story canters along at a merry pace and doesn't outstay its welcome.
11192	3	a	'Middle Men' may not have the action and slapstick comedy that one expects to see this late in the summer, but the film is filled with zest and actually worth exploring.
11193	3	a	An Unexpected Journey is a competent, entertaining effort but it neither enthralls nor amazes in the way its predecessors did.
11194	3	a	When the movie was over, I stepped out into the daylight and felt a weird sensation. It was a form of relief. The suspense had gotten to me more deeply than I expected.
11195	4	a	If this pairing sounds like movie magic to you, we're sure you'll love the picture.
11196	8	a	Everyone involved should go straight to detention, and stay there to think about what they've done.
11197	2	a	Most of the film is zippy, funny, and fascinatingly strange -- all qualities that are often lacking in some of the more bloated action blockbusters.
11198	2	a	Men in drag are usually played for laughs. Women passing as men? Expect a tragic twist.
11199	6	a	It's hard to believe that this drivel was based on a book... but Matthew McConaughey and Kate Hudson make it somewhat tolerable at least.
11200	4	a	Merely cute when it could be affecting, pleasant when it could be relevant.
11201	3	a	Boseman is absolutely electric as James Brown.
11202	4	a	One of the best Bonds, usually underrated because of Lazenby's performance and constant comparison to Sean Connery. But it has withstood the test of time.
11203	5	a	...it isn't that well-written and if you're accustomed to the genre it might even seem predictable.
11204	2	a	Coach Carter is like the coach's players themselves: there's more to the film than first meets the eye...
11205	5	a	Has impressive designs and a handful of humorous moments, but it's generic storytelling and slow pacing has it be just another average animated film aimed at young audiences.
11206	0	a	"If no one paid attention to Russell Crowe after his stellar performances in ""The Insider"" and ""L.A. Confidential,"" they did so after he put on his Roman togs."
11207	5	a	Overly concerned with making a film about the fans for the fans, but they forgot to ask, is it any good?
11208	3	a	Those expecting THE HOBBIT to be on the same level as LORD OF THE RINGS are only setting themselves up for disappointment. But if you just go in expecting a fun adventure, you should be able to enjoy it. Just DON'T see it in the higher frame rate.
11209	0	a	"It always threatens to spin out of control, but McDonagh secures a buzzing atmosphere of threat to the effort, allowing ""Three Billboards"" to blossom in unexpected ways"
11210	1	a	Nolan's supreme confidence, narrative skill, and taste for complexity make for unusually rich popular entertainment. Where was The Prestige this summer when we needed it most?
11211	3	a	The actors shift gears effortlessly, playing their parts with seriousness when the situation calls for it, but also enjoying those moments that are intended to be fun.
11212	3	a	It's good. Not brilliant, not a future Oscar contender, but a perfectly sturdy, sweet, pleasingly non-formulaic production that should amuse a variety of age groups.
11213	3	a	Wacky, wild and just as loony as Thomas Pynchon's novel it's based on.
11214	0	a	A kind of film that is extrememly rare: a philospophical motion picture.
11215	5	a	An opportunity badly blown.
11216	5	a	It's kind of incredible how little happens in this movie.
11217	3	a	Hoffman leaves us with a quality film that showcases his tremendous depth and range as an actor.
11218	0	a	Intensely dramatic and visually riveting, this highlight of Japanese cinema contrasts modernism and rural traditionalism through the struggle of one man who's at one with nature. 
11219	5	a	Billionaire Boys Club would fail even if Kevin Spacey's career hadn't crashed.
11220	7	a	A tedious slasher picture with yet another Inbred Monster as its star villain.
11221	3	a	Wry, supple, endearing.
11222	6	a	The makers of an anti-anxiety drug mentioned in Flightplan will probably rethink their involvement once they see the film.
11223	4	a	Hyper-earnest and less than half good, Mao's Last Dancer puts a biopic gloss on a bumpy journey.
11224	0	a	"Filmed with a master's eye, ""Hereafter"" continues the streak of outstanding films directed by Clint Eastwood. "
11225	4	a	It's just a shame the script doesn't push the humour further; brief, amusing put-downs aren't quite enough to make this a bonafide comedy. But if you're looking for a well-performed drama about dementia, you've got it.
11226	4	a	Let's just get it out of the way right now: Reader, I liked it.
11227	5	a	An unexpected sense of existential dread hangs over much of the confusing action. 
11228	1	a	Young and old, jocks and nerds, geeks and freaks, and everyone in between should be able to find something to adore in Love, Simon.
11229	1	a	One of the most cinematically assured works of the year. Blows most tried-and-true westerns out of the water.
11230	0	a	An extraordinary and visionary study of a legendary murderer's famous fate, within touching distance of Oscars.
11231	4	a	It's surprisingly okay, in a January kind of way.
11232	3	a	There is something easily and unassumingly good-natured about Early Man, an indication of what a very intelligent film-maker Park is.
11233	3	a	"What Dreams May Come""/Bond Junior"
11234	1	a	This isn't just another notch on the Coen brothers' amazing career of exquisitely crafted crime dramas. It's an instant American classic, and the first truly must-see awards contender of the year.
11235	3	a	Mind-bending psychodrama.
11236	1	a	This cracked social mirror the director holds up to society is no pretty sight. Although it's impossible to turn away.
11237	5	a	There's nothing in this lame, low budget stoner flick that even peeps above the parapet of the ordinary.
11238	4	a	You'll be happier with the film if you don't expect fidelity to source material, but that doesn't mean you'll hate it if you loved Niels Arden Oplev's movie.
11239	2	a	A celebration of just how unbelievably awesome it is to make rock music for a living - not to mention being so successful at it that you can get your childhood heroes to come over and jam.
11240	9	a	Writer/director Maggie Carey's clodhopping coming-of-age yarn merely proves that terrible teen movies are now a source of equal-ops embarrassment for both genders.
11241	6	a	The Rover does have a central nervous system that crackles and pops with suspense, but in the end it's not enough to jump-start the lack of narrative.
11242	8	a	Plays directly to MacFarlane's fascination with poo-poo, pee-pee humor, without ever moving beyond the basics of sophomoric gags to transform into the raging farce it sporadically hints at becoming. 
11243	3	a	...an ensemble acting piece with strong, simple themes painted as a continually changing mural. 
11244	1	a	Just about everybody in the cast of David O. Russell's strange and disturbing and deeply romantic new film has the chance to act with a capital A.
11245	4	a	An undeniably stirring, if predictable, account of how Nelson Mandela turned the Springbok team into a unifying force for his country. Non-rugby fans may find their patience tested, but Freeman's magisterial performance carries it.
11246	5	a	Another one of those movies where a demented fiend devotes an extraordinary amount of energy to setting up scenes for the camera.
11247	4	a	Thanks to McConaughey's oily power and Friedkin's unflinching purpose it's a compelling beast.
11248	4	a	Mao's Last Dancer is such a profoundly moving story, it's hard not to get drawn in as Li must decide how much he's willing to sacrifice for his American dream.
11249	3	a	Lush historical drama is engrossing but mature.
11250	2	a	My main concern upon hearing of this project was: will I believe that Matt Damon could kill me with a business card at fifty yards? Fortunately the answer is a resounding yes.
11251	7	a	I mean, if you were writing a script for a movie starring yourself, wouldn't you also write yourself a bunch of sex scenes too?
11252	0	a	The film, I am convinced, is unforgettable.
11253	5	a	The movie isn't worth the scuffed cowgirl boots it's scooting around in.
11254	3	a	A film that whispers its message, which is nice sometimes.
11255	1	a	This stuff works so well because the production is so convincing.
11256	5	a	Graphic scenes of self-harm in dark coming-of-age tale. 
11257	9	a	The new Texas Chainsaw Massacre movie is so desperate to create some indelible horror imagery that it forgets everything else that's required of a standard big screen movie macabre.
11258	5	a	I feel qualified to report that the game itself is more exciting and, just as important, much cheaper to sample.
11259	3	a	This delightful confection of short vignettes centered around java and smoking offers a whimsical glimpse of American envy, addiction, humor and pop culture.
11260	1	a	Every seemingly insignificant, color-coded fragment of the picture's makeup coheres into a satisfying whole.
11261	3	a	Ang Lee's Taking Woodstock is a coming-of-age comedy that roams the backstage and the back-story and sees that epic concert through rose-colored glasses.
11262	4	a	Any anti-materialistic movie from Hollywood - spiritual home of furtive product placement and dodgy role-models - deserves commendation for at least pretending to have its heart in the right place.
11263	6	a	It's practically the definition of a video throwaway, but you could do worse.
11264	3	a	In terms of sheer spectacle alone, War of the Worlds is a winner. If this movie doesn't help stop or turn around the box-office slide of the past few months, then Hollywood really is in big trouble.
11265	4	a	Maybe if the movie employed a bit more subtlety on all fronts, it'd be a far more successful outing. But subtlety seems like it was one of Sausage Party's chief adversaries from the ground shelf up.
11266	3	a	Bryan Singer has capably crafted this war thriller in such a way that one occasionally forgets the foregone conclusion and becomes wrapped up in the excitement of the moment.
11267	4	a	"Mirren's ""I am woman, hear me roar"" nuclear weapon-level unloading on her hubby is a contender for the strongest acting moment this year - time stops, jaws drop when she unleashes it."
11268	9	a	Stay far away from the three hour-plus Gods and Generals--unless, of course, you need a good nap.
11269	6	a	The fun and merriment take a backseat to the sci-fi elements, which are probably not what the intended audience is looking for.
11270	4	a	Some fascinating behind-the-scenes footage and some astonishing performances.
11271	6	a	The film's mangled chronology and melodrama ring flat alongside Ray, Walk the Line and the classic Patsy Cline biopic, Sweet Dreams.
11272	4	a	...it is a mess, but it's actually very engrossing. There's not a minute of the film that isn't watchable...
11273	3	a	The bonus in this modest charmer? Not a single major female character, including Will's single mother played by Lisa Kudrow, is subjected to the usual Hollywood rom-com demonization.
11274	4	a	Stay is interesting, but it's hard to recommend to anyone but the small cadre of David Lynch devotees who will inhale anything with a whiff of similarity to their favorite auteur's scent.
11275	9	a	It's really just about a bunch of pathetic losers whiling away the hours with their hands jammed down their pants.
11276	5	a	For a film about Warhol's infamous Factory scene, this Edie Sedgwick biopic is, in some ways, depressingly conventional.
11277	4	a	Ricci has guts. Nonetheless, Black Snake Moan turned my stomach.
11278	3	a	A small, smart indie pic with a twisted sensibility.
11279	5	a	The film pretends Tom and Julia are just two regular, down-to-earth, middle-aged people - even though their faces couldn't be any tighter if they pulled washing-up gloves over their heads.
11280	1	a	Nim is as unforgettable as the treatment of him is unspeakable.
11281	3	a	Not Easily Broken isn't perfect. It's a tad preachy at times. Yet it also lifts spirits with the power of emotional healing and forgiveness. Amen to that.
11282	6	a	'I'm the pre-teen Maggie Smith,' says Dakota Fanning, 'if Maggie Smith had a stripper name.' 
11283	1	a	This is the first amnesia movie in which we root for the hero not to get his memory back.
11284	6	a	Hackman wins in a landslide in the otherwise mediocre Mooseport
11285	1	a	The performances are exquisite.
11286	3	a	Sorry fellow critics but you are WAY off on this one. American Pastoral gets it right and becomes one of the best Phillip Roth adaptations ever.
11287	4	a	Jackie Chan's western action-comedy should offer you a fairly good time.
11288	4	a	Once again, Sedgwick is being remembered less for who she was than who she knew.
11289	7	a	The two leads rise above their script to develop something touching and lovely, something that mines the earth between starstruck and true love.
11290	4	a	It's clever, well-written and well acted. But not quite what I expected from a Trainspotting sequel.
11291	0	a	Hitchcock's most disturbing masterpiece.
11292	4	a	Once you get to the fiends and fights that make a comic book movie really work, things go stale.
11293	7	a	The characters are such cardboard cutouts and the plot so thin, you'll wish the Monty Python gang could come and wreak havoc on the film.
11294	4	a	One of those grand ol' classics you just have to see
11295	3	a	The Veronica Mars movie isn't the groundbreaker or the life-changer that you may have hoped, but like the show it's highly enjoyable, and probably more of a cult favorite than a blockbuster. 
11296	3	a	Morgan Freeman and Chris Rock turn out to be the most appealingly mismatched hitmen to hit the big screen since John Travolta and Samuel L. Jackson in Pulp Fiction.
11297	2	a	Funny, well-acted and surprisingly engaging.
11298	4	a	If nothing else, Brewer has come up with the perfect solution for dealing with the dozens of out-of-control teen actresses in the world.
11299	5	a	Anyone who has spent their teenage years cruising up and down Main Street will connect with the film... which is part of the reason I didn't.
11300	0	a	Imaginitive set pieces and a quick pace make this a wonderful debut for the series.
11301	3	a	It Comes At Night marks writer-director Trey Edward Shults as a talent to watch.
11302	4	a	A very underrated film that is also very truthful
11303	3	a	As he eases toward his subtly stirring resolution, it's hard to resist getting swept up in the moment; for somewhere along the way, Kore-eda has brought us into the fold.
11304	5	a	This half-hearted, obviously obligatory sequel feels labored and twice as long as it really is.
11305	7	a	MacFarlane has a lot of jokes he wants to tell, and the result is an often disgustingly funny movie that is far too long and far too broad.
11306	4	a	The Infiltrator gets by on a stellar lead performance by Bryan Cranston, along with strong support from the cast around him.
11307	1	a	It's a big puffy French pastry of a movie: light, airy, silly, not especially memorable, but delicious while it lasts.
11308	8	a	Astounding movie packed with non-stop action, stunts galore, an interesting story line, great one-liners, a solid cast, a catchy musical score, and all the fun and adventure that you could squeeze into a two-hour thrill ride.
11309	4	a	It's only almost the making of a comedy classic.
11310	4	a	Successfully [shows] the awful lengths individuals and the ruling class will go to in order to preserve power...
11311	6	a	More dutiful than enchanting...terribly episodic and lacking the spark of imagination that might have made it an exhilarating treat.
11312	0	a	Funny and frantic? Sure -- but The Incredibles is also one of the greatest adventures the movies have given us.
11313	5	a	Another of Hollywood's efforts to prove that the American mall mentality is at home in any corner of the globe.
11314	4	a	"True, the stereotypes remain in ""Think Like a Man Too,"" but the actors get a chance to bring them to life, and I even found myself warming to, or at least occasionally laughing at, Hart's relentlessly clownish shtick."
11315	4	a	Christopher Nolan presenta la rivalidad entre dos magos como si se tratara de un vistozo y complejo truco de magia cuyo secreto nos es develado.
11316	2	a	May not be one that goes down in history as a boxing great but with a knockout performance from star Miles Teller and plenty of heart and good humor, it's enough of a contender to warrant ringside seats.
11317	3	a	This year's Being John Malkovich.
11318	3	a	More intelligent and substantive than it is entertaining.
11319	9	a	It's Fellini in Vegas.
11320	3	a	Crimson Peak is one of the year's most handsomely mounted productions. More importantly, it is a film with a palpably beating heart ...
11321	0	a	While it's not the most profound of Spielberg's works or the most entertaining from a popcorn perspective, it's one of the most technically flawless movies he's ever produced.
11322	0	a	The desert is as cold and bleak as McCarthy's view of humanity, so the laughs may not dare even leave your throat.
11323	4	a	Though Macy and Dern offer resolute, solid performances, the viewer is left feeling that their characters are little more than carriers of ideas.
11324	6	a	The human dramas are less involving [than the dogs'], and a pair of teen romances feel like something on the Disney Channel.
11325	3	a	An irresistibly silly, fluffy, giddy bit of fun.
11326	0	a	Beg, borrow or steal a ticket to see it on the biggest screen you can find.
11327	1	a	Hirsch is thoroughly impressive in Penn's best directing effort yet.
11328	6	a	The Darkest Minds has all the elements of a good film, but perhaps the weak link is the source material. In many ways, the plot is lacking and watching it unfold is like coming into something that's already started.
11329	8	a	The best mix in his directorial career between typical Spielbergian flourishes of audience-friendly spectacle and seriousness of intent.
11330	2	a	Transcends its initial culture clash comic riffs to evolve into something altogether more moving by the end. As a result, it's a work of considerable power and pathos.
11331	6	a	"Despite the supposed passion that such material should inspire, what is presented is an emotionally void ""love"" story, which features three cold, distant, and un-likeable characters. "
11332	5	a	Tiresomely and implausibly shot entirely as if found footage, this female-written horror is Rosemary's Baby for the Paranormal Activity generation.
11333	0	a	With no superheroes or post-apocalyptic wastelands in sight, the skill behind Jaws becomes even more thrilling to watch unfold. ... Quite literally, Jaws is the original and the best.
11334	4	a	The latest Disney animation has everything going for it, from a cast including John Travolta and Miley Cyrus to a truly brilliant premise.
11335	1	a	During it all, Bond and M indulge in enough soul-searching conversations to create a real personal drama, and that alone might make this a different and, in some ways, better Bond film.
11336	4	a	A capable supporting cast and a fun cameo from a male megastar add to the appeal of this slight, enjoyable but ultimately predictable journey.
11337	6	a	Stupid fun when it isn't too busy being just plain stupid.
11338	6	a	It doesn't have much more going for it than the rewind gimmick, a very talented cast of actors, and some pretty good action sequences.
11339	5	a	Habemus Poopam.
11340	5	a	There is such an interesting subject but the creation of this character, played by Glenn Close, it's almost like she is mentally challenged.
11341	3	a	Working with non-professional actors from the Pine Ridge community, Zhao tells the fictionalised true story of bareback bronc rider Brady Blackburn.
11342	4	a	A funny, underrated little gem that doesn't say much for Michael Moore as a fictional director, but does showcase his talents as a writer. The last decent John Candy film.
11343	9	a	It's the sort of movie that shortens your life and makes you doubt the existence of God.
11344	0	a	The year's best comedy; one that confirms the arrival of an extended group of talent that looks set to take the studio comedy crown from the likes of Ferrell, Stiller and Carrey.
11345	3	a	A hugely enjoyable set-up for what looks set to be another thrilling trilogy.
11346	2	a	It's an improbable combination that is very funny and shamelessly alcoholic, and evokes -- somewhere in the slurred collapse of its characters -- a fond nostalgia for the good old days.
11347	9	a	All three of you clamoring for a sequel to Wild Wild West have got your wish.
11348	3	a	Richly imagined, robustly performed, and directed with the evident enthusiasm of someone who's been dreaming about Barsoom his whole life, 'John Carter' is a gem.
11349	2	a	It truly is a good movie that will get the audience sucked in; however the tone that David O. Russell has been able to inject into his films takes surprisingly long to surface here.
11350	3	a	Couldn't get enough of the fine, ferociously precise acting work of Bryan Cranston in that torrid TV series Breaking Bad? Then you'll be wanting to track down the compelling real-life crime drama The Infiltrator. 
11351	4	a	It doesn't matter that not all of the songs are memorable or that the performances are of varying success, the warm-hearted Black Nativity feels tailor-made to fit with the good tidings of the season.
11352	0	a	It isn't arty or intellectual, though it is artful and ingenious, and it's the rare crowd-pleaser that never feels obvious or pandering.
11353	5	a	I wish I had been outside of Providence instead of watching this mess.
11354	5	a	There are moments of wit in the script, and one or two strong scenes, but the film feels oddly directionless for much of its runtime.
11355	5	a	The symbolism is right up front and unmissable, and the story part -- the events that in theory should cause our throats to tighten and our pulses to quicken -- is pretty lame.
11356	4	a	Law's performance as archetypal bad-boy Alfie Elkins is immensely enjoyable.
11357	1	a	It's a terrific movie that will work just as well for Bond fans and Bond newbies.
11358	5	a	It's hard not to feel you've just watched a feature-length video game with some really heavy back story.
11359	0	a	It's tough to go wrong when your movie features two of the hottest stars, but director David O. Russell doesn't stop there.
11360	6	a	By the time Smith offers up his unnecessary race-against-the-clock mea culpa, Hitch's cupid's arrow has already veered way off course.
11361	3	a	A pitch-perfect performance from Dern graces Alexander Payne's latest roadmovie - another bittersweet meditation on the sad, comic futility of life.
11362	6	a	While Pixar's masterfulness is found in the subtlety of their approach, The Angry Birds Movie goes for broke in a more visceral approach, packing in pop culture references bound to go over any child's head, no matter how precocious.
11363	5	a	Seyfried, whose heart frankly doesn't even seem to be in this movie, has no discernible chemistry with either of the men in her life.
11364	0	a	A brilliant, engaging examination of people who dream of escape.
11365	2	a	A riveting work that's hilarious, accessible and, sure, timeless in some ways. But still maybe a bit useless, too.
11366	8	a	It feels more like a compilation of skits from a failed comedy show.
11367	6	a	Klapisch has imbued the film with such energy and such insight that his themes linger on the palate, like the aftertaste of a fine French or Spanish or Italian or German or whatever wine.
11368	6	a	a good-natured, but awkward and often unfunny comedy that bounces from sad-sack pathos to slapstick action parody
11369	3	a	Laugh out loud funny at times and gut wrenching at others with just the right amount of bleak material to be intriguing and not overly depressing, Silver Linings Playbook is one of the most genuine and human films of the year.
11370	4	a	Director Sam Mendes, who covered similar ground in American Beauty, evokes the Eisenhower years in every detail and sets a reasonable pace for the script. Yet the path is so familiar that not a step along it takes us by surprise.
11371	2	a	You can't get a whole lot less substantial than this, but well-played, friendly banter is tough to do, and the film hits its mark perfectly on that front.
11372	2	a	It's a kaleidoscopic carnival, structured from the viewpoint of each of its main protagonists. The film itself is devised a species of scam, and for a while it's fun to be in on the con. Russell is, in effect, playing us.
11373	5	a	The whole thing's not much of anything, really - just a little more than an hour-and-a-half of crude jokes and clumsy plotting, all wrapped up with a feel-good ribbon at the end.
11374	6	a	Entertaining ... but you do wish they'd tell the tale without funnelling it through Hollywood's inspirational movie assembly line.
11375	5	a	Insulting story, but well-performed.
11376	5	a	Doesn't pay off.
11377	6	a	Remarkably forced--ironic, considering it's a starring vehicle for an actor whose most defining quality is his laid-back, unaffected demeanor.
11378	5	a	'Alpha and Omega' enters the crowded marketplace with little to say for itself.
11379	6	a	Leaden when the lead isn't flying. 
11380	5	a	The story itself is weakly conceived and doesn't sustain a feature-length movie.
11381	2	a	Old fashioned spirit and resolve work well in a movie like 'Evelyn.'
11382	3	a	To play off of the Heavy D/Aaron Hall classic, now that Smith has found a love story, what is Hollywood gonna do with him? I look forward to finding out.
11383	3	a	The story is incredible.
11384	4	a	Finishes the series' natural allegorical evolution.
11385	0	a	The Closet worthy of coming out for.
11386	4	a	"Backed by his newfound A-list stardom, Downey brings to the project a wry swagger -- crucial in an essentially reactive role. I wish, though, that ""The Soloist"" hadn't spent so much time dealing with Lopez's crises of conscience and career, even as they r"
11387	6	a	Too stilted and pre-programmed to come alive.
11388	3	a	While things get a bit Dawson's Creek-y at times, director Greg Berlanti never allows the narrative's melodrama to overtake the more significant themes that make a film like Love, Simon a milestone for mainstream gay movies. 
11389	3	a	Three times in the course of Team America: World Police I laughed so hard I thought I was crying, and when I checked, sure enough.
11390	3	a	Yet its story moves along with efficiency.
11391	5	a	Not only sad, sad, sad but dreary and unpleasant, peopled with largely unsympathetic characters but for McTeer, who is great.
11392	3	a	This is a movie that means to keep you involved and, preferably, gasping from start to finish . At that, it certainly does succeed.
11393	4	a	[A] tame exercise in hedonism and self-discovery.
11394	3	a	We have powerful chemistry between Fanny Ardant and Catherine Deneuve in a film that does its trivial thing with real aplomb.
11395	6	a	Strange, cerebral, immensely interesting and weirdly, thoroughly distancing, Dancer in the Dark is a movie like they used to make 'em.
11396	5	a	Occupies some strange middle ground for people in the mood for not much thinking and a little action, but not too much.
11397	4	a	Its favouring of visceral revulsion over dramatic tension may deter general audiences, but for fans of the ludicrous and the gross, Slugs has much to offer.
11398	4	a	Juggles way too many ideas and can't seem to think, think, think on which to aim towards, resulting in a very tonally imbalanced mess. At least it's primary strength is the retainment of our beloved characters' innocent charm.
11399	4	a	Coach Carter will be greeted with reviews that overflow with sports metaphors. Let's just say that the movie scores solidly.
11400	0	a	A hugely enjoyable, acutely observed and frequently hilarious coming-of-age drama with a delightful script, likeable characters and terrific performances from a note-perfect cast.
11401	4	a	For those new to the character, this smart mystery succeeds in introducing viewers to this delightful little world.
11402	4	a	As a precursor to better zombie films, it remains an important, passably entertaining genre milestone.
11403	6	a	Will Smith fans will likely be disappointed, and lovers of fine cinema best look elsewhere. But if you're looking for robots going crazy, this one's worth your money.
11404	6	a	Romantic comedy is a tough genre to pull off in this crass and explicit day and age. This movie gives it a perky try, but its formula, unlike its hired-for-the-occasion leading man, just isn't the right package.
11405	2	a	This isn't perfect filmmaking, but it's pleasant enough and a pleasure to watch.
11406	3	a	The director, Julian Jarrold, is comfortable with the material, and it is comfortable with him.
11407	4	a	A noble failure, perhaps, but whatever you make of its unwieldy plot machinations, Inherent Vice's smoky Californian atmosphere is guaranteed to rouse your senses.
11408	4	a	The movie begins extremely well before escalating into the inevitable Straw Dogs confrontation, when the sensitive-intellectual man discovers, just like Dustin Hoffman, that when push comes to shove, we're all brutes and animals.
11409	4	a	There is just too much going on in Donnie Darko.
11410	10	a	A completely unintentional laugh riot and, in that sense, top-drawer Crichton.
11411	6	a	Don't let the subtitles fool you; the movie only proves that Hollywood no longer has a monopoly on mindless action.
11412	2	a	...a galvanizing amusement-park ride that only occasionally steps over the bounds of common sense.
11413	3	a	The emotions found in Bright Star are raw and passionate, and are magnificently presented in the most simplest and natural moments.
11414	6	a	The directionless script wanders all over the Vegas strip without ever establishing stakes worth caring about.
11415	4	a	A beautiful, languid travelogue, although with some of the source novel's empowerment diluted.
11416	4	a	Masterpieces of literature-to-film are a rare breed; this film falls short with satisfaction.
11417	3	a	MacFarlane knows his audience and A Million Ways to Die in the West is one of the funniest films of the year - provided you're a member of his audience.
11418	5	a	Never mind plot: a lot of it isn't even comprehensible.
11419	5	a	It's not that Wimpy Kid is a bad film, it's more that this idea has been done before, and better, on TV with Malcolm, Reese and Dewey.
11420	4	a	MacFarlane's die-hard fans may find the silver lining in this movie, but everyone else will likely find A Million Ways to Die in the West one of this summer's big disappointments.
11421	2	a	Moore's performance is exquisitely nuanced - the only thing worth remembering about this otherwise tone-deaf weepie. 
11422	4	a	Wilson, Dillon and Hudson are likable stars, and there are moments when their characters make a convincing circle of friends. But the Russo brothers don't have the maturity to blend the two prongs of the story they've written.
11423	5	a	It's not the sign of a particularly good film when the entire cast could be replaced by belligerent three-year-olds and you could expect most of the line readings to remain exactly the same.
11424	2	a	At the end of the day, Bolt is a sweet Disney family film, but Lasseter's oversight has made it smarter than it otherwise would have been.
11425	4	a	works in its own right as a semi-campy gloss on mad scientists, the horrors of medical experimentation, and our own conflicted relationships with the bodies we call home
11426	4	a	This movie may be sickly sweet, but it's harmless; and as a handcrafted antidote to a toxic toy story like G.I.Joe, Paper Heart has healing properties.
11427	4	a	The actors emote deeply and energetically, but there's a disquieting sheen of artifice.
11428	6	a	...a forgettable teen drama that's rarely as compelling as its various performances...
11429	3	a	Partially filmed in genuine weightless conditions, Ron Howard's movie is a technical tour de force.
11430	1	a	Save your admiration for the performances, especially Lawrence, who is now Hollywood's most important presence in front of the camera.
11431	3	a	Painting an achingly, literally real portrait of a lifestyle that is usually mocked and played for cheap laughs on screen rather than shown empathy, The Rider offers unshakably devastating insight
11432	3	a	A trio of kids enjoy a rollicking adventure
11433	1	a	Impresses on most every conceivable level: as a pure film, as wild, speculative storytelling, and, like Murnau's own Nosferatu, a benchmark ranking among the most ingenious vampire movies ever crafted.
11434	3	a	...I Origins is the fully-formed expression of all of [Mike] Cahill's ambitious ideas. It also cements him as the real deal; a filmmaker who will hopefully continue to take us to places full of mystery, wonder and awe. 
11435	5	a	"American Pastoral"" is an earnest first effort, but the source material may have been a bit too much for a director's debut."
11436	3	a	I had a lot of fun watching this. 
11437	3	a	Energising, stylish and engrossing, although its scattershot chronology and egocentric approach might not be to everyone;s taste.
11438	3	a	A sleek espionage thriller that reduces the world to the size of a postage stamp. Matt Damon is terrific.
11439	3	a	Chock full of folksy predictability and transient emotion.
11440	3	a	A stylish and very funny teenage coming-of-age story graced with surreal fringes and a mysteriously hushed core.
11441	3	a	An effective spectacle of violence.
11442	3	a	Perfectly pitched and bolstered by four beautiful lead performances, Our Little Sister, with the gentlest of touches, both breaks one's heart and makes it swoon.
11443	2	a	An ensemble-cast mishmash of crime and betrayal that manages to work.
11444	3	a	I watched, fascinated, as one of the most gifted athletes I have ever had the privilege to watch worked his magic.
11445	4	a	Melodramatic episodes sit oddly with the dark comedy. But it's still a giggle ...
11446	6	a	For all the pleasure there is in seeing effective, great-looking black women grappling with major life issues on screen, Waiting to Exhale is an uneven piece.
11447	3	a	Inspiring tale about Mandela, rugby, and national pride.
11448	9	a	The vocal characterizations aren't the problem here; the script and the animation are the problems, and in feature animation, you can't arrange more significant problems than those.
11449	4	a	"True to its title, as well as its flawed but sympathetic protagonist, ""Whiskey Tango Foxtrot"" is more confused than cynical or opportunistic. Its bewilderment is contagious, and ultimately endearing."
11450	5	a	Presents itself as being about Something Important, whereas in fact it is really about nothing very much at all.
11451	3	a	"A movie that doesn't know what ""failure of nerve"" means."
11452	0	a	The Artist is apparently Hazanavicius' dream project and it's truly inspiring to see a filmmaker take such a big risk in this day and age: especially when it pays off so big.
11453	6	a	McConaughey and Parker try, but they can't save a premise as insipid as this one.
11454	7	a	"The Infiltrator"" is unsatisfying and weirdly absurd at times, but it's not a complete blunder."
11455	5	a	A Tyler Perry movie for white folks. 
11456	6	a	Even though there's some great scenery and tremendous dishes of French cuisine to drool over, the viewer feels a little restless, eager for the movie to get where it's going.
11457	4	a	It opts for pleasant Christmas fantasy instead of phony sentimentality.
11458	0	a	The duo may have created their most accomplished and compelling movie to date.
11459	9	a	Outstandingly bad.
11460	3	a	The Imitation Game is a classic 'race against time' tale with the added intrigue of how the authorities would deign to use the information they had once Enigma had been cracked.
11461	6	a	Kontroll throws beaucoup intriguing mysteries at us, but the solutions aren't worth the trip.
11462	3	a	Ostensibly a snapshot of postwar Japan in the midst of profound cultural change, it is the movie's painful depiction of familial disintegration that remains universal today.
11463	0	a	A marvellous caper-movie throwback.
11464	3	a	There's truth in the movie's point that when you're born with protective gloves on, you might not notice when you're playing with fire.
11465	0	a	Sure, some if it may be a bit too cute for words, but the smile on your face will overcome the feelings of Bah Humbug that might be trying to sneak out of you. 
11466	2	a	It Comes At Night will divide horror audiences, but that doesn't stop Trey Edward Shults' deadly-tense doomsday thriller.
11467	8	a	Stay is a cheap trick. Avoid it.
11468	5	a	Kaufman's film is flawed. but not as bad as critics claim-- charges of racism made this adaptation controversial even before it was seen.
11469	2	a	This is cheeky British irreverence at its best, and there's even a bit of meaning and moral behind it all if you can see through the laughter.
11470	8	a	Boring, bland and self indulgent Vanity piece for Angelina Jolie.
11471	4	a	Nevertheless, Arctic Tale is a kid-friendly, non-preachy window on the north as a place of wonder and a harbinger of change -- and I'll take Queen Latifah's warm voice over Al Gore's drone any day.
11472	8	a	We just keep wishing they would get out of the way and let us enjoy the pretty scenery.
11473	4	a	Has moments of inspired dark hilarity.
11474	5	a	Good Luck Chuck has its moments - though the half-decent comedy moments are outweighed by the gags that fizzle and the cruddy loutish moments.
11475	4	a	... the most fun I've had with food since I was a child recreating the extinction of the dinosaurs with dino-shaped nuggets, my mouth, and a giant pool of ketchup.
11476	1	a	Like the Ancient Mariner, Nelson grabs us by the collar and says, You must know about this. You must bear witness. And so you do.
11477	0	a	Padilha is onto so many issues sparked by one relatively simple act of crime.
11478	4	a	Raucous football tale with effective Nolte.
11479	4	a	Padilha gets as close to the daily violence as City of God, though this feels more like a documentary than an epic.
11480	6	a	Sam Hoffman respects his characters and evinces curiosity about their lives-and these qualities aren't to be taken for granted. But he isn't willing to disrupt his familiar and tightly structured plot. 
11481	5	a	If you're going to base a movie on a song, why not choose a song that's, y'know, about something?
11482	0	a	No movie in memory feels as necessary as Selma, while the history it portrays is echoed by current events. When the value of black lives is asserted in the streets by marchers of all colors, spurred by wrongs to be righted, indignities to overcome.
11483	3	a	A balls to the wall action film, and never for a second does it deviate.
11484	5	a	Has ideas, but ideas alone do not a successful movie make.
11485	3	a	Fassbender is glorious, while Vikander is his equal.
11486	3	a	If you can get past the subject matter, you'll find yourself challenged and yes, even entertained.
11487	1	a	Like Broadcast News, James L. Brooks' new film is a dark-edged adult comedy that hits the spot for those who like their romances splashed with acidic wit.
11488	3	a	This hugely enjoyable comedy shows that you don't need massive budgets or stars for success: likeable characters and smart ideas are more than enough.
11489	6	a	A flat-footed, studious stroll through what most folks would consider a long-forgotten chapter of history.
11490	3	a	One of the first movies to parody gangsta rap, it does so knowingly and affectionately.
11491	4	a	It's good, but from this director we have come to expect great.
11492	3	a	It's the sheer silliness of the proposition... that makes Early Man hum along.
11493	2	a	Choose strong performances, choose a rocking playlist, choose intoxicating visual flair. 
11494	3	a	Who can resist such ravishing travel porn?
11495	9	a	The willfully absurd action sequences help the movie slog along, but slog it does, right through to the obligatory after-credits scene to establish the possibility of a franchise.
11496	6	a	Pretty sure I spotted a credit at the end of the movie for a tear-bucket grip.
11497	4	a	"Once you've gotten your tongue around that awkward little title you might actually enjoy ""Billy's Hollywood Screen Kiss."" I did."
11498	3	a	There's no arguing with the performances.
11499	0	a	McDonagh's latest work is simply exceptional; a film rich with narrative fluidity, profane laughs, standout performances and complex character studies.
11500	6	a	Mel Gibson shows once again that he's skilled at depicting violence. But you'd be hard pressed to find evidence of 'tolerance, love and forgiveness' that the producer-director-co-writer insists he's trying to communicate.
11501	4	a	There are cracks in the foundation, but it is nevertheless a surprisingly watchable production.
11502	4	a	For all its flaws, The World's End is fun. It's not as appealing as Shaun Of The Dead, but I preferred it to Hot Fuzz.
11503	3	a	This will have all non-Greeks in the audience wishing they could lay claim to some Mediterranean heritage.
11504	1	a	Offers more of [Zhang Yimou's] beautiful photography, graceful staging, intricately choreographed fight scenes and metaphorical imagery.
11505	3	a	The film is a magical experience.
11506	0	a	"Matt Damon and Paul Greengrass have created a fiery, quick-witted film that presents compelling evidence that the action-suspense genre has been ""Bourne again."
11507	4	a	How David escapes, alas, is less compelling than wondering how this drearily earnest movie escaped the Hallmark Channel. 
11508	1	a	Van Sant's teens are angels slowly sullied by a demonic world.
11509	6	a	The analysis of the beats comes across as superficial.
11510	4	a	A paean to the loveable losers in show biz who give it all they've got but still cup up short.
11511	3	a	The film has most of the qualities that made the show so wonderful, including the most important one: the feeling that it's not enough.
11512	3	a	[Brewer] takes fearsome advantage of the steaming sexuality and thick pulp on display, while underscoring it with a deep sense of intimacy.
11513	2	a	Epic romantic comedy that I believe every Irishman must have seen at least once.
11514	3	a	Lovely and astounding, Mao's Last Dancer is a modern epic of art and ambition triumphing oppression.
11515	9	a	...drops the ball almost immediately by emphasizing some seriously hackneyed plot twists and an overall atmosphere of predictability...
11516	3	a	Obama could use a Rugby World Cup. Something to unite his disaffected nation.
11517	5	a	A weary retread without a fraction of the inventiveness that sparked the original.
11518	2	a	If you liked any of the previous movies, you should be even more thrilled by what they've done this time around with a lot more at play here in terms of storytelling.
11519	0	a	A beautiful film and a strikingly truthful one, and not because it waxes too philosophic or throws down the intellectual gauntlet.
11520	4	a	...rowdy, discordant, subversive and thoroughly modern, exactly what you'd expect when a stoner and a visual genius team up...
11521	4	a	It is the band, the group - with or without Sutcliffe - that makes Backbeat such a powerfully emotional elegy.
11522	3	a	Almost always convinces and involves the viewer.
11523	6	a	As retro as a Katherine Heigl chick flick.
11524	6	a	Then there's the matter of the screenplay, which places everything in a haze of mannered syntax and enigmatic phrasing.
11525	3	a	What a sweet, gentle and feisty movie Evelyn is.
11526	5	a	A colorful, young-skewing flick... but one as hopelessly bland as it is behind the times.
11527	3	a	Fincher mainly succeeds in making the movie charming, a ride as gentle and whimsical as its protagonist, a technical triumph backing, yes, a curious narrative.
11528	1	a	Howard does a marvelous job of making the cerebral exploits of these pencil-chewing, chain-smoking guys the stuff of real adventure.
11529	4	a	Doesn't do anything new as either a horror or a gothic romance, but makes up for it with the sumptuous, engrossing visuals that are del Toro's hallmark. It really is a shame.
11530	3	a	Love, Simon is so full of heart and emotion that you can't help but fall in love with it.
11531	4	a	Just let the expressionistic, oddly charming images wash over you and enjoy the rush of a zero-budget indie that somehow fuses Buck Rogers and the theater of the absurd.
11532	4	a	And if you're still not willing to forgive Hancock, and least there is the scene where he shoves a guy's head up another guy's butt.
11533	9	a	The whole enterprise is a tremendous wasted opportunity. Even the title knows it.
11534	4	a	It is under-plotted and preposterous but quite fun.
11535	3	a	Amistad is educational, powerful, and intriguing throughout.
11536	4	a	Crimson Peak knows you know what it's doing.
11537	6	a	Overall, Bleed for This is a conventional boxing saga about the improbable comeback of a fallen and flawed champ.
11538	1	a	It begs for repeated viewings and will likely get them from moviegoers who want to crack Nolan's own theatrical magic trick.
11539	0	a	A sensuous and emotionally cathartic adaptation of Elizabeth Gilbert's spiritual journey to personal transformation and love.
11540	3	a	It isn't one film but many, an anthology of expertly recreated genre tropes, from fog-shrouded noir to sunlit paranoia.
11541	8	a	The man who gave human dimension to the effects of holocaust in Schindler's List has now prostituted human extermination for entertainment. Bread and circuses, indeed.
11542	4	a	While not quite on the level of The Lego Movie, this is an energetic and entertaining adventure that won't ruffle the feathers of any dragged-along adults.
11543	4	a	A good effort, but the star power on show throws the proceedings off kilter somewhat, hiking up an expectation that the film ultimately cannot live up to.
11544	1	a	Theron's performance really is amazing, helped by the makeup, hair, and costumes
11545	3	a	A collection of some of the best physical comedy since Moe first smacked Curly on the head.
11546	1	a	This smart, absorbing movie, which has been sharply edited by Felipe Lacerda, never feels like it's spreading itself too thin.
11547	3	a	An innovative, ingenious and spectacular sci-fi adventure. The special effects are truly dazzling.
11548	1	a	Firmly grounded in a deeply affecting, even wounding, emotional reality.
11549	1	a	An inventive, hypnotic and intelligent urban fable.
11550	9	a	There are bad movies, there are disappointing movies, and then there's Pootie Tang, a movie so incompetent, it almost defies description.
11551	3	a	American and European cinema has amassed a vast Holocaust literature, but it is impossible to think of any film more challenging or depressing than The Grey Zone.
11552	0	a	Visual wonders are just a mind-blowing bonus in a film which uses character-driven hero stories to make something incredibly smart.
11553	3	a	I'd go to As Good as It Gets and not worry too much about its structural ungainliness.
11554	6	a	Miller bears an uncanny resemblance to Sedgwick and gives a striking, emotionally raw performance that deserves a much more richly imagined and vividly rendered narrative backdrop than the superficial one provided by Factory Girl.
11555	3	a	This winning comedy about a gay high schooler looking for love hits you right in the heart.
11556	3	a	Lots of grub jokes, catchy musical interludes and a satisfying villainess with the voice of Suzanne Pleshette.
11557	8	a	Identity Thief molests the idea of the 'odd couple' beyond recognition.
11558	0	a	Embracing the techniques and look of the times, and paying homage to numerous silent classics and Citizen Kane, this loving, warm pastiche is a sheer delight.
11559	3	a	Every time the film gets obvious in its anti-colonial perspective, it draws you in with its mesmerizing look and skin-crawly sound design.
11560	4	a	The man who invented the modern zombie film comes back to his roots with this spooky, goopy horror flick about power and survival.
11561	9	a	Writer and director Daniel Taplitz piles on the convolutions in an overripe comedy of sitcom stock characters and bad jokes.
11562	6	a	The filmmakers would rather exploit and inflame a class war than deconstruct it.
11563	4	a	What the Grahame of Film Stars Don't Die in Liverpool is missing in detail, Bening makes up for in affection. Her performance is a kind of rebuke to the arc and tragic Norma Desmond view of aging movie actresses. 
11564	3	a	Neeson's a force of nature in Neil Jordan's near-excellent historical epic.
11565	6	a	Bee Movie is never an unpleasant experience, but it's never a particularly engaging or funny film either.
11566	2	a	No Country For Old Men is a strong addition to the Coen Bros. shelf and will certainly please fans of crime stories while exciting action aficionados. And both groups will chuckle more than once.
11567	4	a	What makes this peppy kids' film interesting is the human/robot apartheid system that has evolved in the futuristic world that Astro inhabits.
11568	1	a	Donaldson and his fine crew and cast have given the depiction of this crucial event with the care and attention to details that make this one of the finest docudramas of the year.
11569	3	a	[A] blood-boiling documentary.
11570	5	a	The many tunes in Country Strong are of such astounding banality, it's as if they were written by caged chimps as they were driven through Nashville on the way to a medical research lab.
11571	9	a	The equivalent of Spielberg during Raiders dropping thirty people in a row into the Well of the Souls, having them stare down the same snake, letting it lunge and then dropping another person down.
11572	6	a	Given the capable performances and a few memorable scenes, it's difficult to pinpoint why this handsome, competent production can't offer much more satisfaction...
11573	3	a	"Against the odds, ""John Carter'' is itself pretty amazing - an epic pulp saga that slowly rises to the level of its best imitations and wins you over by degrees."
11574	4	a	"Corbijn keeps the action of ""A Most Wanted Man"" at arms length or greater, never finding the heart of the piece despite mostly solid performances and strong production values."
11575	3	a	Emotional, crowd-pleasing sequel to popular documentary. 
11576	10	a	Can we finally just admit that Dane Cook isn't funny?
11577	5	a	A painfully earnest but dramatically feeble feel-good fable about cultural diversity, sexual tolerance and gender equality.
11578	4	a	You, Me and Dupree is an inconsistent trifle - by turns cute and annoying - and not much more.
11579	9	a	Messing should know this is precisely the kind of movie Grace would ridicule Will for dragging her to see.
11580	1	a	Jarmusch continues to be one of the most intriguing and compelling filmmakers of the age.
11581	4	a	A nice try, but overall, no dice.
11582	4	a	Bereford makes the best of a workmanlike script, the children -- particularly young Vavasseur -- are undeniably adorable, and there's a nice turn by Alan Bates.
11583	6	a	"Don't Say a Word"" pleads on bended knee for its audience to abandon common sense."
11584	4	a	Meditative and downbeat rather than crowd-pleasing.
11585	5	a	A hunk of expensive, lifeless junk.
11586	4	a	Visually stunning, while utterly mentally mundane.
11587	1	a	A movie that ultimately has more cult than mass appeal, how much you enjoy Bad Lieutenant will probably come down to how much you like Werner Herzog rather than Nicolas Cage. A notoriously eccentric director, his latest film is nowhere near as mainstream
11588	2	a	Close can't keep the character from seemingly like a pitiable doormat, but the tears come nonetheless.
11589	6	a	"I can think of so many ways to have fun with a political story such as this. Too bad the makers of ""Mooseport"" couldn't settle on just one and run with it."
11590	5	a	Gladiator can aptly be called a typical summer movie, meaning it is mindless and designed for the lowest common denominator.
11591	5	a	It is Beavis and Butt-head rewriting The In-Laws, only the scripts for Beavis were much smarter.
11592	1	a	Retaining the hilarious chaos and offhand hipness expected of Mssrs. Wright, Pegg and Frost, The World's End doesn't quite spark with Shaun of the Dead's audacious freshness, but is great fun and a definite improvement over the fizz-free Hot Fuzz.
11593	4	a	A giant overdose of testosterone mixed with soap opera for muscleheads and gearheads.
11594	3	a	A return to the admired television series is equal parts fun and frustrating.
11595	1	a	Needless to say, Dr. King's message has never been more relevant. 
11596	4	a	The movie has a few good tunes and some charming comic dash, at least at first.
11597	2	a	A Most Wanted Man is a cold film that examines its characters from a clinical distance, but its iciness gives way to raw emotion in a powerful final sequence.
11598	4	a	The lack of pretense makes it far less odious than 'Me and Earl and the Dying Girl' - that, and that it features a black friend who has more than one dimension and a life of his own and everything.
11599	5	a	I know, I know, I'm supposed to get sentimental about this heart-warming tale. But I couldn't believe a moment of it, and never identified with little David.
11600	2	a	War, what is it good for? Absolutely nothing but a good couple of hours at the theater.
11601	3	a	The Prestige retains a mesmerizing hold on the audience, and it returns magic to the realm of the real, where craftsmanship and stage presence are just as thrilling as the physical act of disappearance.
11602	5	a	"The problem is, like Freeway, the dog, ""Darling Companion"" seems to have lost its way as it just wanders looking for someplace to land."
11603	0	a	On some levels soars above its predecessor with a more personal story; credible, menacing villains and an impeccable cast.
11604	0	a	A shockingly funny spellbinder.
11605	6	a	It's a movie that dances around the ring and doesn't throw a single punch that surprises. It's certainly not a winning formula.
11606	5	a	When Martin puts Clifford on a harrowing hyperspeed version of the Larry the Scary Rex ride, the special effects are impressive, but not worth waiting for.
11607	6	a	Ewan McGregor chooses an adaptation of Philip Roth's Pulitzer Prize-winning novel for his first directing gig, and it's not a total disaster, especially considering the scale of the book.
11608	2	a	Cosmopolis demonstrates that even a flawed throwback to Cronenberg's roots proves they run fairly deep.
11609	5	a	Here is a Christmas package that should have been left on the shelf.
11610	2	a	The ultimate lesson? Sometimes you make a noble point by acting like a jackass.
11611	5	a	A film that simply doesn't have enough cinematic flair to make it a better than average cops and robbers thriller.
11612	7	a	Stallone's much ballyhooed performance is adequate for what he is. So he decided to drink a bunch of milkshakes and get fat--so what? Millions of Americans do that daily.
11613	5	a	And here I thought the aliens ate them the first time.
11614	3	a	'The Great Beauty' is certainly striking, but too often what it's striking are poses.
11615	3	a	The movie comes closest to thematic coherence, and the popular mood, in its depiction of something nearly everyone can relate to: the office from hell.
11616	2	a	Goofy adventures ensue.
11617	3	a	It's refreshing to see an animated movie that doesn't look as though the idea for the Happy Meal came first.
11618	3	a	Exorcism aside, Dominion is well-acted, handsomely photographed and hauntingly scored.
11619	7	a	Aside from a brief split-screen sequence and a few deft special-effects, there's almost no sizzle to this goofy take on superheroics.
11620	2	a	Nowhere near a perfect movie but it navigates Roth's cloudy waters surprisingly well ... and there are moments that are absolutely heartbreaking.
11621	3	a	...an above-average neo-noir...
11622	5	a	It seems acutely unaware of how casually sick some of its themes are.
11623	4	a	[A] funny, though formulaic, mismatched-duo comedy ...
11624	2	a	Fantastic Four is a movie that could have been a lot better - but it could also have been a lot worse.
11625	6	a	The film doesn't rush to solve the mystery of whether Ian the skeptic is discovering a new realm of spiritual activity or merely grasping at coincidence and magical thinking.
11626	3	a	Perhaps Hammer's most effectively horrific Dracula movie.
11627	2	a	It feels less like a coherent narrative than a series of vignettes in which the characters say improbably witty things and act in ways that aren't tethered to rational behavior. We sense them performing for the camera.
11628	4	a	Husband-and-wife filmmakers Ravetch and Robertson capture some breathtaking images. And a global-warming warning, which is saved for the end, is much subtler than the one in last year's animated hit Happy Feet.
11629	3	a	Director Steven Spielberg has constructed a chillingly frightening film.
11630	3	a	Certainly no worse than the later Roger Moore efforts and, if only for curiosity value, is well worth a look.
11631	4	a	Not-half-bad murder-thriller potboiler.
11632	2	a	The movie isn't revolutionary and doesn't aim to create a whole new wave of silent filmmaking, but it is a fun diversion.
11633	2	a	[Cheadle] brings warmth, humor, and vulnerability to a role that could easily have been a Good Morning, Vietnam-level blunder.
11634	6	a	Lawrence Kasdan's fitfully amusing comedy-drama starring Diane Keaton and Kevin Kline.
11635	3	a	If you like Black's work, you'll enjoy The Predator, plain and simple. His jokey attitude, taste for violence, and overall tone are in full effect. He doesn't take things too seriously, which is key.
11636	4	a	A bit of a genre hybrid that, for all its anime coolness, doesn't quite transcend the commonplaces of the genres it's splicing together.
11637	0	a	A mediocre film would use Elio's parents as a one-note backdrop to his affair: oblivious, disbelieving, disapproving or draconian. Here they are none of those things. 
11638	3	a	"The odd thing about the saying ""too much of a good thing"" is that it acknowledges the fact that, something, in general, is composed of an overabundance of excellence."
11639	1	a	Would that every feel-good movie came by its good feelings so honestly.
11640	4	a	Don't blame the Bard for Letters to Juliet
11641	4	a	Even through Bachmann's exasperated sighs, surreptitious swigs of booze and shuffles through clouds of cigarette smoke, Hoffman manages to be utterly magnetic.
11642	6	a	The monster might live, but unfortunately it gets lost within all the chaos surrounding him.
11643	4	a	Like any template, it has the skeleton but is missing the meat.
11644	6	a	All three acts suffer from sluggish momentum and weak endings.
11645	3	a	Jennifer Aniston shines in a sincere and funny film from the writer and director of Chuck and Buck.
11646	9	a	[Brolin] is done in by the deathless mediocrity of the production, an assemblage of random camera shots, messy editing, redundant scenes, and witless dialogue as haphazardly stitched together as the flesh on Jonah Hex's face.
11647	1	a	The chemistry between Cage -- who successfully makes Roy both funny and recognizably human, even when the character is going around the bend -- and Lohman makes their oddball dialogues every bit as intriguing as the various scams...
11648	3	a	Given the content of this movie, I can't officially recommend it to anyone. But go anyway.
11649	0	a	Showcases Miyazaki's delightful iconography of spirits, demons, and wood sprites at its most gentle.
11650	4	a	"Since for most of us, it's too late to pack a suitcase, spend a year in beautiful Barcelona, and fall so easily in and out of love, ""L'Auberge Espagnole"" is a lovely cinematic diversion."
11651	5	a	It's hard to tell if the other actors are awful or if it's the script.
11652	4	a	an angry film for an angry country
11653	2	a	The sparse, cold satisfaction that could be wrung from Trainspotting's punk insolence has been replaced by an exhausted cynicism. Which is exactly right.
11654	0	a	... strong, evocative storytelling pared to the bone and braced with a sensibility perfectly matched to the material.
11655	4	a	Technically flawless but not especially moving.
11656	6	a	Don't blame the leads, but the movie has less emotional resonance than an old FTD florist commercial with Merlin Olsen.
11657	4	a	Gladiator pours on the usual Caesar dressing.
11658	3	a	I liked it a lot, aside from the ending, which made me want to burn down the theater.
11659	5	a	Cranston deserves a better role, and we deserve a better film.
11660	5	a	A film that's as clunky as its title.
11661	3	a	The picture returns to the biting humor of the first FD and, in fact, improves and deepens the Rube Goldberg-ian deathtrap scenarios.
11662	1	a	Shares some themes with Lynch's The Elephant Man.
11663	3	a	It's a transcendent work of art.
11664	1	a	There is an infinite sadness involving Zhao's The Rider but also an immeasurable humanity.
11665	6	a	This is pretty light fare, but it does not pretend to be anything but a populist popcorn flick shot to be shown in the latter part of the summer.
11666	9	a	Inept, tedious kitsch that even at its best feels like John Waters minus the joie de vivre.
11667	4	a	Haunting film, with unexpectedly great supporting performances by Caan and Paltrow
11668	3	a	Often-uproarious.
11669	3	a	It's impossible to tell the experienced from the inexperienced among Loach's casts.
11670	9	a	Crude, vulgar and dispiriting to watch.
11671	3	a	Each of the characters is real and interesting and appealing. Each has some self-awareness and each approaches the lessons along with road with grace. 
11672	5	a	The film seems like a throwback not to old horror comics but to bad syndicated TV horror.
11673	4	a	"Is redemption possible for this bad lieutenant? At one point, he orders that a dead man be shot again because ""his soul is still dancing."" If you find God in that line, then welcome to your movie heaven."
11674	7	a	There's an awful lot of dead time in this picture, and while it's a bit too sweet and innocent to utterly despise, there's nothing there to really like.
11675	3	a	[Amy] Berg has crafted a disturbing and well-made documentary that sheds additional light on this continuously unfolding scandal.
11676	0	a	One of the best Bond movie ever, this thriller offers up great action sequences and a smart dialogue. 
11677	4	a	Instead of tightening up its storyline, Waist Deep gets more outlandish with its plot complications.
11678	5	a	You can't take such sleazy surroundings and try to make it the setting of true love, especially after turning an opportunist into a tortured lover
11679	9	a	Just because a film is about dance doesn't mean it can function without a plot and a modicum of decent dialogue. Step Up: All In has neither.
11680	5	a	A pastiche of past thrillers, recycling its elements from The Shining, Misery, The Dark Half and just about every other King project this side of The Mangler.
11681	3	a	it's certainly a prime slice of cheese-o-rama cinema, chock-full of gratuitous gore and nudity... This is truly filmmaking as seen through a fun-house mirror.
11682	4	a	The body count is enormous, the explosions deafening, and none of it makes sense -- so why did I find this such a guilty pleasure?
11683	4	a	Has all the mechanized ingenuity of one of those dazzling Tripods, but the bigger they are....it's the gutless ending that renders War of the Worlds most insulting.
11684	3	a	With its unusual setting, winning characters and engaging performances, it's an affectionate coming-of-age tale whose sweetness never becomes cloying.
11685	3	a	Not only is [Charlize] Theron completely convincing as Florida serial killer Aileen Wuornos, she's virtually unrecognizable.
11686	4	a	Cassavetes uses a wide arsenal of flashy techniques...but his stylistic fourishes and some committed performances cannot disguise a certain emptiness where there should be tragedy.
11687	2	a	Cholodenko's second film is slicker but less satisfying than her first, but features another Oscar calibre performance from Frances McDormand, who has simply never been better than she is here
11688	8	a	Dull and unfunny claptrap.
11689	6	a	Dark Habits is a film in love with films and pop culture in general.
11690	10	a	There's something wrong with the cast of Jackass, and the simple fact of the matter is that watching people satisfy their masochistic tendencies isn't fun or funny.
11691	8	a	I feel a strange disturbance in the Force.
11692	3	a	Infectiously silly vampire farce that's a lot more elegant than it had to be.
11693	7	a	"At one point, a character says: ""Let the brown foaming mess wash all over you."" Whatever you are imagining happening at this juncture, I promise you it's worse. "
11694	4	a	Gleaming, but not without faults.
11695	5	a	A waste of three fine actors.
11696	3	a	They play an emotional game of chicken - and we all win.
11697	5	a	Toy planes might fly at Christmas, but Flight of the Phoenix got stuck halfway down the chimney. Ho, Ho, No...
11698	5	a	In need of a major tonal and aesthetic makeover, The Last Witch Hunter is as bland as bland can be.
11699	6	a	There's nothing happening behind all the imagistic dada.
11700	3	a	Definitely a film worthy of your quarters.
11701	5	a	It's a nearly tone-deaf satire of American politics and the culture of celebrity, a comedy without enough laughs, a satire without enough bite.
11702	9	a	Never has a movie franchise fallen so far so fast.
11703	6	a	This one is more headache-inducing than mind-blowing.
11704	4	a	At the very least, it's better for American film culture that this exists than if it didn't. 
11705	4	a	As we get a chance to see him as a child and a young man, our curiosity may be satisfied, but the additional detail that humanizes him makes him far less interesting.
11706	3	a	...works as a thriller, but the movie is far more interesting as a clever exercise in audience implication. It forces us to consider the cannibal within.
11707	3	a	American Hustle is a very well acted tale of con artists and their volatile relationships.
11708	3	a	Payne directs the film in a relatively uncluttered manner, ensuring the film plays out as a slowly unravelling elegant narrative.
11709	6	a	... delivers exactly what the coming attractions promise - a lot of over-the-top action and silliness ...
11710	2	a	Unabashedly blends genre and style as black comedy meets romantic drama and the elegant clashes with the grotesque, to make for a spirited and visually engaging romp of a movie.
11711	6	a	Beautiful, violent -- and also funny for all the wrong reasons, and boring.
11712	9	a	Dull and oddly outdated, only the lush photography by Hurlbut, accentuating its gorgeous Toronto-based setting, saves the picture from being a surefire cure for insomniacs.
11713	5	a	The first thing I did after returning from the screening was take two painkillers for my throbbing headache. A man can only withstand so much shrill shrieking and faux-screwball antics.
11714	2	a	It's a convoluted mess that's too long and stocked with too many characters, all talking in drug-induced non sequiturs. Yet there's something inherently intriguing about it that's tough to shake. 
11715	6	a	Piles on the narrative devices, sonic distortions and gritty images to the point where all you want to do is reach out and wipe away some of the mess so you can decide if there's anything worth seeing.
11716	1	a	Delicious aesthetic, zippy dry dialogue, and some great adventure. Superb voice casting.
11717	2	a	The overwhelmingly earnest Invictus is not your typical sports movie.
11718	6	a	A suspense thriller that is neither suspenseful nor thrilling.
11719	5	a	The storytelling is too straightforward, the humor is not as inventive as we've come to expect from Aardman and the whole soccer situation is confounding and disappointing.
11720	5	a	[B]oth the protagonists are thoroughly mediocre, uninteresting people, and I never figured out why I was supposed to care about the fate of either of them.
11721	4	a	The result is like that bake sale pie: All the ingredients are there, but it's really sloppy and not quite fresh.
11722	8	a	Woefully dull-witted.
11723	3	a	Barnyard can at least hold its head up as a sharply scripted effort that, while assembled from familiar elements, does not feel focus-grouped and committeed to death.
11724	4	a	You may be surprised to find yourself revisiting key scenes for days afterwards.
11725	5	a	A little better than its predecessor, but that's not saying much.
11726	3	a	So, yes, if you watch inherent Vice as a whodunnit, you'll be disappointed -- but if you watch not as a whodunnit but rather as a whahappened, it's a film that's both funny and freaky, a pitch-perfect portrait of a time that never was.
11727	3	a	With minimal gross-out quota, Kasdan's sure-footed approach mixes a teen farce and a morality tale.
11728	3	a	Zealously nasty fun which, surprisingly, ends on something of a note of upbeat grace and familial redemption...
11729	8	a	A few more films like these, and this will be remembered as the beginning of the end of his blockbuster career.
11730	5	a	Alas, little money was left over to fund the screenplay, which is unbelievably bad given the level of talent involved.
11731	4	a	More than a political thriller or a biography, what Chappaquiddick offers a non-complacent drama that delves into the mixed feelings that rattled the insides of the youngest Kennedys. [Full review in Spanish]
11732	4	a	Ralph Breaks the Internet is a candy coated, hard shined brick of postmodernism-a Vitamix smoothie of gags, nostalgia, product placement and Fruity Pebbles.
11733	6	a	It's stylish, if not exactly subtle, and daringly brutal for a Hollywood movie. It's also so uneven and overlong that it may leave non-fans wondering what all the fuss has been about.
11734	1	a	What appears to be a slyly amusing film about an experiment that sounds mostly just goofy turns into a reasonably serious indictment of those conducting the experiment.
11735	3	a	May be a naively simple variation on that other George-Orwell-but it remains a dazzling triumph of creativity and style over financial limitations.
11736	9	a	A bizarre comedy that stretches its central gimmick thinner than watered-down carnival taffy.
11737	4	a	It's all very jolly, in a determinedly in-period way.
11738	5	a	And you thought your parents were embarrassing.
11739	3	a	Even though the novel is one of my favorites; the movie did not leave me disappointed. It left me wanting more, but I didn't walk out dissatisfied with what I was given.
11740	9	a	That the wonderful French actor Jean Reno plays the therapist is a sign that his agent is not doing a good enough job finding him film roles in American movies.
11741	3	a	A great film about a woman running from her life and inadvertantly finding it.
11742	1	a	[It] tells us loud and clear that summer is over and it's okay for grown-ups to go to the movies again.
11743	1	a	A wonderful follow up to the amazing Wreck-It Ralph that will have you laughing nonstop. It's the Disney brand at its finest.
11744	3	a	...a sweet parable about making your own family.
11745	6	a	The movie never delves that deeply into who Gloria Grahame was, aside from a femme fatale slinking across a black-and-white screen.
11746	3	a	A love-it-or-hate-it mainstream romantic comedy in that makes a frill-free connection with its audience, whether that audience wants it or not. There's nothing wrong with something that delivers belly laughs before striking at gut level.
11747	3	a	Reign of Fire may well be the most grim dragon movie ever made -- and it's all the more effective for the filmmakers' decision to play it straight.
11748	3	a	Two Weeks Notice is one of the more shallow romantic comedies of the year, yet also without a doubt one of the most genuinely funny.
11749	0	a	Hulce's goofy performance is pretty fun to watch in and of itself. He is out for sheer partying and joy like the hardest living Rock Star, a dandy fop with a silly laugh and an ego to match.
11750	4	a	Entertaining PG-level thriller anthology.
11751	1	a	That rare thing -- an enjoyable comedy sequel.
11752	1	a	...a thoughtful, mature and earnestly meant work about the essential problem of being human-- the suspicion that this is all there is, and that all our noble ideas about honor and decency, about right and wrong, matter not at all to darkening sky and
11753	3	a	It's a rosy coming-of-age romp that refuses to see the horror even in the severed heads from the guillotine.
11754	5	a	The whodunit-with-terrorist-undertones doesn't test, shock or surprise the audience in any unique way.
11755	1	a	It thunders with the mordant wit, blood-soaked pessimism, and human folly that mark their unique auteurial stamp.
11756	7	a	"Film Stars Don't Die in Liverpool"" is a tawdrier, more tragic, but similarly superficial ""My Week with Marilyn,"" devoted to the dying days of an actress who always lived in Monroe's voluptuous shadow."
11757	3	a	Steven Spielberg's summer adventure is still one of the ultimate movie roller coaster rides. 
11758	4	a	MacFarlane dabbles in exploring deeper themes but more often than not gives way to an endless stream of fart and poop jokes, profanity, and labored racial humor.
11759	8	a	If you love this movie, you're figuratively obeying the title's injunction.
11760	5	a	A dry, talky affair that even Liam Neeson in full glower can't bring to life.
11761	9	a	King's Ransom is a wit-deficient barrage of obnoxious characters and second-hand punchlines.
11762	9	a	A comedy so wan and spiritless that even the ringing cell phones in the theater offer more entertainment.
11763	6	a	Murray does his best to hold up the movie, but there's only so much he can do. Ultimately, his latest fish out of water never makes it back upstream.
11764	4	a	Although younger children will doubtless love it, Hotel for Dogs is too often cute for its own sake to really entertain anyone else.
11765	2	a	The film plays out in a satisfying manner, but with subtlety having served its purpose, it becomes increasingly bombastic about its intent.
11766	6	a	The actors are hamstrung from the very beginning by the Westernized material -- everyone speaks English at all times -- and by the bland direction from Rob Marshall.
11767	4	a	How could lightening strike twice? The result is both a touching elegy to lost youth and frustrating reminder of past glories.
11768	3	a	Terriffic thriller that breaks through its genre.
11769	4	a	Isn't half bad because you sense the filmmakers approached a limited concept with the right amount of fun and dedication in mind.
11770	6	a	It's not enough, and you end up feeling -- despite Jones' dead-on performance -- like you've been cheated. It looks good. It feels right. It gets the job done.... But there's nothing there. Just like Cobb. Maybe that's the point.
11771	4	a	Tragic loss rocks, then inspires team in true sports story. 
11772	3	a	A timeless record of a timeless band.
11773	0	a	Superb acting in an Abby Mann script that seldom descends into bathos.
11774	1	a	The film is often quite funny, deftly walking the thin line between the harrowing and the hilarious.
11775	1	a	As pure craftsmanship, No Country for Old Men is as good as we've ever gotten from Joel and Ethan Coen.
11776	2	a	A hard-edged, darkly funny satire about two Detroit junkies who discover if they want to go straight, they'll have to climb a Mt. Everest of forms, paperwork, office referrals, waiting rooms, rules and regulations.
11777	3	a	Now, Voyager remains a highly narcotic, swoon-inducing romance in the Bette Davis canon.
11778	4	a	Takes itself pretty seriously for a movie that ask the viewer, in the laborious voice-over prologue, to stow all notions of science and logic.
11779	5	a	In this movie, Jarmusch displays an uncanny knack of having absolutely nothing happening on the screen for long periods of time, fading to black, and then coming back with still more nothing.
11780	4	a	Well-acted drama deals with alcohol abuse and more.
11781	2	a	An important and necessary film. [Full Review in Spanish]
11782	4	a	It's not a bad film but I have a feeling that it's too chaotic. It lacks somehow some central gravitas, despite the comedic elements, to bring it all together.
11783	1	a	The movie doesn't break any thematic ground, and in other hands this same material might have made for an insufferable Katherine Heigl vehicle. But Russell and his cast make it sing - and soar, too. 
11784	8	a	The finale is Eastwood at his laziest, allowing news footage to do his job. At least Stone, Skarlatos and Sadler now have the ultimate souvenir of their vacation.
11785	6	a	Imagine Amelie, but starring Clint Eastwood in drag.
11786	4	a	Two thirds of this movie is pretty gosh-darn good and suspenseful. The third act, on the other hand...meh, not so much.
11787	3	a	"How Do You Know"" is a bit slow to get started, and it's nowhere near as funny as ""The Hangover."" But it'll make you smile."
11788	5	a	It's both appallingly self-congratulatory and unconscionable.
11789	3	a	Beresford's direction makes sure that grit and a certain ugliness get equal screen time with the requisite heartwarming qualities.
11790	4	a	It reminds of what Cholodenko is capable--and of the promise that she might get there again.
11791	3	a	It isn't a film fixated on death so much as what comes after and how that affects the living, the type of subject typically treated in films as a theoretical conceit, but one that Eastwood pursues with his trademark straightforward style.
11792	5	a	If you're going to make a comedy about suicide, you'd better make sure the jokes land. There are people out there who could use a laugh.
11793	4	a	This is the kind of romantic comedy you wish you saw more often.
11794	6	a	A gifted director ruining a good book by literalizing what a writer made us visualize for ourselves.
11795	3	a	Deeply felt and deeply affecting.
11796	2	a	"James White"" is about broken people barely holding on while trying to cope with unbearable pain, and the experience can be bruising. But without ever feeling the need to show you hope or redemption, a recognizably real humanity still bleeds through."
11797	2	a	Gory sight gags and intestine eating abound in this must-see movie for fans of the horror genre.
11798	4	a	A saccharine, inoffensive kids movie, which might seem more at home as a made-for-cable affair.
11799	3	a	An extravagantly entertaining ghost story. Hiddleston could be our next Vincent Price.
11800	6	a	A really unnecessary movie, whose purpose is primarily to promote the inevitable home video.
11801	3	a	If you want to know what a good science fiction movie is like, go see Serenity.
11802	1	a	"Wonderful things can come in small packages. And ""Pooh's Heffalump Movie"" is one of them."
11803	4	a	Diary of a Wimpy Kid is no Welcome to the Dollhouse, but as a PG-rated family film navigating the frequent pitfalls and rare triumphs of a sixth grade nothing, it's got a certain charm and wisdom about it.
11804	3	a	An interesting film to stick with and repeatedly reassess what's real and what's just a dream.
11805	6	a	What makes Jason X so much fun is that director James Isaac has his tongue firmly planted in his cheek, ensuring that the film offers as many killer laughs as killings.
11806	3	a	The Imitation Game is simple, but it is also cogent in making the case for its subject's place in history...
11807	2	a	Its storytelling style is as close to the novel form as you'll find on film, both a strengh and a weakness.
11808	6	a	The original film had pathos and humor; this is gratuitous and silly rather than engaging and funny.
11809	3	a	While it's not Russell's best film -- that would be Three Kings -- it's certainly a memorably zany foray into uncharted cinematic territory.
11810	2	a	Its ambitions are modest, its payoffs pleasant enough.
11811	8	a	A hybrid of so many parts that it would be unwieldy even if it were executed very well. But as it happens, it isn't.
11812	2	a	A man who ages backwards will never be able to bond to another person in a truly meaningful way. We can barely be expected to return affection that isn't there.
11813	4	a	"The best animated movies are those that feel timeless. ""Ralph,"" with its right-now storyline, seems already dated, a product of thinking that's five minutes ago."
11814	4	a	I can't recommend it, but it has my undying affection.
11815	7	a	the ending happens at least half an hour later than it should
11816	4	a	Sleek, shallow, but frequently amusing.
11817	6	a	Sometimes you'll laugh with the film, sometimes at it, and sometimes you'll be fumbling for the seatbelt.
11818	4	a	If there's one thing you can be sure of, modern remakes of older movies always have better crashes.
11819	4	a	I feel no pity for Vince Vaughn and Jon Favreau who co-wrote the piece. For their co-stars...we hope this career-killer is worth the paycheck.
11820	3	a	It really is true to say they don't make them like this any more.
11821	4	a	If you were like me and didn't particularly care for the first installment, I don't think this one will completely reverse your opinion.
11822	4	a	Streisand knows her way in front of and behind the camera, but does she have to hog it all? Why cast the magnificent Mandy Patinkin and not let him sing?
11823	2	a	An entertaining little outing, but not something that will stay with me.
11824	4	a	...the latest movie in one of the odder hybrid genres: the cross between the romantic comedy and the gross-out fratboy farce.
11825	3	a	Forget Dirty Harry -- this might be Clint Eastwood's most controversial and divisive film ever.
11826	3	a	Drinking, smoking, grimacing and muttering in a thick German accent, Hoffman owns Bachmann.
11827	2	a	While Bolt doesn't quite contain the same charm and slick storytelling that defines the Pixar films, it is still a mostly enjoyable film that should appeal to all ages.
11828	3	a	A cinematic page-turner.
11829	6	a	The General's Daughter is an overheated thriller populated by actors who far outclass the material.
11830	6	a	These strange looking characters are hard to love. They didn't generate the excitement and enthusiasm that I was hoping for.
11831	2	a	The gore and gross out factors are high but that won't stop the zombie fans from flocking to it like, well, zombies.
11832	6	a	The stream of celebrity cameos cannot make up for a script that is less sharp than its predecessor's.
11833	4	a	You'll feel like you're an unwilling passenger along for a bumpy trip in John Dahl's road rage thriller Joy Ride -- Dahl dresses up this fuel-injected spectacle with silly-minded edge-of-your-seat fury
11834	6	a	Movies used to boast of being 'torn from the headlines.' Now, they're torn from an electronics catalog. Who needs James Bond's Q when you've got Best Buy?
11835	7	a	"If anything, the release of ""The Predator"" is a great excuse to re-watch the original."
11836	4	a	corny but endearing
11837	5	a	The plot's clearly mythic structure may owe more to Disney's strong sense of formula than to the original story. But while the highly predictable narrative falls short, Treasure Planet is truly gorgeous to behold.
11838	5	a	Unfortunately, the first casualty is good acting, which dies a noisy, overly dramatic death.
11839	5	a	Ready Player One is weighed down by so much nostalgia and pop culture references while being devoid of everything else.
11840	6	a	Vardalos apparently never met an ethnic stereotype she didn't like, and she's got a million of them.
11841	5	a	This is How Stella Got Her Groove Back for the Pop-Tart crowd, a wish-fulfillment weepie that narrowly clears Perry's low bar, thanks mostly to Wendi McLendon-Covey and Cocoa Brown
11842	9	a	He was evidently only trying to make fun of horror films, forgetting that horror films, played straight, are now more often funny -- unconsciously to -- than horrible.
11843	3	a	one of those extremely watchable movies that will suck you into a cable tractor beam when you come across it for the next ten years
11844	4	a	...it never rises above the level set by the routine, predictable screenplay...
11845	5	a	It is hard to know what kind of audience this film was made for.
11846	6	a	This is not challenging stuff.
11847	4	a	Not good. Not bad. Just there.
11848	2	a	Wild set-pieces and rueful observations are the stock in trade of this Italian film by one of the modern masters of cinema, Paolo Sorrentino.
11849	4	a	A not-so-bad mindless bit of camp escapism that doesn't try to eclipse its dime-store comic book roots.
11850	0	a	A gorgeous ode to everyone's inner screw-up.
11851	6	a	Quaint but depressing
11852	2	a	Something like a finely-written and -acted soap opera.
11853	4	a	Putting an animal's face to global warming is conceptually smart and would've been more effective if it were applied to other species in other climate zones too.
11854	1	a	As Spielberg vehicles go, Amistad -- part mystery, action thriller, courtroom drama, even culture-clash comedy -- lands between the disturbing lyricism of Schindler's List and the storybook artificiality of The Color Purple.
11855	4	a	Well-acted but clumsy...
11856	4	a	As fare for families with young children, this is a completely pleasant and harmless time-pass, but other viewers should simply pass.
11857	4	a	Step Up movies are known for their trite, formulaic plots and eye-catching dance set-pieces, and this instalment in the series certainly won't disappoint the fans. 
11858	4	a	A Perfect Getaway has its imperfections, but for a thriller of its kind, it's a lively and slick summer escape.
11859	5	a	Obviously, the producers have decided to gear this movie to the very young, but even kids don't like to have their soul food come to them predigested.
11860	3	a	Black Snake Moan finally, is a comedy of faith and faithlessness, in their religious and also their sexual dimensions...A consummate act of jerking our collective chain, and making us love it.
11861	6	a	The film's problems begin with its story, which is constructed with relentless manipulation in mind. It never plays fair with the audience.
11862	3	a	The Imitation Game is a surprisingly brainy war picture about some of the more unexpected heroes behind the scenes.
11863	1	a	Arctic Tale conveys the [environmental] message to kids in an endearing story wrapped around some of the most compelling footage ever captured at the top of the world.
11864	2	a	What struck me most was how cleverly the movie skewers the devious way politicians think and behave, from the shaky relationship our representatives have with facts to their carefully constructed image-building that knows no moral or ethical bounds.
11865	3	a	You could do worse than this and if you have been going to the movies this summer with any regularity, you most likely already have.
11866	5	a	Turner can keep his story to himself. Bening and Bell deserve better. Heck, even Grahame deserves better.
11867	3	a	Tautly acted, fairly sexy and atmospheric.
11868	7	a	"Even Michael Caine's career would have gone nowhere if he had made this version of ""Alfie."
11869	8	a	Something truly special.
11870	4	a	If it doesn't always work as a whole, there are some great individual moments. 
11871	5	a	Entertaining at first, but falls apart once its secret is revealed.
11872	3	a	A delightful and honest teen comedy with a mature soul.
11873	1	a	Please know that it all adds up to a seriously gripping, always thought-provoking narrative for our cautious times. Ironically, it includes one last enormous performance from one of our most trustworthy actors, an unfortunate gift to us all. 
11874	3	a	A uniquely entertaining film.
11875	1	a	It Comes at Night builds, and builds, and builds before unleashing a nightmarish, soul-sickening conclusion that will utterly devastate you if you've grown invested in the film's narrative.
11876	5	a	I personally didn't care when anyone died, I was bored for most of the way, wasn't impressed by its few action scenes.
11877	5	a	Adapting Philip Roth's Pulitzer Prize-winning novel was always going to be a tall order for any director. In first-timer Ewan McGregor's hands it's entirely unwieldy.
11878	3	a	A fascinating public act of career seppuku.
11879	4	a	It ain't big, it ain't clever, but it is... quite funny.
11880	5	a	Cold Creek Manor may not be the worst movie of the stinker season, but it's a strong contender for the dumbest.
11881	4	a	An entertaining film shot with elegance and good taste that... [Full review in Spanish]
11882	4	a	A captivating film... [Full review in Spanish]
11883	5	a	Suffers from a decided lack of creative storytelling.
11884	5	a	If you've spent a week with CBS' prime-time lineup, you've heard this tune a million times.
11885	2	a	Crimson Peak is hardly the house-of-nightmares feature that may be expected. It is a sadder, more pensive and muted film for its indulgences, more wrenching than frightening.
11886	1	a	Incisive, inventive satire, filled with humor, heart and meta moments...
11887	6	a	It looks good, but if this Astro Boy is going to launch a new series, one can only hope the writing the next time out is not as, well... robotic.
11888	3	a	Logan Lucky shows Soderbergh operating modestly with optimum skill. 
11889	3	a	"Nearly everyone who goes to ""Selma"" will know the rough outlines of the story, but DuVernay has made a vigorous and surprising film."
11890	5	a	Schnieder bounces around with limp wrists, wearing tight tummy tops and hip huggers, twirling his hair on his finger and assuming that's enough to sustain laughs...
11891	5	a	The camera is the only star of this film.
11892	4	a	I am giving The Bourne Identity a marginal nod, but if you're looking for a classic-style espionage yarn with complex characters and an engrossing, complicated story, rent Spy Game instead.
11893	5	a	If the creators seem lethally bored with their product, most viewers will find their patience tested, too.
11894	0	a	Bardem is nothing less than the best movie villain since Anthony Hopkins slipped out of Hannibal Lecter's manacles, scary-smart and horrifyingly appealing, and Brolin is nothing short of a revelation.
11895	7	a	It's a sickening exploitation of a historical event.
11896	3	a	Martin Scorsese's long-ripening adaptation ... provides a much-needed corrective, focusing its attention on a man who is constantly plagued by doubts. 
11897	6	a	John Hughes' vision of Dennis is much more menacing than Ketcham's fans and parents of small children might reasonably expect.
11898	6	a	There's little to discover in Paolo Sorrentino's satiric vision of Rome, except perhaps, that some cities just look better than others while entertaining themselves to hell.
11899	8	a	Independent filmmaking grandfather Jim Jarmusch conceives the laziest and most tiring movie of his career with a series of vignettes calculated around celebrities talking over coffee and cigarettes.
11900	1	a	"Project Nim"" is practically irresistible. The story keeps getting odder and richer and more complicated."
11901	6	a	For a bad movie, Flight of the Phoenix is highly entertaining.
11902	3	a	I had such fun spotting both the obvious and subtle references and still missed many, prompting an addition viewing. Anybody want to watch it with me? 
11903	4	a	Those who found Waller's book an outrageously bad read may be gratefully surprised to find less mush in the movie.
11904	4	a	In the context of comedy films, Unaccompanied Minors is probably mediocre at best
11905	5	a	If you've seen the trailer you've seen the best gags.
11906	5	a	Land of the Dead is easily the worst of Romero's four zombie movies, and clearly should have never been made.
11907	3	a	Inherent Vice does gets over-entangled, but, despite the pot haze, a credible plot emerges and Anderson chalks up another triumph.
11908	1	a	Both Kidder and Reeve shine.
11909	6	a	I expect this movie to make a lot of money at the box office, spent by fans eager to see still more cool ways for hot young characters to be slaughtered. My review will not be read by any of these people. They know what they enjoy.
11910	5	a	It's all surface and formula.
11911	1	a	The film offers no grand statements, just a clever idea and exceptional cast.
11912	3	a	The film, ambitious if flawed, also is lyrical and melancholy as it tells the story of a man aging backward.
11913	6	a	Tedious but well-photographed atmospheric jazz pic from the Prohibition era.
11914	9	a	No chemistry, no cool, no compelling characters, no air of urgency. Just a very average crime caper which fails to entertain the viewer on a gut, cerebral or superficial level. Not exactly your father's Miami Vice.
11915	4	a	The filmmakers take a great yarn and reduce it to a good one.
11916	2	a	"Nebraska,"" it turns out, isn't as bleak as it first looks."
11917	5	a	It's as if the film, like many of its characters, is in a constant state of a drug-addled high, unable to remain focused or make sense of anything that's going on.
11918	4	a	Director Nimod Antal's stripped-down genre exercise -- there's not even a hint of a romantic subplot -- is unremarkable but efficient.
11919	1	a	Succinctly demonstrates we've both come a long way and have a long way to go.
11920	3	a	Refreshing in its lack of pomp and circumstance, a movie that exists to be a movie and nothing bigger.
11921	3	a	A sweet, kooky doco-drama that has plenty of heart, albeit a paper one.
11922	0	a	Like its hero, extraordinary in every way. [Blu-Ray review]
11923	3	a	Humans-vs.-Dragons apocalyptic action film is a blast of pulpy, pop-mythic fun.
11924	3	a	Gallo also wrote a pretty funny screenplay filled with interesting characters, idiosyncrasies galore, and a decent romance between two very odd lead characters.
11925	4	a	I value Haynes as an artist, but his art isn't revelatory or emotional; it signifies feelings rather than sharing them.
11926	4	a	Solid, sadistic Stiller fare.
11927	4	a	Look through the haze of weed and the raunchy jokes and you'll see a movie that's grown up with its audience, its subject matter and its subjects--and gotten even funnier in the process.
11928	2	a	This is surprisingly funny - it has a great opening and closing montage; both quickly establish the story and mood of the movie... Will Smith swept us all off our feet.
11929	1	a	Though the maneuvering almost descends into tedium at times, Russell has created a dense and operatic portrait in which nothing is as it seems.
11930	4	a	While the film rarely imparts a true sense of messy everyday feelings and the strife of real life, the fine actors take your mind off the shortcomings.
11931	4	a	A bonafide classic. Walken is terrific
11932	5	a	A comedy clinker set in the old Wild West. 
11933	2	a	...where We Bought A Zoo earns its stripes is in the process of getting all of its characters to relate to and accept each other. 
11934	2	a	[Grant] once again demonstrates himself to be the movies' unrivaled master of sophisticated verbal comedy.
11935	4	a	Emerging from the Job-like endurance test of this film's unrelenting horror, it's impossible not to be moved by its visceral impact ...
11936	5	a	Ms. Jolie tries her best to be sweet, brisk, and breezy, but the film's leaden pace and hackneyed plot won't allow her to be much more than a cardboard spectator...
11937	0	a	This is the stuff of Dickens, told on the scale of Blade Runner and Brazil, with the madcap spirit of The Great Muppet Caper.
11938	5	a	A barely serviceable update, The Predator is unlikely to succeed in creating a new generation of fans.
11939	6	a	Hilarious? No. But will you hate your kids for begging to see it? Nooooo.
11940	0	a	This remarkably entertaining and meaty motion picture is all eye candy and goofy entertainment for children, but underneath lies a biting denunciation on a number of contemporary topics.
11941	3	a	It's a rare movie that knows when to move and when to stay still. Call Me By Your Name ... is just such a film, lazy as a late-afternoon dragonfly one moment, rash and rushed as young love the next.
11942	2	a	The story is shamelessly derivative, but you won't mind much because it's so gentle and warm-hearted.
11943	4	a	Better than average Elvis vehicle.
11944	5	a	It's a promising premise that soon gets stuck in a cul-de-sac.
11945	3	a	Firefly finally has the triumphant finale fans longed for: the excitingly tense, often surprising and even more frequently comical Serenity. Fans will rejoice.
11946	4	a	Succeeds in entertaining the audience, but diminishes the overall power of the social critique Ellis had in mind.
11947	0	a	An astonishingly imaginative, poignant, genre-defying tale of teen love, insanity and time travel.
11948	2	a	The film's an effective, poignant tribute to not only Marie Colvin, but also by every journalist who's ever risked their life or laid everything on the line to cover a story.
11949	3	a	Futurism meets film noir in the most satisfying S-F picture of its day.
11950	6	a	The comedy, as expected, is scattershot.
11951	6	a	Loud, technically proficient, very expensive, and pretty much soulless.
11952	1	a	The Nightmare Before Christmas has something to offer just about everyone.
11953	6	a	Not Easily Broken is well-acted and involving, though this relationship drama may put some people off with its overt sentimentality and moralizing.
11954	1	a	A space spectacle resonant with witty dialogue, accessible characters and kaleidoscopic action.
11955	7	a	Somehow the knowledge that you are three degrees of separation from Dabney Coleman and a computer called W.O.P.R. transforms trite claptrap into the words of the Bard himself.
11956	0	a	A love letter to Firefly fans, an open invitation to everyone else
11957	1	a	Deeper than mere mimicry...
11958	3	a	Julianne Moore is devastatingly good, charting Alice's decline with subtlety and grace. It's just a slight disappointment that her Oscar-worthy performance is not just the crux of Still Alice, but also the film's entirety.
11959	5	a	It was made strictly by and for Civil War buffs who insist that every pious speech and every skirmish is worthy of filming, even if the end result suffers from serious battle fatigue.
11960	9	a	Snakes on a Plane has an irresistible title and an impressive promotional campaign -- but pitches aren't plots, and marketing isn't moviemaking.
11961	5	a	Eager to please and easy on the eyes, The Kings of Summer sails right down the middle, safely tacking between sitcom setups and grandiose MGMT-scored montages without forming its own distinctive feel.
11962	4	a	Visually dazzling but thematically mediocre.
11963	3	a	In the race to achieve unadulterated fourth-wall breakage, Tim and Eric's Billion Dollar Movie is the new pack leader.
11964	3	a	The genuine success of The Infiltrator comes from the fact that Cranston seems to hate it, that his every second is full of dread and terror, and he can't wait for it to be over. And so he makes everyone in the audience a nervous wreck.
11965	2	a	I can't believe I'm going to say it, but this film is as busy as a bee.
11966	6	a	A more appropriate title for Stay would have been Go.
11967	4	a	Audiences may get twitchy during some of the more obvious moments, but they'll look back on the film with a smile.
11968	1	a	An intelligent, engaging comedy-drama that will have audiences tapping their toes and running off to buy the soundtrack.
11969	6	a	What we get is the filmic equivalent of a smiley face. But enthusiasm and sincerity don't make the hard questions go away.
11970	3	a	...an entertaining yet somewhat disappointing effort from Fincher.
11971	2	a	Sweetly sincere and sensitive, it's a timely, yet different coming-of-age story.
11972	6	a	A-by-the-numbers action film retrofitted as a sci-fi work of art.
11973	3	a	A terrific teen comedy with the traditional feel of John Hughes's Sixteen Candles and Pretty in Pink.
11974	5	a	Saccharine feel-good mainstream comedy geared to the Lowest Common Denominator.
11975	4	a	It adheres to all the genre conventions and, although not a classic, is engaging and enjoyable.
11976	6	a	Noble, even interesting but also long and ultimately flawed experiment.
11977	2	a	Hulk like 'Expendables.' It SMASH. Guns go BANG-BANG. Things go BOOM. Fire EVERYWHERE. Cars crash and make even MORE FIRE. HA-HA-HA. Hulk no like Rourke, though. Rourke NUTS.
11978	4	a	Listen, it could have been a lot worse.
11979	4	a	...it's not tense enough, realistic enough, or exciting enough to lift it much beyond the ordinary.
11980	5	a	full review at Movies for the Masses
11981	4	a	As it is, I admire the brilliance of the majority of this picture to no-end; it's just that pesky literal ending I walked out wanting to declare war on.
11982	1	a	It could almost be accused of 'middle-class whining' -- something Linney's character frets about -- if not for its sharply observant conversations and strikingly personal performances.
11983	5	a	Stillborn
11984	3	a	A thrilling adventure full of imagination and humor. It's the best animated film of the season. You don't have to be a kid to enjoy it. 
11985	3	a	That you feel sympathy -- and a kinship -- to these searchers makes Huckabees something you'll gladly give your heart to.
11986	5	a	Eventually you're just rooting for Gary and Brooke to get the whole ordeal over with, as much for the audience's sake as for their own.
11987	6	a	A gorgeous but plodding period piece.
11988	4	a	If the praise seems faint, it's nevertheless praise -- this Flight of the Phoenix may not soar, but it manages to get itself airborne. 
11989	3	a	While Moretti is as secular as the character he plays in the film, he gives us a papal portrait that's nuanced and counterintuitive; we're used to the humanity of popes evinced as Borgian lust and avarice, not as self-doubt and humility.
11990	10	a	A woozy, pretentious would-be thriller that aims to be mind-bending but instead is patience-trying.
11991	4	a	Stylish Almodovar drama is too mature for teens.
11992	5	a	Fincher takes repeated stabs at creating depth but seldom draws blood in attempting to flesh out characters that just aren't that interesting. 
11993	4	a	Yet in trying to bring the story to a powerful climax, Schrader lets things get too hectic and surreal, a final psychedelic scene undoing much of the film's hard work.
11994	4	a	It may or may not come as a surprise, but Will Smith is out-acted by the robots.
11995	9	a	Quickly goes from fun to offensive.
11996	9	a	Because Bram Stoker's Dracula was published seven years prior to the events of She Creature, Angus and his merry crew have no excuse for not foreseeing their inevitable fates.
11997	6	a	The relationship between Travis and Myers is boring; too bad the whole film wasn't about the Scottish family. They deserve their own picture.
11998	1	a	... a film that explores the boundaries and responsibilities of a relationship free of the judgment that outsiders would inevitably impose upon it.
11999	5	a	[Sean] McNamara loses the opportunity to make a film of truly epic proportions by adding a double dose of molasses to a story that by its very nature was sweet enough. [Full Review in Spanish] 
12000	6	a	Director Steven Quale stages the death scenes with intermittently effective black humour to juice up a premise that, essentially, has all the suspense of watching the line at an abattoir.
12001	3	a	Still a ripsnorting yarn with lashings of sex and violence that hasn't aged a day.
12002	4	a	This tale of a marriage of convenience charms and amuses with strong comedic performances with a great script and some beautifully shot sequences.
12003	6	a	It takes a while for Country Strong to make up its mind what it wants to be about, and it takes even longer for it to figure out how to get there as the conclusion drags on and on, searching for a point.
12004	1	a	The movie's performances have a simplicity and accuracy that is always convincing.
12005	6	a	If you like scenes of characters sticking hands down their pants, this is the film for you.
12006	2	a	May not be the deepest film around, but the sharp writing, an able cast and sensitive direction make it an engaging one.
12007	4	a	A successful entry in the series, and a darn good film on its own.
12008	1	a	I would never do what Christopher McCandless did, and yet I found Into the Wild to be incredibly inspiring.
12009	3	a	Russell's aping is still a knockout, with enough razzle-dazzle style and propulsive humor to make it one of the most casually fun movies of the year.
12010	4	a	Adults we are going to meet again with that child we were, but more than anything to want to get away from the one who carries the weight of the title of the film.
12011	3	a	The schemes that Wong uses to dispatch these mostly attractive characters are not only ingenious: they provide some of the comic tongue-in-cheek moments that are part and parcel of the genre.
12012	4	a	It's not a great film, but let's face it: Considering the source, this is as good as it was ever going to get.
12013	3	a	One of those rare movies that I know I shouldn't like, but... I cannot help but enjoy it.
12014	6	a	This is an average movie, and not what Slient Hill, a standout, resonant game series, deserves.
12015	6	a	Demerits for the dull execution.
12016	1	a	...a completely new experience for the audience and the film's characters, and virtually, one of the best sequels that has ever come along in the past decade.
12017	1	a	Eastwood has transformed the slow burn he's shown in so many of his movies in the past and brought it to every character in this movie, and to this top-notch film.
12018	2	a	Granted, nothing here is going to go down in history as a horror classic. But as far as dead-teen flicks go, this is one pretty lively affair.
12019	0	a	"In an era of comic-book movies, ""Selma"" is an impressive reminder of the real-life struggle for human dignity."
12020	3	a	A surprisingly nimble and low-key treatment of a story that could have easily be blown up into a portentous drag
12021	4	a	The potential here is obvious, but never realized.
12022	3	a	The late Chris Farley's funniest work
12023	3	a	A riveting horror-thriller that should do for hiking in Hawaii what Hostel did for backpacking in Slovakia.
12024	4	a	Nem mesmo o excepcional elenco consegue levar o espectador a conhecer um pouco melhor aqueles personagens. Ainda assim, o filme tem seus momentos.
12025	2	a	It sucks you into its alluring story as if you were a mark.
12026	5	a	If anything, the whole thing reeks of nothing more than a second rate pilot for a bad sitcom.
12027	3	a	...a meditation on the nature of celebrity and the superstitious need of thwarted little men to smash their idols.
12028	5	a	Lee displays only glimmers of the cartoonish, gonzo sensibility that once made him seem like an interesting talent. In its place is strained seriousness and a butt-ugly digital palette of tan and sand.
12029	1	a	It's a surprising performance from Forte, tasked with much of the heavy lifting opposite a tight-lipped Dern.
12030	7	a	Probably Clint Eastwood should not make sentimentalized, epical films about wish fulfillment. But there's Hereafter. It's a film that might make Clint's mentor the late Don Siegel look away.
12031	4	a	For the most part, director Adam Shankman keeps the mayhem comprehensible.
12032	2	a	There's a bit of ballast in this romcom that is quite satisfying.
12033	9	a	It says something when a two-year-old is the most mature character in the film.
12034	5	a	Sadly for us though, Favreau and Vaughn are likely to continue their profitable relationship for some time to come.
12035	4	a	The performances are fine, but this feels like a companion piece to 'When We Were Kings' rather than a work that can stand on its own...
12036	3	a	No one will ever accuse William Friedkin of mellowing with age
12037	4	a	While there's much to admire in this technical push, it's only affecting in fits. 
12038	9	a	Brickbat socialism in a dimwit populist entertainment. . . The film is about as subtle as a dump truck. 
12039	9	a	[A] dismal and dull film ...
12040	3	a	A haunting, ambitious but ultimately flawed film that treads some of the same somber moral territory director Clint Eastwood explored in Unforgiven.
12041	1	a	A moving tribute to an extraordinary man.
12042	9	a	Anderson apparently doesn't understand how to scare an audience.
12043	4	a	A nightmare within a nightmare
12044	4	a	As Grahame, Bening is boldly unglamorous, unravelling from insecurity and illness.
12045	7	a	Taking Woodstock is homogenized mud. Director Ang Lee slides all over the place. He takes away all the sharp edges; what is left is pretty much a mess.
12046	5	a	Heed my warning: Unless you guys stop going en masse to movies like the first Cheaper by the Dozen, genuinely funny people like Hunt, Martin and Levy will forever be forced to pay their heating bills doing bland franchise fillers like this.
12047	0	a	Simply one of the most ravishing films ever made, luminous in a way that no other movie has been.
12048	3	a	Menashe is a deeply felt and absorbing Yiddish-language drama about New York Hasidic Jews.
12049	1	a	"For much of its brisk running time, ""It Comes at Night"" teeters between delicious atmosphere and almost unbearable tension."
12050	6	a	Making this your kids' first Pooh experience would be like weaning them on New Coke.
12051	4	a	A somewhat exciting new film from the Ivory Coast that breaks the lame American cinematic slavery mold.
12052	9	a	Technically, the film is a compendium of stale MTV gimmicks -- dry ice, stylized sets. It's a neo-Expressionist tempest in a teapot.
12053	4	a	Seagal's best.
12054	3	a	How many actions stars does it take to get audiences into theaters? THIS many.
12055	6	a	Deteriorates into a silly farce that lands somewhere between Kubrick's Eyes Wide Shut and Guccione's Caligula.
12056	3	a	One of the better bonds, but it isn't as good as Daniel Craig's first outing.
12057	9	a	The worst kind of movie -- one with no direction, no identity, and above all no heart.
12058	3	a	A compelling, if imperfect, motion picture.
12059	4	a	For the most part, BandSlam is a decent knockoff. The script is quippy and smart. Connell and Hudgens are both appealing.
12060	3	a	Hailee Steinfeld lifts this likeable offering from first-time writer-director Kelly Fremon Craig towards the higher slopes of the high-school, rite-of-passage genre pile.
12061	8	a	Only an amusing cameo by David Bowie enlivens things, but he's onscreen for just about two minutes at the end.
12062	5	a	"William Blake may have once stated ""The road to excess leads to the palace of wisdom"" but I'm guessing that if he ever had the opportunity to see the ""Crank"" films, he might have had second thoughts about that."
12063	3	a	Although the new film comes with a superior pedigree, it's just about equal in terms of quality with its earlier-in-theaters rival.
12064	2	a	No-nonsense B crime thriller.
12065	8	a	What do you expect from the man who not only directed Glitter, but spent an entire DVD commentary track defending the film?
12066	9	a	"John Carter"" is a huge bore."
12067	4	a	The pic becomes too bent out of shape by so many kooks sharing the spotlight.
12068	3	a	'Nebraska' works for a lot of reasons, but most of it has to do with the performances.
12069	3	a	I had a good giggle watching Ghostbusters again, and I recommend checking it out for an evening of turn-your-brain-off entertainment.
12070	5	a	Don't let Identity Thief steal two hours of your life. 
12071	10	a	Plainly sick and grotesque, existing only to shock or nauseate an audience with hideous images, stale performances, lifeless photography, and painfully vile actions.
12072	4	a	[An] absorbing experience.
12073	4	a	It's never less than entertaining and the chemistry between our two leads, whatever their personal circumstances, really holds things together.
12074	0	a	And boy howdy, does that dialogue howl like a basset hound pup who's just been yanked from his momma.
12075	0	a	With some of the sharpest dialogue ever cut in Hollywood, only on the most superficial level is this a movie about gossip and publicity. We're talking show business. We're talking America. We're talking cast-iron classic.
12076	6	a	It is only because of Wilson's charm that this movie manages to entertain as much as it does, which is just barely enough.
12077	3	a	A savvy riff on our current cultural anxieties.
12078	0	a	An amazing accomplishment. George Miller brings the same approach to this sequel as he did with the Mad Max trilogy: Don't re-make, re-invent. A work of genius.
12079	3	a	The purple, elephant-like creature sports a sweet little British accent and a contagious laugh. He more than justifies his presence.
12080	6	a	Though Coffee and Cigarettes provokes the occasional buzz, it is really just a respite from any serious business [Jarmusch] may have planned, or may be putting off.
12081	5	a	... the final result, while passable enough, is no particular treat ... 
12082	3	a	Has a disarming quality to it, depicting a romance not as torrid waves of drama but as something that is born awkward and steadily gains its holding.
12083	3	a	It's one randomly diverting flourish after the next as Bodi makes the journey from his cloistered home to the big city and potential ax-shredding stardom.
12084	5	a	Botched promise abounds, starting with the wasted potential of John Cusack's Roman and Jackie Chan's Chinese guard uniting against Brody's evil Tiberius.
12085	4	a	This is a movie about a self-obsessed woman who seems to learn that the wisdom of the ancients is that she should be even more self-obsessed. 
12086	1	a	Wickedly funny, sick, insightful, depressing, dirty, unjudging, awesomely acted and brilliant.
12087	2	a	If you enjoyed Remember the Titans and don't mind sitting through a fairly predictable movie with a sound message of hope, redemption, faith and second chances, I suspect that you will be taken by this film as well.
12088	1	a	Doesn't have the daring lunacy of Chuck and Buck... Yet it gets closer to the troubled, lonely soul of its main character.
12089	4	a	It's not a classic and doesn't have all the tension it maybe should have. It's basically distracting Hollywood thriller fluff that is enjoyable enough in the right mood.
12090	3	a	Will make some people uncomfortable, but for many others it will be a giddily guilty pleasure.
12091	4	a	If pure action is your game, this House is your home.
12092	2	a	Miami Vice exudes the kind of gritty life we expect, so much so that you might argue that neither Crockett nor Tubbs deserves to be called a main character; Mann reserves that role for crime itself.
12093	3	a	The Incredibles is Spy Kids by way of the Jetsons, with that reliable Pixar blend of intelligence and beautiful craftsmanship.
12094	3	a	Your pre-tweens and tweens will love Bolt, though; the good news is that there's an excellent chance you'll like it, too.
12095	3	a	Sure, the plot, dialogue and acting are as silly as usual. But buoyed by a sparkling Rio setting and an awesomely staged third-act action setpiece, Fast Five is the series' best outing since the original. 
12096	9	a	The Road Chip is bad, and anyone who cashed a check because of it should feel bad.
12097	8	a	Black Nativity is a cut-rate musical melodrama that grafts overreaching references to black culture onto a facile family-values narrative.
12098	6	a	It's scary to think of how much better this king of the jungle could've been had it possessed the sharp teeth of its animal namesake and took a serious bite out of the plump themes of family greed, lost love and misspent youth.
12099	3	a	Films like this don't allow you to anticipate what's coming, deciding to instead sneak into your body and astound you with the widest range of emotions
12100	1	a	One of the most visually impressive American films ever made, Days of Heaven fulfilled the promise that Terrence Malick had shown in Badlands
12101	3	a	Lee's larkiest film by far, Taking Woodstock features faces familiar and fresh.
12102	3	a	Combines thrilling animated action with genuine wit and character development.
12103	4	a	Lacks imagination.
12104	3	a	A lovely example of TV sci-fi doing what it does best, and with an amount of money that no TV sci-fi ever had at its disposal.
12105	9	a	Days is a watered-down, lightweight version of War of the Roses made for people who still think Friends is funny.
12106	4	a	Despite its slickness, virility, occasional humor and, if it may be repeated, authentic professional approach, it is well-made but awfully familiar fare.
12107	0	a	It takes a world-class storyteller and a great yarn to rivet your attention for nearly three hours. This very classy, old-school movie -- employing cutting-edge technology that will make your eyes pop -- did it for me.
12108	3	a	Theron's performance is a success, but it has the unfortunate side effect of overshadowing the rest of the movie.
12109	2	a	Fincher synthesizes the best of both of his two previous serial killer movies, but combines them with a maturity that shouldn't be mistaken for boredom with the material. 
12110	4	a	Give me loose, idiosyncratic, comic meandering over stone-faced business-as-usual any day. It isn't the movie you're expecting, but it's got its authors' grubby handprints all over it.
12111	3	a	Such an appealing heroine makes it easy for anyone, existing fan or not, to be entertained by this yarn.
12112	0	a	A film with the epic scope of a crowd-pleaser but the subtlety of an introspective character study, The Curious Case of Benjamin Button is at once intimate and sweeping, and one of the year's very best films.
12113	4	a	If you measure a comedy by how many times you laughed, Seth MacFarlane's A Million Ways to Die in the West, at least for me, is a middling success.
12114	9	a	A disaster, lurching awkwardly from one tone to another, way too long with too many characters, and seriously short on laughs all the while. 
12115	3	a	keeps the danger and sadness at bay, instead giving us two fairly developed kid characters
12116	3	a	A good general rule is that if one performance is good, credit the actor. But if everyone in the movie is doing excellent work, this is no coincidence. This is the product of superior direction.
12117	1	a	Zhang proves that Hero was no accident with House of Flying Daggers, another Chinese period piece resplendent with a dazzling palette and soaring, ambitious fight sequences.
12118	3	a	The film's nameless South American pit-stop brings to mind the same ambient, allegorical landscapes of Matewan devastated by the specters of imperialism.
12119	2	a	Adams is truly magical. She brews up her most transfixing expressions when words fail her.
12120	6	a	Fans will be pleased enough with the slapstick and musical offerings here. Rebel Wilson, again, owns the film with her pleasantly abrasive wit, her broad appeal spiced by the fact that this is her first movie to come out after her libel case victory. 
12121	1	a	Fassbender and Vikander are both powerful in their roles, and even in a comparatively small amount of screen time, Weisz is commanding.
12122	3	a	Good acting and plenty to think about, but a better director than Mike Binder would have made a better film.
12123	4	a	Feig's sympathies toward young misfits are still thankfully evident, but the mature, realistic approach that made 'Freaks and Geeks' so refreshing is missing here.
12124	6	a	"Romantics will be loyal to this movie, but they are after all ""romantics."
12125	1	a	The Curious Case of Benjamin Button is that rare thing: a truly magical movie.
12126	6	a	It has its strengths, but it's clunky, awkward, and repetitive every step of the way.
12127	6	a	Done in by a weak script.
12128	4	a	Eminem is such a commanding visual presence, diversely eloquent of patience, ire, and weariness, that his silent poses and solitary interludes become many of the film's most effective scenes.
12129	3	a	It's an entertaining film, but it's certainly no masterpieceand doesn't really stand up to the year's other offerings.
12130	6	a	You feel as if you're being smothered in cotton candy by a director obsessed with infantility and who cannot bear to face the reality of childhood.
12131	5	a	As an antidote to the sugar, what we need now is a grumpy film called Letters to Lady Macbeth, in which malcontents leave rage-filled missives in the battlements of Glamis Castle.
12132	3	a	If The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey is any indicator of things to come, this trilogy could be every bit as wondrous and exciting as the one that preceded it.
12133	3	a	This new, highly polished upgrade is a nice gift for science fiction fans.
12134	3	a	Even if it doesn't raise the stakes of the genre, there's enough potential to turn this funny and smartly written caper into another entertaining Soderbergh franchise.
12135	7	a	Mall cops everywhere should sue. The movie is trash.
12136	3	a	Danny Boyle's long-awaited follow-up gets the tone exactly right, capturing the spirit of the original and making the collective nostalgia an integral part. 
12137	5	a	"Valkyrie"" is nowhere near the outright bomb that many assumed that it would be. That said, it should be noted that the film is also nowhere near the gripping cinematic experience that it should have been given the subject matter."
12138	4	a	Something of a mess that moves jarringly from one genre to another, but though it never really comes together, it's also weirdly entertaining.
12139	9	a	This one is absolutely pricless in its awfulness.
12140	3	a	Almost everyone has lively things to say, the topics usually centering on the Kevin Smith triumvirate of sex, comics, and movies.
12141	6	a	Reign of Fire comes across as too concerned with traditional crowd-pleasing to explore its full potential for camp.
12142	4	a	A strange current of sympathy and compassion for those involved drives the political principals of the film. [Full Review in Spanish] 
12143	3	a	Miller gets old and used up before our eyes, and we not only see it, we see what it means to experience it. This is a movie about power, and its spectacle is that of a woman losing all of it.
12144	3	a	I Heart Huckabees combines slapstick humour, a witty, off-the-wall script and a collection of wonderful performances from its superb ensemble cast.
12145	3	a	A flawed but engaging film, Mystic River succeeds through the sheer weight of talent involved.
12146	4	a	Visually rather stunning, but ultimately a handsome-looking bore, the true creativity would have been to hide Treasure Planet entirely and completely reimagine it.
12147	0	a	Clint Eastwood's Hereafter considers the idea of an afterlife with tenderness, beauty and a gentle tact.
12148	6	a	Without context and reason to care, I never understood why I was lurking about here the first place.
12149	5	a	The schmaltz is laid on thick, but kids love this sort of stuff and, refreshingly, the dog bits are done the old-fashioned, fun way: with animal trainers rather than CGI.
12150	1	a	Skyfall can take its place alongside From Russia with Love, Goldfinger, and On Her Majesty's Secret Service as the best Bond can offer.
12151	3	a	The staging is mostly spot-on, especially when the father and son visit some cousins who can barely muster a moment's attention for their long-lost relatives before their eyes return to their television set.
12152	2	a	Contains enough belly-laughs and sly jokes to become one of the bigger crowd-pleasers of the fall.
12153	3	a	Filled with light-hearted fancy and a dazzling cast, Woody Allen's latest film is a magical stroll through a magnificent city
12154	4	a	Adventurous viewers will find this unusual genre hybrid an intriguing experience.
12155	1	a	The Chicago riots may have been our parents' history, but this is not our parents' documentary.
12156	5	a	Couples Retreat comes across as a movie that was made... because it was felt that if the right buttons were pushed, this might make money.
12157	4	a	Likeable and engaging despite its overly long running time, sloppy screenplay and rambling structure.
12158	6	a	Basic-cable production values and an exceedingly generic story... It's harmless, but it's at the low end of tolerable as far as vapid teen apocalypse adventures go.
12159	1	a	The build-up gains slow momentum but once it finds its rhythm Rev Road is positively devastating
12160	3	a	The Jewish Steven Spielberg has now made two stirring films on Black History and one on Jewish History. If he can manage to reconcile tensions between those two communities he will be deserving of more than Oscars.
12161	2	a	Simon and his friends are likeable kids and their romantic problems are affectionately explored.
12162	4	a	How engrossing you find it still depends on how long you are entranced by the pretty pictures.
12163	9	a	The shenanigans that first-time screenwriter Dana Cox concocts from this lame scenario fluctuate from stupid to lazy and back to dull
12164	3	a	"The slickest, coolest assassin flick since ""The Professional."
12165	2	a	Bright Star is, indeed, a bright star.
12166	2	a	Miss West gives a highly amusing performance.
12167	4	a	"Whether you want to spend time with ""James White"" depends on your tolerance for yet another film about how hard it is for guys who just feel too much."
12168	4	a	As an opportunity for giant lunkheads to knock each other around and blow things up, The Expendables is considerably more fun than the last Transformers movie.
12169	3	a	If your senses haven't been dulled by slasher films and gorefests, if you're a connoisseur of psychological horror, this is your ticket.
12170	4	a	Without the remarkably fascinating metamorphosis of Charlize Theron into a hideous troglodyte, this movie could've been quite the monster.
12171	1	a	Colorful and witty...the mixture of action and humor proves as irresistible as ever.
12172	4	a	This story of literal and figurative female sexual repression feels curiously unfinished, its many layers rather decorously undisturbed.
12173	4	a	Hathaway is too good an actress not to deliver more than just a grand star turn and she's able to carry the story of Austen's.
12174	2	a	In the end it's worth a look, but you might wish you had some of Wendy's happy pills that she ripped off from her father's dead girlfriend.
12175	4	a	The Nightmare Before Christmas is a veritable bounty of visual delights.
12176	7	a	[Tom] Hanks and his co-writer Nia Vardaloshave taken a promising premise and forced it into the confines of a generic romantic comedy template. 
12177	1	a	Artist a lovingly rendered homage.
12178	4	a	A fine feature debut for director Laurence Dunmore, The Libertine is more of a calling card for his future work than a fully rounded triumph in its own right.
12179	0	a	"First Reformed,"" is the face of Hawke, which miraculously never gets consumed by the hellfire all around. "
12180	0	a	It just might be one of those intriguing films that requires an acquired taste.
12181	1	a	It's an original, and what it does best is show how strangers can become friends, and friends can become like family.
12182	2	a	Sumptuous and exotic, this Asian Cinderella story unveils an ancient, refined tradition - albeit at a sluggish pace - and stars three exquisite actresses.
12183	5	a	If you have absolutely nothing else to do, and you can see it for free, with little hassle, you just might get Fockersized.
12184	2	a	Shamir's breezy manner and casual approach encourage people to speak candidly, and their comments about Jews are shocking -- horrendous, really, but sometimes surprisingly funny.
12185	1	a	Though Marsh's Errol Morris-like style can get glib, it never gets boring.
12186	8	a	A debacle that suggests there's nothing like some good old-fashioned American weaponry to solve the world's problems.
12187	7	a	I realize it's bad manners to be flip about a movie that emblazons its heart on its sleeve. But Hereafter, soggy with portentous uplift, invites that response.
12188	4	a	I laughed a little, but in the back of my mind I was secretly planning out how soon I'd be able to get back to the theater to see The Two Towers again.
12189	1	a	Theron doesn't 'play' Wuornos as much as inhabit her - with pity, volcanic anger, confusion, occasional euphoria and mostly, impenetrable sadness.
12190	6	a	If Basic Instinct achieves nothing else, it will replace Caligula as Bob Guccione's favorite movie.
12191	5	a	It's never more than ridiculous popcorn fun, but the fun is thin on the ground.
12192	5	a	The hilarious thought of stunned Team Edward devotees scratching their heads at this mystifying David Cronenberg movie is about all there is to get you through it.
12193	2	a	It's a very clever story, intriguingly written and superbly played by its cast, even as it crosses a couple of lines and gets rather too violent.
12194	9	a	Despite reliable work from Dillon and Fishburne, Armored is something of a disappointment, thanks to a dull script and a lacklustre leading performance from Short.
12195	5	a	King's Secret Window, Secret Garden is the kind of story that defies adaptation.
12196	2	a	It's harsh, but it's sweetened by Toby -- he's not a real boy, but he's a classic hero.
12197	4	a	Plaza and Duplass are enormously watchable, and there's a sweet sadness in the movie's focus on lost dreams and missed chances, and the truism that we all long for a time machine every once in a while.
12198	5	a	"If they remade ""It's A Wonderful Life,"" they could make it about Spielberg being shown what American cinema would be like if he never lived - they'd show him this movie."
12199	4	a	...well-acted but unadventurous in its allegorical depiction of temptation and personal growth.
12200	4	a	Bardem proves once again, as he has in movies' past that he is one of the most talented actors that can be called upon time and time again in the Spanish film world...
12201	1	a	Coppola reigns in Murray's usual sarcastic schtick and as a result he delivers a truly wonderful performance that is warm, understated and charming.
12202	5	a	It's not a film about a man's struggle with potential paralysis, but when the rest of the feature plays so blandly and predictably, perhaps it should've been.
12203	9	a	Who needs an intriguing story line when an everyday piece of equipment can be used to splatter someone's head like a festering zit?
12204	3	a	Shot for shot, Memoirs of a Geisha is one of the most beautiful movies in years, with due credit to Don Beebe's widescreen camera work, John Myhre's meticulous production design and Colleen Atwood's opulent costumes.
12205	6	a	"Tonally and creatively messy, and filled with entirely too much shouting. In the case of ""The Angriest Man in Brooklyn,"" less would have been much, much more."
12206	5	a	A metaphysical film that has no existential thoughts in its head.
12207	3	a	Intense.
12208	4	a	The second half is where it becomes more interesting, and a greater focus on this part of the story would have made for less of a viewing slog.
12209	6	a	Humanity is dwarfed by landscape, but the effect is more pictorial than revealing.
12210	3	a	Actually admits that human beings think about sex. A lot.
12211	0	a	Takes the heartland - a stretch of America that Hollywood flatters as the place where Reese Witherspoon can find herself - and strips the Norman Rockwell off it like cheap aluminum siding.
12212	3	a	There's plenty to like ...
12213	4	a	The film can't quite summon the anguish to go full Taxi Driver - the conclusion balks right at the edge of the abyss - but Schrader's images have never been crisper, and Hawke is transfixing.
12214	6	a	There are plenty of no-budget movies worthy of grassroots movements. 'Fanboys,' which comes with a built-in fan base only by virtue of its connection to a universe George Lucas created, isn't one of them.
12215	0	a	The purely visual filmmaking, accompanied by Ludovic Bource's musical score, is an absolute delight.
12216	3	a	Wristcutters: A Love Story has an offbeat, absurdist charm that turns a potentially creepy conceit into an odd, touching adventure.
12217	3	a	Perhaps too laden with messages for its own good, but it has many moments of musical beauty.
12218	7	a	Vertical Limit kept testing my horizontal limit. Everytime anybody talked I started to fall asleep.
12219	4	a	Backbeat, which for all its pretensions can often be impressively canny and affectionate about its subject, is helped enormously by newly recorded versions of Beatle records.
12220	0	a	It's devilishly clever, bleakly hilarious, and fatalistically romantic throughout, a celebration of grand, doomed gestures made for the sake of making them.
12221	4	a	As it goes on, Revolutionary Road starts to feel like a tepid rewrite of a Douglas Sirk weepie.
12222	3	a	Treats its audience as a friend, inviting one and all to share in the fun; the dialogue, as atrocious as it is, is recited knowing wholeheartedly the very audience sharing the joke on the other side of the screen.
12223	3	a	"...has twice the laughs and six times the personality of feeble, prefabricated sitcoms like ""American Pie""..."
12224	4	a	Coasts on considerable star power to make us laugh with some consistency but never approaches the level of fearless comic abandon that made the first film so popular.
12225	1	a	Trainspotting, buoyed by a great Brit Pop soundtrack and Brian Tufano's agile cinematography, captures the stoned-out, gut-churning experience of hardcore addiction with hallucinogenic acuity.
12226	8	a	It is like watching butter melt at room temperature.
12227	5	a	If Gibson imagined that this extended detailing of sadism would somehow be inspirational, he needs to be taken off his biblical steroids.
12228	1	a	It's preoccupied with textures and touch, with fabric, food and foliage. Yet it's a sensuous telling of a rather pessimistic story.
12229	2	a	...a romantic thriller on the lighter side, providing ample rewards for those willing to play along.
12230	5	a	James L. Brooks has clearly spent far too long in Los Angeles.
12231	0	a	Hawks never did anything self-consciously. You always realize how great his films are after you're through enjoying yourself.
12232	0	a	Ethereal, gorgeous, and evocative.
12233	3	a	Sure, it's just two or three people bonding over the twin addictions of the title. But Jarmusch makes it a feast that plays like a haunting concept album.
12234	3	a	The story's fractured structure -- and Christopher Doyle's dreamlike cinematography -- make for a striking mood piece.
12235	2	a	I wish The Soloist had done more than pay lip service to this subject, but the traces of what might have been are still resonant.
12236	9	a	Watching this movie is like trying to survive on Red Bull and Skittles. It might keep you up for a little bit, but before too long, you'll just want to throw up.
12237	4	a	Sausage Party is a full-on assault on civility and social mores. Yes, that's the point, and yes, it's quite funny on occasion. Maybe it's just too much.
12238	4	a	While the emphasis is more on the first part than on the second part of that compound, it's okay.
12239	2	a	It's not always a riveting sit, perhaps too procedural at times, but the effort excels at providing a glimpse of a little-known human rights violation, and one that continues to occur around the world to this day.
12240	2	a	Ralph Breaks the Internet is the cinematic equivalent of clickbait - you just can't help yourself but follow it down the rabbit hole.
12241	4	a	Man of the Year is a moderately funny little movie that isn't pointed enough to successfully skewer its political targets.
12242	2	a	The problem is that even Fincher can't renew the impact of Larsson's original twists, unless you have an aversion to long books or subtitles
12243	3	a	Despite the provocative imagery and subject matter, First Reformed is a film that revels in its solemnity and speaks with a furious sincerity.
12244	3	a	A great script, visually stunning cinematography and great direction from Kate's husband Sam Mendes make this a remarkable experience.
12245	4	a	These pieces come together, but they don't always fit.
12246	5	a	The moral of Angry Birds is that it's fine -- even necessary and virtuous -- to be angry, to rage, and to destroy. Have fun explaining that one to the kids.
12247	2	a	So refreshingly smart.
12248	6	a	"With Tom Hanks in front of and behind the camera and Julia Roberts his co-star, you'd think ""Larry Crowne"" would have some A-list Hollywood charm. You're incorrect."
12249	5	a	Malcolm D. Lee directs in the semaphore approach to comic performance: playing every gesture big enough to be seen from miles away.
12250	6	a	Flashes of engagement mired in starry-eyed pabulum with a bubble-gum score to match.
12251	1	a	The best movie about slacking since 'The Mother and the Whore.'
12252	9	a	The minstrelsy of Gooding Jr.'s performance is abhorrent but no more offensive than the showboating that won him the Oscar.
12253	3	a	Unashamedly brilliant, a fast and furious fusion of hip references, cute action, dynamic visuals and sheer delight.
12254	3	a	Despite its familiar, derivative, yet ironic, story, it's a sleek, stylish, sinister fun-flick with a speculative metaphysical ending that makes you think.
12255	5	a	More confusion than clarity.
12256	1	a	Comedic indie filmmaking at its best.
12257	3	a	It's Moore who really brings the film home. It's in her expression when the doctor gives his diagnosis and pessimistic prognosis. It's in the way she looks at her family, knowing there will come a time when she won't recognize them.
12258	9	a	Slathers itself in scatology, crotch-punching, hilarious elder/child abuse, and a brutal ration of unearned sentiment.
12259	6	a	Cold Creek Manor is cautious to the point of inert.
12260	3	a	...a natural evolution from where the last one left off, and is packed to the brim with surprises, meta references and immense creativity...
12261	3	a	They are dark, thoroughly uncompromising works of a filmmaker completely fearless to take an audience into dank recesses of the human condition.
12262	3	a	"Andrew Stanton has created a fantastic and magical epic that makes ""John Carter"" the rightful heir to the Star Wars legacy."
12263	5	a	A couple of good chuckles can't redeem this sappy mess.
12264	4	a	The incendiary soundtrack and committed performances keep the film in its groove, which could give Cheadle another well-deserved shot at an Oscar.
12265	5	a	A re-hash of tired cliches and CGI effects.
12266	3	a	For Schrader, ideas are paramount, and he packs in plenty, none less profound than the proposition that, to survive, we must hold hope and despair in our minds simultaneously.
12267	3	a	It's pretty incredible to see how the filmmakers easily and boldly slip concepts right from the therapist's office into the wild rumpus through the internet.
12268	3	a	The first movie was such an endorphin rush, it is hard to imagine a sequel that could match it in sweet, rambunctious fun. But this follow-up comes very close. 
12269	1	a	Casey Affleck gives an outstanding performance that proves him to be a character actor of immense creativity, clarity and composure.
12270	3	a	[A] strange, sad, mesmerizing little movie.
12271	3	a	This is musical history that deserves to be placed alongside the best of its era.
12272	4	a	[Gondry] has done a stellar job of putting his wacky auteurial stamp on a comedy which is only semi-coherent but still very funny and impeccably fashioned.
12273	2	a	Entertaining because of its intricate plot, kinetic editing and imaginative camera angles.
12274	0	a	"Like all the best suspense films, ""Jaws"" manages to somehow remain amazingly tense, even if you've seen the film before. No wonder so many moviegoers went back for repeat viewings."
12275	5	a	Arthur Golden's bestselling novel has been transfigured into an overripe romance that manages the not-so-cute trick of being both glitzy and ponderous while straining for delicacy and grandeur.
12276	3	a	An updated, more sophisticated take on those old Burt Reynold's seventies good ol'boy flicks. 
12277	0	a	The year's best movie. Period. And finally a best actor nod for Bruce Dern and add a nod for June Squibb who does the year's best supporting performance. 
12278	4	a	It's Annette Bening who powers the film, holds our interest and makes us care about a woman heretofore mostly unknown to us.
12279	7	a	Almost entertaining in it's campy stupidity.
12280	1	a	Overnight, Howard seems to have turned into a combination of the best aspects of Oliver Stone and Robert Altman.
12281	4	a	Close your eyes and listen, and imagine the central roles played by less predictable actors who regularly do indie flicks - say, Paul Giamatti and Patricia Clarkson. The material is here but it's swamped by celebrity.
12282	4	a	Just because there is nothing new under the sun doesn't mean McCarthy can't make hay while it shines.
12283	6	a	As the series drags on, the inventiveness of murders decreases slightly but Freddy's humor continues to entertain.
12284	4	a	Arranged in short episodes, each composed entirely of awkward and embarassed conversation between midlevel celebs, Coffee and Cigarettes entertains fitfully.
12285	3	a	NEBRASKA is measured, sad, funny, and in its simplicity impressively well written.
12286	6	a	Big ideas can sometimes lead to great motion pictures or, as in the case of I Origins, colossal misfires.
12287	5	a	Even though the basics are in place, they've been squandered by director John Schultz - a man who doesn't seem to have the first idea about how to shoot action, or comedy, or anything else.
12288	6	a	It's hard to make out what, if anything, writer-director Eric England is trying to say about the fragility of the flesh with Contracted, which amounts to little more than a slow-motion replay of The Fly's central gross-out.
12289	3	a	Thomas hit the mark with Bell and a decade away has not dulled the razor wit Veronica wields toward any adversary unfortunate enough to cross her path.
12290	3	a	Spy Kids is flat out a good time for the whole family. 
12291	10	a	And now, the prequel Hannibal Rising, which answers several questions: Where did Hannibal come from? What made him what he is?... It does not, however, answer the better question: Who fricking cares?
12292	0	a	Thrilling, heartwarming, scary, and superb.
12293	1	a	The movie eloquently mourns the death of innocence and friendship. It also is a showcase for six stunning performances.
12294	9	a	...utterly confused over what to do with McCarthy as a physical comedienne.
12295	5	a	It takes Stockwell forever to get these details into place, because he's primarily concerned with Caribbean and bikini-clad eye candy. But even that loses its novelty in a ridiculous showcase like this.
12296	3	a	A legitimate achievement in horror filmmaking.
12297	1	a	You won't know whether to laugh openly or curl up with horror.
12298	1	a	The final third of this film contains sequences of horrifying sublimity and ethereal beauty, moments that have a clarity and power beyond the reach of reason.
12299	6	a	What the film seems to be running away from is the fact that for all his genius, James Brown was not a man you would want to spend much time around.
12300	3	a	Quite simply, one of the most sheerly enjoyable movies of the year....we're lucky to have [Soderbergh] back.
12301	3	a	Whedon's smart, densely plotted, fast-paced story provides ample opportunities for characterization, revealing the pain beneath the characters' defensive humor.
12302	3	a	The smartest thing about Kelly Fremon Craig's teen dramedy is its measured take on its protagonist's theatrics.
12303	3	a	A vibrant feel for its era and a genuine affection for its characters make the whole thing a solid evocation of a time and a life worth remembering.
12304	6	a	Plays it far too safe and ends up not saying anything at all.
12305	6	a	Casa de los Babys has a grander scope than Sayles was either able to afford or invest enough time in developing.
12306	3	a	I don't think I've seen an actor do more with deadpan expressions than Mara does in this movie. Her face doesn't move but, whether she's tasing a man or standing in front of a mirror watching a cigarette dangle from her mouth, we respond to her.
12307	2	a	Black Snake Moan is a weird little story held together by two gobsmacking performances.
12308	5	a	A soulless box-ticking travelogue of young adult tropes that arrives years after the genre gravy train has dried up.
12309	3	a	A hypnotic cocktail of haunting visuals, strong performances and mesmerizing score. Take the best bits of this captivating new work and cut them into the negligible flaws of the original film and you'd have a perfect story.
12310	4	a	It is impressive that director Dean Parisot kept the chuckles coming as long as he did. This is a one-viewing film, but pleasant enough.
12311	5	a	Mann wants to distance his film from the Reagan-era consumerist fantasy of the TV show that inspired it, but all he does is put a dour veneer of visual grime over the same attitudes.
12312	2	a	...this isn't Thomas Wolfe, but the cycle of rejection and reconciliation does feel a little like a gloss on You Can't Go Home Again
12313	3	a	Not your grandfather's John Carter.
12314	5	a	As a film director, Prince remains a brilliant musician.
12315	2	a	For some of us, every day is a good day for zombies, and Land of the Dead lets their primary wholesaler do what he does best.
12316	5	a	It's got some lively moments, but mostly just sits there on screen. The film's lack of ambition is troubling
12317	6	a	Keenen Ivory Wayans is so much more interesting, lively, and fun than Seagal you wish that he were the star of the film.
12318	1	a	"With ""Bright Star,"" writer/director Jane Campion has made a film that is like a flip, 'civilized,' version of ""The Piano's"" exotic wilderness."
12319	5	a	There's little in Bleed for This that you haven't seen before, and lots you've seen far too often.
12320	7	a	No thrills on this hill
12321	5	a	Fraudulent where it should be smart, impotent where it should be sexy, and dull where it should be exciting, The Tourist is a big star misfire of epic proportions.
12322	6	a	Just preaching to the choir - even a secular choir - isn't enough.
12323	3	a	powerful, unsettling
12324	4	a	If the movie meanders, it's refreshing to see a May-September romance in which May is played by the man for once and where the sex is happy, frank, and frequent.
12325	3	a	The early going of the film is terrific ... This material is so strong that it's almost a shame when the science fiction angle takes over.
12326	5	a	Astro Boy grinds through its narrative gears predictably.
12327	8	a	[Dahl's] been beaten down either by the idiot script or the idiot moneymen or both.
12328	4	a	A squandered opportunity to tell what may have been an interesting story.
12329	4	a	... it's as comprehensible as any Dummies guide, something even non-techies can enjoy.
12330	0	a	A five star hoot.
12331	3	a	A well-wrought thriller about one group's attempts to assassinate Adolf Hitler.
12332	3	a	At its best The Cloverfield Paradox is a fantastically tense locked room mystery in space, playing off complex concepts like quantum entanglement theory. In its weaker moments, it's a solid sci-fi that leans heavily into the giants who've walked before it
12333	9	a	I'd like to be able to say they couldn't pay me to see this flick. Alas, it's apparent I can be bought, and pretty cheaply too.
12334	2	a	[Helmer] Apatow and company's latest endeavor has a lot going for it, including heart and intelligence.
12335	3	a	It's well-crafted and enjoyable. You'll laugh, more than once, but you might not remember why the next day.
12336	3	a	The rather sitcom-like nature of the movie's execution is offset by the pervasively affable atmosphere...
12337	0	a	Elevator to the Gallows, killer stuff.
12338	2	a	"Its only aim is to make us jump, make us laugh, and send us off with a thrilling final shot that's everything a ""Cloverfield"" fan could want from a prequel."
12339	1	a	"Blanchett is a naturally theatrical actress, unafraid of being ""dramatic."" Because of this, she sometimes seems out of place in a realistic context. But ""Carol"" plays to her strengths."
12340	9	a	A stiff and stilted historical pageant that somehow manages to make the savage tumult of thousands pitched against thousands seem not so much dreadul as dreadfully dull.
12341	1	a	American Pyscho is one of those films that makes you laugh uncomfortably throughout and you just walk away feeling disgusted. The flick is definitely an underrated masterpiece.
12342	9	a	However low your expectations are for the movie take on the videogame Doom, lower them more
12343	5	a	The show's over. We're pitched out. Aca-exit stage left.
12344	5	a	...most of it was unfunny...
12345	4	a	First Reformed is a deeply felt, deeply thought picture; impressive in its seriousness and often gripping in the way it frames itself as a debate and a sermon.
12346	1	a	While it may not make you as emotional as the first film, it's a must-see for the amount of cameos it includes, two fun end-credits scenes, and plenty of well-earned laughs for both kids and adults.
12347	3	a	BOLT is an insignificant cartoon, but undeniably enjoyable. I was smiling through most of it and I imagine kids will too.
12348	6	a	Minus the corn, it's almost good.
12349	2	a	Director Ang Lee has taken the very internal novel by Dallas author Ben Fountain - a work that tries to get into the head of an Iraq War soldier -- and opened it up into a surprisingly effective meditation on a soldier's homefront experience.
12350	7	a	Out of the murk.
12351	6	a	Grammarians, if few others, will be satisfied.
12352	4	a	As befits Woody Allen, Midnight in Paris. is chock-full of cultural homages: Hemingway and Stein are just a small sample of the legends Allen parades onscreen.
12353	1	a	Ralph Breaks the Internet: A film that mixes every property within the Disney universe, and some that aren't, while finding roots in existentialism...
12354	8	a	The cinematic equivalent of safety scissors -- all softened edges and no real point.
12355	4	a	This is a very raunchy and explicit comedy but it is all done with sweetness and even a certain humility that keeps it from being too disgusting.
12356	0	a	Throughout the film, Spielberg evokes the kind of armchair-clutching action sequences that remind us why they're called motion pictures.
12357	3	a	overall the movie does take allegiances with both the book and original movie, but it comes into its own to unravel a truly alluring story.
12358	3	a	Writer-director Tamara Jenkins ... allows the movie its real-life bitterness without pushing it over into despair.
12359	3	a	[It] goes beyond the pretty visuals and the slam-bam action to get us under the skin of a family trying hard to be something they're not.
12360	4	a	A cross between Stand And Deliver and Hoosiers,...it's no all-star, but not a bench-warmer either.
12361	5	a	A huge letdown.
12362	3	a	"From the opening moments of the film, ""The Predator"" maintains an engaging swashbuckling sci-fi energy and strikes a strong balance of humor and action that evokes the best of its genre"
12363	6	a	Lee and producer-screenwriter James Schamus aim for comedy but come up with cliches.
12364	5	a	Never manages anything like thrills and by the long-delayed end has turned into one big forced march.
12365	4	a	Director Steven Quale invests the production with a little more wit than usual. You're gonna want to keep an eye on the production design.
12366	0	a	This masterpiece from Frank Capra still has a lot to say about community spirit and is a film with much more to it than feel-good sentimentality.
12367	6	a	Although Myers is a brilliant comic, any potential he has as a romantic lead remains unfulfilled.
12368	0	a	My favorite Ingmar Bergman film, without question.
12369	2	a	It is neither deep nor mind-blowing. But we shouldn't deny the very concrete delectations it offers. 
12370	9	a	Man of the Year is longer than the FDR administration, less funny than Calvin Coolidge and deader than Abe Lincoln.
12371	5	a	The new prequel Hannibal Rising provides a back story that ought to have remained firmly in our imaginations.
12372	6	a	Can't seem to summon up that old Black magic.
12373	6	a	This melancholy tale - not so much about the afterlife as about its teasingly morbid lure on three people in different countries - is far from director Clint Eastwood's best, and comes with a particularly dull performance from Matt Damon. 
12374	2	a	An original modern-day black comedy based in fantasy that delivers a great cast, fun undertones a la Wizard of Oz and a terrific performance from Renee Zellweger.
12375	5	a	Reign of Fire requires too much suspension of disbelief.
12376	5	a	Not the film America deserves, and it is also not the film America needs. But we got it anyway.
12377	3	a	The Green Hornet smoked crack with Superman and met CraigsList chicks with Wolverine. He's a bad influence and a good time. And he's much more entertaining on screen, too.
12378	4	a	Kudos to Miller for her touching portrayal of a doomed icon. A shame the film's as substantial as one of Warhol's silver flotations.
12379	1	a	"It's not often that a movie can affect you and make you laugh out loud all at once, but ""Silver Linings Playbook"" coordinates the task with ease."
12380	3	a	Fine, sprawling period piece. A great swan song for Cagney.
12381	0	a	Its plump chickens maintain that strange, haptic quality that makes you yearn to reach out and squeeze them.
12382	5	a	Hook is overwhelmed by a screenplay heavy with complicated exposition, by what are, in effect, big busy nonsinging, nondancing production numbers and some contemporary cant about rearing children and the high price paid for success.
12383	9	a	A miscast Ryan struggles with a Detroit accent and a script that goes nowhere.
12384	6	a	The only fun in Red Planet is trying to spot the reflections of the camera and crew in the smoothly-polished faceplates of the astronauts.
12385	2	a	The next time an international action star comes calling on Hollywood, and needs a buddy action-comedy partner, I hope they pick Owen Wilson again.
12386	3	a	Daniel Craig displays a gift for character comedy that suggests he'll have plenty of new and exciting avenues to explore in his post-Bond career.
12387	3	a	Mystic River may only be 'pretty good,' but thanks to Eastwood, it's a reminder of how great 'pretty good' should be.
12388	6	a	The historical Edie Sedgwick was a fascinating figure and at no time was she more interesting than when she was a member of Warhol's Factory. It's too bad Factory Girl fails to make this woman compelling in these circumstances.
12389	5	a	About as anachronistic and generic as an action sequel could be.
12390	0	a	A deeply fascinating look at violence.
12391	8	a	The only really nice thing about the story is that it doesn't opt for a Hollywood happy ending.
12392	1	a	We come down to the simple fact that this is Cowboy Bebop, and in the end, the journey taken is more important than whether or not it makes any sense.
12393	1	a	Do they give awards based on balls-out craziness? They should. This one would sweep that ceremony.
12394	7	a	Nothing about this lackluster comedy's potentially rich conceit is handled in an emotionally honest or resonant manner.
12395	6	a	...the film is too loaded with inside jokes and mutual admiration and camaraderie to draw in the audience.
12396	3	a	"Three Billboards"" raises the stakes as it goes."
12397	6	a	The rest of the cast doesn't look like it's having nearly as much fun as Nielsen is, but they are all exceedingly game and that's all that matters in these movies.
12398	10	a	A generic time-waster powered by a lazy, cynical combination of scatological kiddie humor and maudlin sentiment.
12399	4	a	"When, in Jackson's film, someone describes a character's ""love of gold"" as having become ""too fierce,"" you wonder if the warning might apply to ""The Hobbit"" in other ways."
12400	2	a	"Hitchcock"" is, well, fun. More fun than good, really."
12401	6	a	Contracted is an efficiently icky, gross-out exercise in body horror that should please fans of this kind of thing. Still, the lack of any substance below the surface is ultimately too frustrating to ignore.
12402	9	a	It even fails to enter the so-bad-its-good club.
12403	4	a	We can't quite shake the feeling we've seen this all done before, and better.
12404	2	a	the score by Miles is a remarkable one, tapping into the jazzy zeitgeist of the time
12405	1	a	Parents, don't nap while the kids watch.
12406	5	a	A workaholic roused to life by his contact with an extraordinary person. Music healing all ills. The rehabilitation of an impaired genius. The only reason any of this is barely watchable is because of the stars.
12407	3	a	Fortunately the book is virtually foolproof if you leave it to speak for itself, as [Fincher] has done, thereby delivering a decent movie.
12408	3	a	It is not a holiday classic on par with A Christmas Story. But it does provide a lot of laughs and does do exactly what a yuletide movie should: it makes merry.
12409	4	a	Good-looking, well-acted and now and then shamelessly sentimental paean to perseverance, spirit and Irish humor.
12410	4	a	Based on this one performance, Alwyn appears to have the emotional resources to scale even greater acting heights in the future. Whether the same will be the case for high-frame-rate cinema remains to be, literally, seen.
12411	6	a	...there comes a point at which Into the Blue becomes just overwhelmingly silly...
12412	4	a	Knowing the ending robs the film of some of the suspense, but Cruise and company have made a better movie than expected
12413	6	a	Though diehard fans probably will take issue, Serenity is mostly sci-fi silliness attempting to be something more substantive.
12414	4	a	A dumb film with a great conceptual hook from a director who visualizes better than he dramatizes.
12415	4	a	Cameron is forever associated with the fateful ship, and I think it's time he moved on.
12416	5	a	This brooding comedy fails to blend the sensibilities of two artists, director Richard Linklater and writer Eric Bogosian, which couldn't have been more different--the only thing they share together is a concern with youth's discontent.
12417	4	a	Amusing...Jason unapologetically slashes his way through every predictable scene without concern for originality or story, right down to the typical cliffhanger ending.
12418	4	a	The short films in this collection are dreamily affecting curiosities, stilted and just enough off-kilter to keep the viewer attentive.
12419	4	a	The decision to make this a Cloverfield movie at the last minute didn't make the movie any better. In fact, it probably made it worse.
12420	3	a	Gia Coppola's debut about the teen experience has a lyricism that transcends James Franco's mediocre source.
12421	4	a	The film isn't easy to watch, but its portrait of perseverance and ecological commitment is enlightening.
12422	2	a	Todd Haynes' resonant period romance echoes 'Far From Heaven,' but Cate Blanchett and Rooney Mara elude that film's glossy fatalism.
12423	9	a	As is the case with most sequels, the quality is much lower than the original.
12424	4	a	Liam Neeson is quietly devastating in a sluggish biopic of Watergate's Deep Throat that is eerily relevant if you wonder if they'll be a modern-day Felt to bring down the White House.
12425	6	a	A lot like a theme-park ride: occasionally exciting but carefully controlled.
12426	8	a	"If this is what the ""golden years"" are going to be like, count me out. "
12427	10	a	Bashing your head against the wall would be more fun than The Road Chip.
12428	4	a	Christopher Robin serves as a reminder to the life we have left behind, for even the happiest children with the warmest friends have to grow up some time. 
12429	5	a	It isn't funny, and it isn't exciting.
12430	3	a	Dizzyingly meta, maddeningly broad, then oddly moving.
12431	3	a	Roach ... knows to play to the movie's twin strengths: Stiller and De Niro.
12432	3	a	[An] engaging, funny and touching film.
12433	3	a	"Bee Movie"" has a little bit of something for everyone. It's loaded with action and sight gags for the kids and enough adult humor to keep the grownups happy."
12434	4	a	Revolutionary takes us down a familiar road.
12435	5	a	Saddled with an inconsistent plot, maudlin melodrama and surprising cynicism about the heroism of young soldiers coming home from war.
12436	1	a	'Saint Laurent' imagines the life of the influential French fashion designer as a series of aesthetic, erotic episodes. 
12437	4	a	Romero's script isn't a thing of grace and beauty, but it achieves a sort of brawny entertainment that works in the moment.
12438	1	a	There is breezy comedy to be made of a YouTube-age writer meeting the icons and idols of a bygone, classical era, but Allen goes deeper, expanding on his time-travel device to make unexpected and unexpectedly generous observations.
12439	10	a	Mean-spirited, unpleasant comedy about characters who are both nasty and stupid and who deserve every bad thing that happens to them. In fact, they deserve more.
12440	9	a	Cool game plan on paper, unfortunately, the execution lacks. Further, this is not the subject matter with which to play games.
12441	6	a	Bodily functions and fluids serve as a thin clothesline for cheap laughs.
12442	8	a	Like The Breakfast Club recast as a videogame for simpletons.
12443	5	a	Tthe enthusiastic hamming can't hide the clunking direction by Sidney J Furie and the sub-standard special effects.
12444	4	a	Smith manages to successfully subsume his slackers feel into a more cartoony aesthetic. And the mall ode-cum-satire, like with Clerks' convenience store, is brilliantly done. 
12445	3	a	Its head is in the gutter, yes, but its heart and brain are in the right place.
12446	5	a	Unfortunately, the recycled plot is still the driving force here, and the movie becomes increasingly frantic trying to accommodate it. In the end, Raffill can't bring this dummy to life, but he does try.
12447	5	a	[Yimou] turns the Rape of Nanking into a visually stunning melodrama. But the effect of such extreme contrast is unsettling to say the least.
12448	3	a	'Early Man' is a minor entry in the Aardman catalogue, but still quite likable and funny. 
12449	4	a	For all its ridiculousness, its enthusiastic comic excess, and its fart/booger/gross-out jokes, Diary Of A Wimpy Kid's heart is firmly in the right place.
12450	0	a	Oyelowo's performance exists on a single continuum, convincing us that the man inspiring millions is the same man we saw grieving alone just a few minutes before. He's the man we knew, and never knew.
12451	4	a	Eventually the film itself is something of an endurance test, and not as rewarding as it hopes to be. But it's a worthy venture, earnest and well-produced and occasionally gripping.
12452	3	a	If the film falls short of greatness, it's because Button remains too enigmatic.
12453	1	a	Eastwood's maturity is reflected in the story that doesn't back away from hard subjects and can admit that pain and remorse can mold a man's life.
12454	4	a	Fifty years on, we're still living with the aftershocks of what Muddy and Wolf invented and the Chess brothers midwived, but it's in the air and not yet on the screen.
12455	9	a	Director Barry Battles seems to believe his three grubby main characters are more charming than they are.
12456	6	a	The character doesn't change...[he] stays the way he was when he was this 'simpleton with wisdom,' and that's too Gump-like.
12457	0	a	While it may be a Gen-Z era coming out story, it easily resonates for older generations.
12458	2	a	Donald Sutherland walks away with the film.
12459	1	a	With stunning landscapes around the Tex-Mex border shot by Roger Deakins and the elements of pursuit and retribution, the saga draws from the Western tradition in which the characters become dwarfed by nature.
12460	3	a	Videocracy makes spooky comedy of a nation's addiction to fame.
12461	6	a	If it's dumb humans crashing through the undergrowth you're after, rent a Rambo movie instead.
12462	10	a	Oh yes, it's Catwoman bad.
12463	3	a	Call Me By Your Name is a very tasteful exercise. This is one of those movie environments that admits only the intelligent, the well-dressed and the culturally sophisticated.
12464	1	a	One of the most entertaining vehicles of the year.
12465	8	a	You're better off renting the original and getting yourself a pizza....
12466	5	a	A hundred or so minutes of missable anti-entertainment.
12467	2	a	The scruffiness is hardly accidental, but it gives the picture a gentle warmth and easy charm that make it as pleasant, if as passing, as a warm summer breeze.
12468	4	a	Eastwood masterfully re-creates the blood-curdling fear and panic on the train, contrasting that with the men's astonishing courage as the rest of the passengers do what most people would: Freeze and cower.
12469	2	a	...a breezy, nasty little film that delivers more than it promises.
12470	0	a	An explosive, provocative black comedy from Tennessee Williams and Elia Kazan.
12471	6	a	It would take a far more intelligent movie than Air Force One to credibly explore the issues raised by this hyperactive plot.
12472	1	a	Laurel Canyon isn't about philandering but it's about something just as real: emotional drift. The film captures with razor precision the subatomic electric spark between two people who are feeling and fighting an attraction to one another.
12473	3	a	Possibly second only to Goblet of Fire of all the Potter films to date, Chamber of Secrets should please fans and muggles alike.
12474	6	a	full review in Greek
12475	6	a	The comedy is drab and predictable. The satirical flourishes are so soft that they are hardly worth mentioning. The thrills are diffused by tonal shifts working against them.
12476	5	a	Wong and Morgan: your diminished returns are ready. Get 'em while they're hot.
12477	7	a	It's painful to watch actors like McConaughey and Bale, who showed so much potential at one time in their careers, shamelessly overact and spout inane dialogue.
12478	4	a	Feels like the beginning of a discussion, one Eastwood likely has with his peers as they age. 
12479	4	a	The film is imperfect, periodically if unsurprisingly sentimental, overly tidy and often very moving.
12480	3	a	Though inspired by real-life journals, Guerra's haunting and beautifully shot film transports us into the realm of the mystical and surreal.
12481	4	a	Worth seeing for Stone's grotesque bow and some great youthful performances. But it's not half as gritty as it thinks it is.
12482	3	a	These are the films we celebrate.
12483	2	a	A period piece typified by restraint, delicacy and the romantic spirit of its renowned subject.
12484	6	a	In all its beautiful spectacle and skin-crawling ugliness, it is very much something that should be at least sampled, just for a taste of it.
12485	2	a	A laugh-filled, good-hearted spoof.
12486	3	a	..worth noting that both Wolff and Delevingne are lacking in the unreasonably glamorous looks that actors tend to boast in films of this ilk, with the two actors possessing an everyday, far-from-stunning appearance that's nothing short of refreshing.
12487	6	a	It may not be as fresh as its predecessor, it still begs a look-see. As the year winds down, this is one fine holiday ham that should be savored, not skinned.
12488	4	a	While it's quirky and intriguing, this is the kind of wilfully nutty black comedy that treads the extremely thin line between inventiveness and pretentiousness.
12489	3	a	Witty direction and an exceptionally sharp script give this coming-of-age film a blast of originality that completely wins us over.
12490	0	a	Steadfastness, truth and a simple, blazing, incandescent humanity. This is a literary life story in which life, for once, is the meaningful word.
12491	4	a	The cod-psychologising is a little clunky but [Helen] Mirren's Mrs Hitch is inspiringly ballsy - with a dollop of the vulnerability that made you sob in The Queen. 
12492	5	a	For all its high-brow posturing, this film is tedious. 
12493	0	a	A movie that starts strong and just builds, always pushing forward yet still finding time for interesting detours.
12494	2	a	The Mambo Kings is a tinsel-edged dream of a movie.
12495	0	a	Anything could have happened. The unthinkable often did. And Selma depicts it all with a gripping, majestic flourish that feels just right.
12496	6	a	Overlong, repetitive, too simplistic, and bland despite oodles of breathtaking scenery. It's like a healthy dish that looks aesthetically pleasing, but lacks flavor and needs a more talented chef. 
12497	3	a	In Boseman's hands - and his feet, and his entire body, for that matter - he demands and earns our attention. 
12498	2	a	A smart, fun movie that also feels distinctly like at least a half-season worth of plot and character crammed into a film's running time.
12499	3	a	This is the kind of movie that's best enjoyed as a stylized fantasy, much like Brewer's most obvious model, Elia Kazan's Southern-fried Tennessee Williams adaptation Baby Doll.
12500	4	a	So many subplots are piled onto Meet the Fockers that it's a wonder any of the glittering talents assembled here have room to be funny.
12501	5	a	A dreary, self-consciously quirky indie flick that seems to go on forever, despite an economical running time.
12502	2	a	Beautifully organized.
12503	3	a	The Angry Birds movie has a lot of poop jokes, fun, and pop culture references, but it does it going out of common places, which is something we can appreciate. [Full review in Spanish]
12504	9	a	Lecter is presented as a soul-dead vigilante who reserves his carnage for the truly deserving; that's a long way from the Lecter of Silence of the Lambs who kills and tortures innocent and guilty alike.
12505	4	a	The symbols are all functional and Cronenberg's allegory for a civilization divorcing itself from its own humanity is entirely realized, but without a potent emotional angle, it's little more than an intellectual exercise.
12506	6	a	Don't believe the pre-release hype, this one's only for those of you who simply have to sit through all the Best Picture nominees.
12507	1	a	Unusual and delightful.
12508	6	a	...generally comes off as an overwrought and flat-out silly piece of work.
12509	3	a	Strictly B-movie but rocking with energy.
12510	2	a	"Daniela Thomas previously teamed with other directors, most notably Walter Salles, but ""Vazante"" marks her first time behind the camera alone. With those decades of experience in mind, this film never feels like a debut."
12511	5	a	Determining the exact level of artifice never stops being distracting, and the emotional climax is far from earned.
12512	3	a	It's a very impressive, very accomplished film.
12513	5	a	As a romantic comedy this is very aptly titled, but it earns an extra star for Zooey Deschanel's bonkers performance. They should have made the film all about her.
12514	3	a	Don Cheadle and Chiwetel Ejiofor take charge of screen so decisively that any shortcomings in the script are strictly secondary to their dynamic performances
12515	4	a	All of the red meat is just beneath the surface, occasionally poking through but mostly remaining buried.
12516	3	a	Sayles's latest clash between over- and underprivileged cultures focuses solely on the issue of motherhood, but within this one issue he explores the widest range of emotions.
12517	3	a	A smart little comedy that tosses some sharp little darts at our consumer-driven culture.
12518	1	a	The brilliance of Ava DuVernay's Selma lies in how it makes a man out of a historical icon without diminishing his greatness in the slightest.
12519	3	a	Sit back, relax and watch some of the world's best actresses kick up their heels and have a great time doing it.
12520	5	a	The movie can only skate so far on Depp's charisma and a handful of gleefully bent internal monologues. It has no fun in winding to its oafish, obvious conclusion. 
12521	5	a	With nods to Spielberg, Stanley Kubrick and a host of sci-fi B-movies, the film's pop-culture references are there but predictable rather than inspired. A bit like the whole movie.
12522	2	a	Eastwood is one of the most reliable and assured directors working today and like most of his films Invictus combines his disciplined approach to filmmaking with his calm desire to not rush proceedings in order to allow the story to leisurely unfold.
12523	1	a	Employing, as he's sometimes done in the past, a cast of mostly first-time film actors, Loach here whips up a sad but deeply engrossing tale of an adolescent Scottish lad's determination to salvage his unsavable family.
12524	4	a	However imperfectly, [Speilberg] has crafted another eloquent reminder that although goodness lives with a perpetual sense of weariness in its battle with the self-renewing power of evil, it can never retreat, never sleep.
12525	6	a	The film seems to have forgotten, however, that it's still a movie, not a documentary - a detrimental misfire that cancels out its own charms.
12526	3	a	"Jurassic Park"" is such an impressive technical achievement that it seems churlish to note that it accomplishes this at the expense of more substantive elements."
12527	5	a	Melodrama is bad enough, contrived melodrama is worse, and badly written contrived melodrama is Autumn in New York.
12528	3	a	Here we see Marc Foster with more ease than in previous works, managing to combine humor with a very marked English style. [Full Review in Spanish]
12529	5	a	Eat, pray, love? More like eat, pray, snooze.
12530	3	a	This is a really funny black comedy that satisfies anyone's needs to ever beat up their awful, power-hungry bosses.
12531	4	a	The sillier scenes of Bill Murray traipsing through a dangerous part of the world are fun, but when the story tries to get at something more serious, it falls apart pretty quickly.
12532	1	a	These days, it's almost impossible to find a gritty science fiction motion picture that doesn't owe at least a small debt to Blade Runner's visual style.
12533	2	a	Don't let the trailers and adverts fool you. The Dressmaker is a viciously dark comedy that will catch many by surprise. 
12534	1	a	Working with gifted artists and designers, [Burton] has made a world here that is as completely new as the worlds we saw for the first time in such films as Metropolis, The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari or Star Wars.
12535	5	a	"White House meets outhouse"" comedy isn't fit to serve, and Marcia Gay Harden and Maura Tierney outshine stars Gene Hackman and Ray Romano."
12536	6	a	Sharply observed but poorly helmed and unevenly acted, this gross and sordid account of the early days of Internet Porn claims to be based on a factual story but its true inspiration is Boogie Nights, Paul Thomas Anderson's masterpiece.
12537	5	a	The picture betrays its own underlying philosophy about the importance of comedy in politics when, for the better part of its second hour, it becomes completely humorless.
12538	5	a	The story veers between interesting, boring and borderline incomprehensible.
12539	4	a	The movie is strongest when focusing on the co-dependent-before-that-was-a-term relationship between Byrd and Brown. Byrd worships Brown, but even he has his limits; Brown needs to be worshipped but believes in little but himself.
12540	9	a	Retains the philosophy of the previous three: there's no need to try very hard when your audience is composed of undiscerning children.
12541	0	a	A stunning and deceptively sophisticated picture...squarely in the tradition of Brecht. Monster deserves to keep winning awards, but the film is the real treasure.
12542	1	a	Written and directed by actor Vondie Curtis Hall, the film blends savvy and sour-mash humor with bone-deep sadness that recalls predecessors as varied as After Hours and Trainspotting.
12543	5	a	The filmmakers would rather sentimentalize their debauched hero than convince us there was insight in his cynicism or artfulness in his obscene verse.
12544	4	a	"Kitsch, best known for TV's ""Friday Night Lights,"" proves able to front a movie. The Canadian is as reliable as ""Avatar"" lead Sam Worthington, with a mix of good looks, brawn and generic heroism."
12545	6	a	"Hitchcock"" falls prey to its unfocused narrative intentions. "
12546	3	a	Greg Berlanti's groundbreaking gay romcom is an exuberant gift, a John Hughes movie for audiences who just got woke and the first mainstream studio release to put a closeted teen front and center. 
12547	3	a	It's touching and, at times, very funny.
12548	4	a	The best thing about this much-vaunted, overlong Irish epic love triangle is its gorgeous photography.
12549	3	a	Pedro Almodovar is finally back on track.
12550	2	a	Two things we now know about Craig Brewer's movies: They are completely ridiculous, and also compulsively watchable.
12551	6	a	What might have been delicious trash lacks the courage of its trashy convictions, and the result is high-born melodrama with the juice boiled out, so much dry cabbage on fine-china plate.
12552	4	a	The film is flush with done-to-death gross-out gags, bodily fluids serving as too many punch lines. Yes, girls can dish out F-bombs and body objectification as well as the boys can, but that shouldn't be the whole joke.
12553	3	a	A film that's both laugh out loud funny and surprisingly subtle.
12554	4	a	There's enough of a storyline here to keep younger space cadets moderately settled.
12555	8	a	If it were any worse, they'd be screening it as evidence at The Hague.
12556	5	a	without a pretext and knowledge of the classic author, much of the richness of this movie got lost
12557	4	a	If the filmmakers had resisted the urge to make it so adorable and meaningful, this could have been a terrific comedy.
12558	8	a	This noisy, dull, structurally messy adaptation of the popular videogame is a step down in the blossoming career of the gifted actor Mark Wahlberg.
12559	3	a	A very satisfying tale that emphasizes one of the genre's key themes: The deepest wound a samurai may suffer does not come from any blade.
12560	4	a	"Ironically for a movie boasting a brand new look, ""Billy Lynn"" is better to think about than to watch."
12561	3	a	A rockin' good time.
12562	7	a	This is one tin man with neither heart nor brains.
12563	4	a	A Roman version of Ben-Hur, Gladiator succeeds on only slightly more levels than it fails.
12564	1	a	The World's End might be the best time you'll have at the movies all year. It is a complete blast: urgently paced, hilariously clever and blisteringly profane.
12565	6	a	You go to America's Sweethearts anticipating a prime flossy, glossy entertainment. You come away better by a few laughs but with expectations sadly deflated.
12566	4	a	It has the fizzy good spirits of a flavored bottle of seltzer water, if not champagne.
12567	4	a	While part of Miami Vice plays out as well-researched and credible, there's some mighty sloppy scripting.
12568	3	a	This is a film that should leave an unpleasant taste in the mouth for any number of reasons, and yet tells a story charming enough to make it easy to overlook the corporate nature of the whole project.
12569	2	a	Thematically it works, even when it falls short dramatically.
12570	3	a	A lot more effective than most similar cop thrillers that go only for the conventional bang-bang scenarios.
12571	3	a	A fun, all-ages space adventure.
12572	3	a	... A beautiful, heartbreaking film ... packed with tender, loving performances and some of the most astounding visual effects we have ever seen.
12573	5	a	It might as well have been re-titled Red Herring: The Movie.
12574	3	a	Moore's complex and important film is also, believe it or not, immensely entertaining, a David and Goliath story that's still very much playing itself out.
12575	5	a	...the sum of the parts equals largely a confused mediocrity.
12576	1	a	...understands that even the slightest of gestures can crush.
12577	9	a	When a movie features Alba in a bikini for a good chunk of its running time and still can't hold a guy's interest, you know it has serious problems.
12578	7	a	An independent ensemble drama that's as conventional as any studio product...promises to be different but is, sadly, extremely familiar.
12579	1	a	"It's a charming, fanciful comedy in the vein of ""Bullets over Broadway"" and ""The Purple Rose of Cairo,"" the kind of movie I honestly thought Woody had lost the knack for. But you can never count him out."
12580	4	a	There is a lot of excitement and tension as the team progresses in the season. The only problem is the need to show every game - it suffers from overkill.
12581	5	a	It becomes an entirely different film, one not really premised on the bad-superhero comedy idea, and the film is then oddly without a sense of humour, and its vague interest in satire vanishes completely.
12582	6	a	A Watergate burglary story and its aftermath deserves a better telling than this. 
12583	2	a	Morgan Freeman makes for a remarkable Nelson Mandela.
12584	4	a	Think of it as a film that's meant to be experienced, more than fully understood.
12585	5	a	Inherent Vice is half-baked Raymond Chandler. With too much emphasis on the baked part.
12586	6	a	This Eminem melts in your hand and not in your mouth.
12587	6	a	Neither the movie nor the performance is memorable enough to cause much stir, and they will likely get lost amidst better end-of-the-year offerings.
12588	3	a	Great caper comedy that deftly balances high-tech gadgets and character humor.
12589	8	a	Fly Me to the Moon's idea of high hilarity is to have Nat's mom fret 'Oh my lord of the flies,' then feel the need to repeat the 'joke.'
12590	4	a	When a movie invites you to question its very reason for being, there's something wrong in the design.
12591	8	a	Any chance at building tension is quickly lost when whatever predicament the family finds itself in is wrapped up in the blink of an eye.
12592	4	a	Nearly every moment is infused with Importance.
12593	4	a	When it's funny, it's truly funny and the featured couples all have an easy and believable chemistry.
12594	3	a	Whatever it is, it's a pleasure to spend two hours inside it.
12595	4	a	"Safety Not Guaranteed"" won the Waldo Salt screenwriting award at the Sundance Film Festival, and it is a small-scale winner."
12596	2	a	Sinister, shivery, supernatural fun for the whole family.
12597	1	a	Without Fincher behind the scenes, this would be an occasionally interesting, often irritating trifle. With him, it's some manner of masterpiece.
12598	3	a	I wondered why there aren't more films -- especially comedies -- this sharp, this clever, this good.
12599	2	a	While Russell's film succeeds on the strength of its casting and characters, it's dragged down by a murky and poorly-paced narrative.
12600	4	a	The oddball characters, the black humor, the sudden bursts of violence - it all seems to be going well, until the film veers into gooey melodrama. It's like a perfectly-tailored suit that unexpectedly starts fraying at the seams.
12601	3	a	By the end, Whitaker's character has generated true poignance.
12602	6	a	The movie is so intent on displaying McConaughey's wares that it gives him a shirtless surfing scene -- and the picture is set in Baltimore.
12603	4	a	Celebrity and the PR politico
12604	7	a	[Plays] like one more piece of multiplex in-box clutter, ready for the circular file in our moviegoing consciousness.
12605	4	a	Ultimately, Memoirs of a Geisha compares unfavorably with the book, though it offers pleasures of its own.
12606	3	a	A very, very good thriller.
12607	1	a	If I have my druthers Adams will get her second Oscar nomination, part of me even hoping she can pull of the same Julie Andrews Mary Poppins miracle and actually win the darn golden statue outright.
12608	3	a	While Logan Lucky gives off the impression of a shaggy character-based comedy, such an assessment shortchanges how deliriously clever it is.
12609	7	a	Not since the schmaltzy Bucket List has there been a more blatant example of checklist comedy than the ultra-raunchy The To Do List.
12610	3	a	Gibson's passion is all over this film...but his resorting to mawkish, superficial tactics blows the tone off-course from time to time.
12611	2	a	The inhospitability of the land emphasizes the spare precision of the narratives and helps to give them an atavistic power, as if they were tales that had been handed down since the beginning of time.
12612	1	a	The movie these guys have come up with is fresh, funny and a bewildering surprise.
12613	1	a	Doesn't quite live up to its immediate predecessor, Hot Fuzz, but handily bests the first film, Shaun of the Dead.
12614	4	a	The film is thankfully shorn of the sentimentality which weighed down The Fault in Our Stars.
12615	3	a	Silly, lighthearted, funny - and despite a slow start, ultimately charms its target audience.
12616	7	a	This inspired-by-reality tale is essentially an emotional snuff film. It's the kind of misguided effort a middle-aged director indulges in when he wants to reinvent himself as edgy. 
12617	3	a	Spielberg's dreamy love letter to pop culture is a pure joy to take in, hypnotic and grin-inducing in its references, with an unadulterated sense of magic.
12618	5	a	Unlike the game, this gore-heavy and moronic science-fiction thriller doesn't feature a player-control aspect. So there's no way to skip past the early dull moments, or to end the game -- er, movie -- early.
12619	1	a	Imagine - a romantic comedy that's actually both. It's been a long, long time.
12620	3	a	A quintessentially European, methodically paced and intelligent slice of life.
12621	1	a	Even when the violence gets out of control, as bad as 'a bad day in Bosnia,' there's an underlying level of wit and humor.
12622	9	a	Cheap and cheerless, it all resembles a supermarket own-brand version of similar but much superior fare such as A Bug's Life, making you wish for a plague of spiders to put them out of their - and our - misery.
12623	3	a	The screen romance of Film Stars Don't Die in Liverpool may seem as odd as the real-life pairing was, but it's a credit to all concerned that the validity of it is never in doubt.
12624	3	a	Call Me by Your Name sees Italian filmmaker Luca Guadagnino do his home country proud with an absolutely gorgeous depiction of the northern Italian countryside.
12625	1	a	Forest Whitaker is superb in the title role. THE RZA's score is sublime. Heck, even director Jarmusch deserves kudos for this one.
12626	5	a	Cianfrance is far more concerned with mood than he is with logic, and his movies -- to me, anyway -- continue to suffer because of his choices.
12627	5	a	Hugh Grant and Sandra Bullock basically play their patented movie selves in this overly familiar romantic comedy about corporate greed, social responsibility, personal promises and budding love.
12628	4	a	Del Toro takes his time to get to the violence, but he never let go the audience and captures their attention with a magical and gothic aesthetic. [Full review in Spanish]
12629	5	a	If counting sheep doesn't cure your insomnia, this film certainly will.
12630	3	a	The Infiltrator is a true-crime story, familiar but compelling, about false identities, affording Cranston the chance to play a man who is pretending to be another, more swaggering, more dangerous man.
12631	4	a	Wrong Turn has plenty of bad -ations: decapitation, mutilation, evisceration. But it's got an unexpectedly fun -ation - its hillbilly variation on Panic Room.
12632	9	a	The most derivative movie of the year, and also one of the worst. It doesn't have a single element that wasn't already a part of another, better movie
12633	2	a	With the help of Reilly and Silverman's performances, Ralph Breaks the Internet brings more compassion than you're likely to see the next ten times you go online.
12634	6	a	Chalk this one up as a close one, a bold attempt by a McGregor, but a near miss.
12635	4	a	The rather startling way in which the film deflates is enough to ensure that for most viewers, this third trip will be the least charming.
12636	5	a	The film carries us along on a journey with people you would never want to have in your carpool.
12637	8	a	Demeaning both to believers and to unbelievers, and for the same reason: It stacks the deck too heavily in one direction.
12638	3	a	An intriguing, good-looking movie, and character-driven in the best sense. But truly, it's fanciful.
12639	5	a	Failure to Launch stumbles its way to a happy ending without generating either much romance or comedy.
12640	0	a	Straw Dogs serves as the director's blistering treatise on man's inherent animalistic impulses.
12641	6	a	An outside perspective is exactly what this movie needs toward the end as Shakur's grip on his identity becomes shaky. 
12642	4	a	Sweet but slow tale about the power of family, imagination. 
12643	6	a	There's precious little sense of adventure, suspense or excitement and no sense of fun.
12644	0	a	The real triumph of The Hobbit is that Peter Jackson leaves you wanting more.
12645	6	a	...from the first half hour through the final, unbelievably dull moment, the film beats its audience over the head with the same, tired moral.
12646	9	a	"Plays like one of those conversations that Comic Book Guy on ""The Simpsons"" has."
12647	5	a	Might this be the final Final Destination? Don't bet on it.
12648	5	a	Predictable romance has teen sex, drinking.
12649	10	a	Any resemblance to comedy is purely coincidental and unintentional. The only reason to chuckle is to prove you haven't died while watching it. Its credits should be handed to a mercenary. It's not a film. It's the Zeroes' worst pop-culture excretion.
12650	3	a	[Matchstick Men] is more memorable for Lohman's naturalistic acting and Scott's mannerist direction than it is for its O. Henry surprise.
12651	3	a	A nice, straightforward, good old-fashioned geopolitical conspiracy thriller with no pretentions.
12652	0	a	is transmuted . . .intact to the big screen with creator Joss Whedon at the controls, the original cast in place, and all of them in perfect form. 
12653	4	a	I did expect there to be a stronger emotional connection between Ricci and Jackson, but that said, the two actors were impressive to watch.
12654	4	a	A cleverly constructed story of intellectual weight and genuine intrigue.
12655	3	a	A smart, savvy film that forces you to think.
12656	5	a	For Pixar prodigy Andrew Stanton directing and co-writing, it was obviously a labour of love. But for two hours, as with any problem birth, we get more labour than love.
12657	4	a	There is art here, and amusement to be had. But most of it is of an arch and trifling nature, as lasting as a chemical rush and ephemeral as smoke.
12658	3	a	Fun-filled, oddball British vampire flick
12659	1	a	A haunting and mesmerizing film.
12660	5	a	... worthy intentions are far outstripped by its fumbling amateurishness.
12661	3	a	You won't come out unscathed from this rewarding ride, thanks to an outstanding script and some sensational performances. [Full review in Spanish]
12662	0	a	The self-explanatory title of this campy disaster flick represents a rare case of cinematic truth-in-advertising, because it's all about snakes on a plane.
12663	4	a	A thriller typically is only as good as its villain, and too many of them are bloodless here. Except for the hot-blooded performance of Smith... the movie is cool, right down to its color scheme.
12664	2	a	... it coaxes us to be more open to each other, more compassionate, and more loving.
12665	3	a	There's no plot to get in the way of the stunts in this 'movie', but it's absolutely hilarious for fans of the twisted show.
12666	0	a	Accessible ... .
12667	6	a	With all of Shults' dark-night-of-the-soul mood manipulations, the film promises more than it delivers. Its buildups are impressive, but in the end its frights are mild.
12668	2	a	Hoffman and Linney's great skill shows in their picking up on the nuances of sibling hierarchy and habits borne of years and familiarity.
12669	5	a	There's simply no center here, no sense that someone is guiding the ship.
12670	9	a	"Even Samuel L. Jackson's performance can't save this glorified press release from its ""been there, done that"" fate."
12671	3	a	"The horror that real-life parents survive every day is far too frightening for any movie monster, but ""Friends With Kids"" unearths humor amid all the gory details."
12672	0	a	Freaky, lovely and very frightening.
12673	3	a	Serenity is made of dubious but energetic special effects, breathless velocity, much imagination, some sly verbal wit and a little political satire.
12674	4	a	Arriving so soon after the excellent 'Me and Earl and the Dying Girl,' it can't help but pale in comparison but that's not really fair.
12675	9	a	Based on lame book about sexual experimentation, the movie fares about as well.
12676	3	a	Tennessee Williams adapted his play in this provocative black comedy, directed with intensity by Kazan, and starring Carroll Baker in her Oscar-nominate performance as the child-bride.
12677	3	a	Evocative, empathetic and elegiac - a captivating, contemporary Western.
12678	3	a	While Nurse Betty isn't quite the sum of its such impeccable parts, Zellweger's incredibly earnest, enthusiastic performance ties it all together in a way no other actress could.
12679	4	a	Complex psychological thriller about a terrorizing NYC cop gone amok.
12680	7	a	This is the last one in this long dead franchise...unless they do something stupid.
12681	0	a	When you stop looking at the forest, you'll see the beauty in the trees.
12682	4	a	Anyone who's seen Titan A.E. will have a hard time not feeling deja vu, even though Disney's effort is slightly better.
12683	6	a	There's some very funny stuff on the margins, but overall it's pretty weak.
12684	4	a	What distinguishes this better than half-decent comedy is its detailed insight into the bee brain
12685	6	a	The film was actually never boring for me, but neither was it ever exciting.
12686	6	a	So straight and formal there's no room to breathe.
12687	5	a	While there are occasional funny bits, the question remains: Why should you go see this movie instead of its competitors? The answer is: You shouldn't.
12688	3	a	A satisfying adrenaline rush, it is a mindless bit of escapism that speaks to the inner teenage rebel in us all.
12689	2	a	The actors...bring out an attractive, warmhearted simplicity in each character. Above all, they portray a close, loving family, the film's ultimate and lasting virtue.
12690	3	a	This combination of whimsy and romance is, for me, much more successful than Allen's previous European city film, Vicky Cristina Barcelona.
12691	3	a	it's very easy to get lost in this silly, fun adventure tale.
12692	2	a	In Gridlock'd, an oddly effective combination of gritty drama and social satire, Shakur and his co-star Tim Roth take sketchy characters and make them exciting to watch through the pure energy of their talent and chemistry.
12693	4	a	Larry Crowne is a glass-is-half-full kind of movie if there ever was one.
12694	3	a	A Lawrence-Kasdan directed dramody about how a lost dog helps a long-married couple find their way back to each other.
12695	6	a	Children and Republicans may benefit from its message, but Arctic Tale isn't to be trusted, though not for any reason having to do with its thoughts on climate change.
12696	4	a	It's a gorgeous celebration of movement for movement's sake, color for color's sake, and athleticism for athleticism's sake.
12697	4	a	Cheerful family-com.
12698	10	a	Virtually everything in the movie is off-pitch.
12699	2	a	"Significant as both history and film art, this gloomy tale has no ""convenient"" villains and refuses to indulge in stereotypes, instead focusing on larger forces, such as racism and political apathy."
12700	3	a	One of those rare titles that has improved with age.
12701	2	a	Boseman is an actor of exceptional ability and magnetism, and he works as hard as the man he is playing to convey the power of Brown's stage presence.
12702	5	a	Unfortunately, it's not a great film. But it's an enjoyable one, if you like fine wine, beautiful countrysides, and a little frisson of flirtation.
12703	3	a	If there were an ounce of taste left in Hollywood, the magnificent Vera Farmiga would be a front-runner for the Best Actress Oscar.
12704	2	a	Offers a surprisingly touching and simple story about human dignity in the most trying of circumstances.
12705	7	a	"Could they not have come up with anything but lumpish, vulgar humor and dumb ""Focker"" puns?"
12706	3	a	Strikes a unique balance between coming-of-age charm, comedy, and honest drama, and it's the constant give and take between all three that makes the film as a whole both pleasantly enchanting and quite poignant, too.
12707	6	a	Poor Pattinson does the best he can. He's not terrible. But he's definitely out of his element, if not beyond his depth, an altar boy in a bishop's robes.
12708	3	a	"Mix ""A People's History of the United States"" with ""Caligula,"" a stoner comedy and a slasher flick - then animate the results - and you've got the essence of the thing."
12709	4	a	Not a good movie or a consistently solid action flick, but it is a big step up. I guess that's not much of a compliment considering what it is an improvement over, but take it for what it's worth.
12710	6	a	In story terms, its cavalcade of melodrama and conflict isn't always persuasive, but writer-director Darnell Martin's respect for the music shines through.
12711	3	a	Thoroughly delightful and entertaining, this is exactly the type of movie Walt Disney would make if he were alive today.
12712	9	a	The movie's R rating mentions 'intense terror violence and gore,' but only its publicity team could consider it intense or terrifying. Gore it has.
12713	4	a	"With the latest threat of political scandal in the US comes the constant comparison, in the news media, with the Watergate scandal, making ""Mark Felt"" timely in an odd way."
12714	9	a	Here is a movie that seems at war with the notion that animation can inspire or invigorate.
12715	2	a	Great dramatic acting by the three lead women, and it's fantastic to see Samuel L. Jackson back in a strong supporting role. 
12716	2	a	It's high-minded, dealing in heady truths about life, art, narcissism, creativity and spirituality. It's subtitled. Everyone speaks Italian. Also, nothing explodes.
12717	7	a	tiresome and humdrum instead of thrilling
12718	5	a	Ms. Wilde could hold our attention needlepointing the Periodic Table, but having our dream fulfilled to see her go all 'Carrie' couldn't breathe life into this misfire.
12719	1	a	In profiling a man who frustrates everyone around him, the film is as realistically ambiguous as it is satisfying.
12720	3	a	A modern-day slasher pic that is a step above most in the genre.
12721	5	a	The contrivances pile up more quickly than snowfall in a Buffalo winter, and the ending is so lame that it provoked guffaws from theater-goers attending the screening along with me.
12722	3	a	Francis McDormand anchors an excellent drama about flawed folks dealing in futile ways good and bad with understandable anger. 
12723	4	a	Does Bee survive the hype? Not quite, but it is semi-charming and reasonably clever in that facile Dreamworks Animation kind of way.
12724	1	a	...a stellar entry within Schrader's admittedly rocky body of work. 
12725	2	a	like a screwball comedy filtered through a student thesis project, but it's nothing if not original
12726	1	a	As actor and director, Penn long has been drawn to the existential and elemental. Life and death. Remorse and revenge. All these themes converge -- symphonically -- in Into the Wild, his most fully realized work as a director.
12727	6	a	[Brody] can be proud of his work here, and the movie is better than just a pre-stardom curiosity.
12728	5	a	There's no story to tell until the thing happens, and once it happens, it's over in a few minutes. It's not a movie, it's an anecdote. 
12729	9	a	Just an overextended historical pageant: lifeless tableaux, assembled under the mistaken impression that bigger and longer is the same as important and interesting.
12730	4	a	There's actually a lot going on in this little movie, and first-time feature director Stephen Daldry ... handles all of it deftly.
12731	1	a	Eastwood's modest approach to these momentous events shames the usual Hollywood showboating. In a rare achievement, he's made a film that truly is good for the soul.
12732	4	a	An entertaining thriller that eschews most of the usual spy gimmicks in favour of old-fashioned sleuthing.
12733	6	a	This Agora is an expensive-looking update on an old De Mille-style extravaganza. It has many new and provocative ideas, certainly, but the same British accents and the same stodgy execution.
12734	3	a	Messy but mesmerizing.
12735	4	a	Jack Goes Boating is extremely well-acted and full of moments I adored, it's just the final product itself that sadly left me cold.
12736	3	a	Filled with the director's characteristically sardonic humor, but it's fundamentally a serious movie interested in the intricacies of the human condition. 
12737	6	a	...mostly involves sermonizing of the stultifying kind.
12738	1	a	Some critics love to tear down a crowd-pleasing contender. Don't let them sway you. American Hustle is a good-time holiday movie.
12739	4	a	This enjoyably OTT drama-with-songs-in-it was monstered in January by American reviewers, who were maybe expecting a highbrow, subtle and meditative drama in which Gwyneth Paltrow is an alcoholic banjo player.
12740	0	a	An absolutely amazing movie, as subversive as it gets. It's a wonder it ever got made, especially by a major studio.
12741	2	a	If you can get past the lack of significant dialogue then you will find a touching tale of one man's journey -- a journey that can teach us all a little bit about ourselves.
12742	4	a	Despite a story predictable enough to make The Sound of Music play like a nail-biting thriller, its heart is so much in the right place it is difficult to get really peeved at it.
12743	4	a	The film continually halts the action to repeat the plot to us, sometimes word for word.
12744	1	a	What makes this one of the year's most notable movies, is the way DuVernay cuts through the immense mythology to delve into King's brilliant political mind. 
12745	1	a	Not since David Cronenberg have surgery, sex and violence frolicked in the same stained bed so skillfully. 
12746	2	a	After the success of Ted, Seth MacFarlane gives himself his first leading-man role in this hilarious but overlong comedy-Western. 
12747	4	a	An exciting film even though Cianfrance fails to develop it with all the profusion it deserves. [Full review in Spanish]
12748	5	a	Nothing fresh is brought to the screen and the stars end up treading water with well-worn cliches.
12749	2	a	As with the original film, there's little to offend the most myopic fan of the books, but also little room for the imaginative extension of the author's universe that distinguishes an inspired adaptation from a merely workmanlike one.
12750	4	a	The story of a gruelling trek through sub-zero temperatures that is both visually stunning and dramatically chilly.
12751	2	a	Lohman and Cage generate the warmest moments ever felt in a Ridley Scott movie.
12752	3	a	Exuberant, enormously funny.
12753	6	a	It's not as bad as Sphere but...
12754	3	a	"The Hobbit"" becomes what it was originally meant to be - not a cut-from-the-same-cloth prequel, but its own, individual thing."
12755	5	a	However, among solid performances, beautiful locations, and a truly harrowing journey, this film left me feeling empty.
12756	3	a	Sayles, a rare screenwriter who consistently creates thoughtful roles for grown-up women, has outdone himself here.
12757	3	a	Ahead of its day when released Bakshi animation
12758	10	a	The problem with an action hero who banks largely on the extent to which he thinks things are boring is that, after a certain point, the audience will agree.
12759	7	a	The gags are hit-and-miss, and regardless of their success, they categorically go on too long.
12760	4	a	The screenplay from Jez and John-Henry Butterworth inserts some actual discussion of his songwriting and groove technique, giving the man credit for virtually inventing the funk.
12761	6	a	The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford adds another gauzy chapter to the overtaxed James myth, if not much rhyme or reason, heart or soul.
12762	1	a	"It's no ""Pan's Labyrinth,"" but it is as intricately, astoundingly designed and as entertaining as del Toro's ""Hellboy II: The Golden Army."
12763	0	a	"Selma"" invites viewers to heed its story, meditate on its implications and allow those images once again to change our hearts and minds."
12764	3	a	Reign of Fire is one of the most intense and enjoyable monster flicks I've ever seen. 
12765	4	a	It feels like something Dali would have dreamed up after imbibing a bottle of absinthe and choking on a ham sandwich.
12766	3	a	"The Light Between Oceans"" hangs on the screen like a large, lovely painting in a beautiful old frame."
12767	5	a	What should have been a painless time-killer becomes instead a grating endurance test.
12768	0	a	Only time can tell which movies become classics. No matter how many Ds you see it in, it's safe to say that this one has earned the label. 
12769	2	a	It is on Philip Seymour Hoffman's shoulders that much of the film sits, and his disheveled, cigarette-fueled German spy character provides another of his inimitable sad-sack characters that he brings to the screen better than pretty much anyone.
12770	3	a	A caffeinated exercise in nonsequitur metaphysics...
12771	4	a	It remains a rare franchise reboot where the sense of playfulness outweighs that of strained psychological depth or grim commercial obligation.
12772	5	a	"If you're going to a see a nearly three-hour movie based on a fraction of a popular book, make it ""Lincoln"" "
12773	6	a	Watch the trailer, skip the movie
12774	5	a	...a marketing hook first and a movie ... well, actually, never.
12775	9	a	Zombie's attempted post-modernism has neither the intelligence nor the conviction to work: he may fancy himself a genuine devil, but he comes off here as a poseur of a cheap and low order.
12776	6	a	RKO's Western is simple but entertaining and it's fun to see the Duke, who enjoys good chemistry with the tough and sexy Ella Raines just before he became a box-office star.
12777	5	a	It's not without its charms and you could certainly do worse, but don't expect too much from The Super.
12778	3	a	[There's] a brilliant and unnervingly timely exchange.
12779	5	a	It's hard to begrudge such an earnest endeavour, but this is missing the wit, nuance, and insight of a book thought by many - correctly, maybe - to be unadaptable.
12780	9	a	It's the usual quick-cut, this-is-all-we-can-show-you R-rated mayhem.
12781	5	a	Carries the unfortunate burden of echoing other, better films. 
12782	0	a	It wasn't until the final shot of Carol that I realized how tightly the film had wrapped me in its web.
12783	0	a	Could this be Ethan Hawke's Oscar?
12784	0	a	A new American classic.
12785	3	a	The film is novelistic in its nuance, in the patience of its storytelling and in the complexity of its mostly unhappy characters.
12786	4	a	An action farce that's on the stale side of banter-heavy cop high jinks.
12787	4	a	"In the feature-length soap opera ""Mother and Child,"" writer-director Rodrigo Garcia creates a multiple narrative about women, the choices - sometimes forced upon them - that they make regarding childbirth and the manifold repercussions."
12788	2	a	Writer/director Brian Hecker has an impressive grasp on his material, from the swinging soundtrack to the old-school setting.
12789	0	a	Dujardin is as charismatic a lead as Gene Kelly ever was, and Bejo is the perfect, irresistible foil for ageing megastar George Valentin. In support, John Goodman is perfectly cast.
12790	4	a	...a diverting game of spot-the-reference...
12791	7	a	Seventy-three minutes, not counting the end credits. It may take longer driving to and from the theater... Normally such brevity is welcome, especially with Westerns since Kevin Costner already thinned our patience, three hours at a time.
12792	1	a	Thanks to Smith, it's a story about movie stars -- and why the multiplex-going humankind needs to have them kicking around, too.
12793	6	a	True love draws blood, or so the film's awkward metaphor goes. Breakin' All the Rules leaves little more than a hickey.
12794	9	a	Watch the opening for Bruce Campbell's death scene, and then run far away.
12795	3	a	It's a hodgepodge of spills, pranks, and wide-eyed reaction shots, sold with Feig's fine-tuned, Hughesian comedic voice.
12796	1	a	Laurel Canyon's end isn't entirely satisfying, but the story works.
12797	5	a	Shore's contempt extends well beyond himself to tar his fans and just about anyone who might be in the audience.
12798	3	a	Wonderfully mysterious and emotionally draining.
12799	9	a	A family fantasy that plays at being happy and picture-perfect but primarily comes off as fake and dismayingly unfunny.
12800	6	a	While Eat Pray Love has some enlightening, touching, visually breathtaking moments, you still end up praying it would end.
12801	3	a	Skyfall stands out by bringing Bond into a real world milieu. For many reasons, things aren't so comfortable and secure anymore.
12802	1	a	The unbeatable Oscar-winning combination of legendary Spanish writer/director Pedro Almodovar and international superstar beauty Penelope Cruz makes this lavishly mounted melodrama a cinematic gem.
12803	3	a	Alpha Dog is about people acting on impulse and slowly making things worse and worse.
12804	5	a	Save for its basis in historical reality, there is little that is original in the visualizing of Wonderland's underbelly tour of compromised lives.
12805	5	a	Like a bottle of lukewarm Champagne -- an expensive one, judging by the label -- America's Sweethearts opens with a promising burst of effervescence and quickly goes flat.
12806	6	a	Golden's straightforwardly involving prose, while no great shakes, has been replaced by an extremely fussy affair that is, in effect, its own silk-wrapped pictorial novelization.
12807	0	a	Exquisite...a small film, but it's like a flawless gem with endless facets to explore and appreciate.
12808	6	a	Unremarkable, predictable and forgettable, slotting its real-life main character into a familiar formula.
12809	4	a	The film's bittersweet conclusion is strong enough to provide real narrative impetus for the inevitable sequel.
12810	1	a	Adding in some timely social commentary and a healthy dash of self-awareness. What results is a comedy that's even better than its predecessor.
12811	3	a	Rarely have six hours spent doing anything seemed so rewarding.
12812	0	a	The best Scorsese film directed by David O. Russell.
12813	3	a	Mara displays fondness and disinterest so naturally you can swear you know exactly what the character's thinking without her actually saying anything.
12814	4	a	MacFarlane is grasping at something profound with his screenplay, and every attempt he makes to say something relevant is undercut by the inevitable rude or racist joke.
12815	9	a	Weak and unmemorable.
12816	6	a	If it just didn't star Spade, ...
12817	5	a	The latest in a tiresome stream of adaptations of old television shows.
12818	4	a	It's the wily blending of opposing concepts - science vs faith; chance vs destiny; mortality vs spirituality - that gives considerable intellectual muscle to an unusual mix of mystery and love story. 
12819	4	a	A bit like cheap champagne: It's better if you revel in its bubbly fizz and don't think about the finish.
12820	9	a	...do not under any circumstances rent this if you've never seen the Highlander TV series.
12821	4	a	There's nothing glaringly wrong with Ixcanul, it's just hard to get whipped up for stoicism.
12822	4	a	Doesn't soar to new heights but doesn't crash and burn either.
12823	4	a	Unfortunately, its surprise release is the most interesting thing about The Cloverfield Paradox
12824	4	a	War of the Worlds shows that Steven Spielberg remains one of the best shooters in Hollywood.
12825	3	a	McConaughey's performance as Joe, the psychopath killer with some extreme sexual fetishes, is particularly impressive.
12826	2	a	An impressive, sharply written and acted coming-of-age flick. 
12827	5	a	A heartfelt but badly unfocused slice-of-urban life from Spike Lee. Depressingly typical of the director's efforts of late.
12828	5	a	While the subject is very timely and worthy, this lame tale just falls completely flat.
12829	0	a	The screenplay is so dense and nuanced, the characters so textured and conflicted, the plot so tight and twisty that American Hustle achieves a dramatic reality of documentary proportions.
12830	5	a	The movie's lack of Michael Moore-style dynamism has a dulling effect.
12831	3	a	An animated farce with... uproarious action
12832	2	a	Even if The Ring has a familiar ring, it's still unusually crafty and intelligent for Hollywood horror.
12833	4	a	A movie of its kind and of its time -- functional, professional, slickly manufactured and slouching toward consciousness -- I, Robot is a perfect slave to mechanical convention.
12834	2	a	Strong performances from Vera Farmiga and Hugh Dillon keep things from becoming overdramatic.
12835	4	a	"Carter"" is so good-natured, and so goofy, that it's hard to completely dislike. But impossible, I think, to understand."
12836	5	a	If you think sweltering UV rays, deadly sandstorms and dwindling water sources are bad, you haven't had to contend with Giovanni Ribisi's heinous new bleach blond hair
12837	5	a	Quite a bit less than the sum of its appealing parts.
12838	6	a	"While the situations are real and the dialogue is authentic, ""The Break-Up"" is mundane and trite."
12839	3	a	Max Payne is a junkyard dog of a film that is true to its video-game roots even as it transcends them.
12840	9	a	All Spielberg achieved is an impressive production design; in every other department, he's profoundly wasted talent, material, and time.
12841	5	a	Had a lot going for it, but its tedious pace killed the picture.
12842	4	a	Delivers something worthwhile to those open-minded enough to be able to settle with wild shifts between average satire and grounded pathos
12843	7	a	a rather an insipid bit of lazy filmmaking
12844	4	a	It has little to say about humanity in general, or even Valentino specifically, but it is fun and glitzy.
12845	5	a	It's a difficult assignment to pull all the genre strings into a tight ball of serio-comedic yarn. My cat Hillary could have done a better job with less effort.
12846	2	a	That's what Katzelmacher is: a punishment, via art, leveled at all the ignorant, egotistical racists Fassbinder had known.
12847	9	a	A-ca-trocious.
12848	3	a	What separates this from a pack of high school dramas is the isolation everyone feels, as well as the lack of sensationalism when it comes to portraying their acts of rebellion.
12849	4	a	The movie is above all a lovely travelogue, plunging us viscerally into the middle of every country.
12850	9	a	Spielbergian sentimentality at its ickiest
12851	2	a	Twohy lets his story's central guessing game play out with patient tautness.
12852	8	a	Wimmer delivers the already labored story with the subtlety of a sledgehammer.
12853	5	a	Would have been terrible even if it managed to come out during the period of time when society might have been interested in it. Instead, it's both terrible and deeply pathetic.
12854	6	a	There's some amusing mischief as the underage passengers outsmart the grownups, but the picture also features mean-spirited stereotypes that kill the festive mood. Talk about holiday blahs.
12855	3	a	Jennifer Aniston is the essential girl next door in this down-to-earth, witty film of small town desperation.
12856	4	a	If only a little of the resources had been spent on a good script, Shanghai Noon might have been the great Jackie Chan movie his fans have been waiting for.
12857	4	a	This eagerly anticipated sequel was never going to have the same impact as the original endeavour, but as long as you bear that in mind there is plenty to take away, for there is no doubting this picture carries that same, familiar swagger.
12858	3	a	The whole thing comes together to form the best Burt Reynolds movie he never made.
12859	9	a	The execution of the material appears to be just a bit too lacking to serve the purpose of a full-length film.
12860	6	a	Over and over How Do You Know kept shooting itself in the foot, butchering my interest and demolishing my emotional investment to the point I almost wondered why I was still sitting in the theatre watching it.
12861	6	a	While We Have a Pope contains an interesting idea for a film, it ultimately fails to portray the struggle Cardinal Melville is going through, which is the centerpiece of the entire film.
12862	0	a	It's a vast, sweeping epic that thrillingly sets its characters' lives against a wider backdrop of profound political, historical, and cultural change.
12863	6	a	There's not a scrap of Milne left, at this point.
12864	4	a	The usual bang, boom, crunch and screech, though maybe a little more stylishly executed than most.
12865	9	a	Unwatchable because of a stupid story, its painfully obvious plot twists, bad acting and terrible special effects.
12866	3	a	Director Paul Greengrass actually has a better sense of pacing than his predecessor, Doug Liman.
12867	9	a	I thought I was watching the Challenger disaster instead of a romantic comedy.
12868	6	a	A bit clumsy for a film that too often tries to jump from slapstick to drama to action thriller.
12869	5	a	As we have come to learn -- as many times as we have fingers to count on -- Jason is a killer who doesn't know the meaning of the word 'quit.' The filmmakers might want to look it up.
12870	4	a	Stylish but shallow, this could be the director's next franchise, along with Eleven and Magic Mike.
12871	3	a	Loved Stand By Me? This is for you. The Kings Of Summer is absolutely wonderful, a welcome gift for moviegoers and a true gem in a season of non-stop mayhem. Don't Miss it.
12872	5	a	Re-watch value is extremely low with this one.
12873	5	a	I think the film is a mess. Even though I was there where and when it was filmed, and I went through some of the same stuff these characters did, I couldn't relate to it.
12874	3	a	They could have easily made yet another gross-out comedy, but instead the laughs are born of clever writing and likable characters.
12875	5	a	A formulaic picture that's entertaining enough, but makes you wonder if Li will ever duplicate his success in Asia in the States.
12876	9	a	Do the producers of this overdone trilogy understand the concept of 'final'?
12877	2	a	A tasty matinee snack.
12878	2	a	In the future, all manner of society's ills in the future will be blamed on this movie. [But] this is a film that exposes evil, not one that glorifies it.
12879	5	a	a bunch of confused skaters trapped in an existentialist Nouvelle Vague film
12880	3	a	...captivating, filled with a myriad of small, humorous, wicked touches that continually please.
12881	9	a	Does one really have to so debase Christ's story in order to make it relevant to today's audiences?
12882	6	a	Talk to Me is an incisive portrait of a provocative figure. It comes very close to caricature, but remains human and lively.
12883	4	a	It succeeds in engaging the mibd, but never really touches the heart.
12884	3	a	In First Reformed, depression arises from one's lack of impact, whether that be through inactivity or a lack of tangible results.
12885	3	a	This is a powerful film.
12886	3	a	The general bleakness of the film, its themes and the author's youthful anger could not be erased with digital technology.
12887	6	a	Director Andrew Stanton, making his first live-action feature after the successful Pixar animated films FINDING NEMO and WALL-E, hasn't been able to bring anything very new to the familiar story of battles among rival forces on another planet:
12888	5	a	A too-passive lead character sinks this otherwise interesting film.
12889	8	a	A slapsticky buddy action-comedy so bad that it's hard to decide who's dumber: the two guards at the center of things or the filmmakers who've put them there.
12890	3	a	Totally charming. Aubrey Plaza and Mark Duplass make a wonderful pair. This has real sleeper potential. 
12891	3	a	The movie feels like a cartoon, brilliantly achieved but utterly shallow.
12892	5	a	The moment in any family film when dignity goes out the window is an animal reaction shot.
12893	4	a	Kim feels substantially drawn thanks to Fey's sterling work, but Whiskey Tango Foxtrot is much less successful in the portrayal of its supporting players, many of whom are amalgamations of real people.
12894	10	a	Jolie's performance vanishes somewhere between her hair and her lips.
12895	0	a	"The house of Flying Daggers"" is to a kung fu flick what grand opera is to karaoki."
12896	7	a	The Good Girl remains so shockingly drained of verve that it actually renders the audience into a numb stupor.
12897	4	a	...the scares go top-notch thanks to a creepy performance by young Jodelle Ferland.
12898	0	a	Spielberg has gone on to weightier and more prestigious projects, but this thrill ride is one of his best and a masterpiece of the genre.
12899	3	a	...compelling, surprisingly non-expoitative...
12900	6	a	A noisy, not particularly charming collection of skits and skirmishes.
12901	8	a	Mirrors the plot of the original point for point. All that's missing is little things like subtlety, nuance, characterization, and human interest.
12902	2	a	It is a superbly written movie ... featuring terrific characters who are played by one of the most talented casts of the year.
12903	1	a	Darkly hilarious, Tamara Jenkins' The Savages captures the cruel demographic joke facing many boomers who are forced to take care of aging parents at a point when they haven't entirely figured out their own lives.
12904	4	a	Wristcutters: A Love Story is a twee little movie that may have appeal for a cult audience but few others. And I bet that cult will wind up growing from its affection for the film before long.
12905	4	a	It's hard to name an actor more versed at elevating pulp material to a stylish level than Johnny Depp.
12906	5	a	Nearly every joke lays an egg.
12907	1	a	There's plenty of blood, most of the cast of thousands die, and some of the images are just plain disturbing...I loved it.
12908	4	a	Not as arty as The American or Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy or as soapy and quickly paced as its small screen counterparts, A Most Wanted Man is left somewhere in the middle.
12909	2	a	It's beautiful, it's funny, it's colorful. But somehow the magic isn't exactly there in full measure.
12910	3	a	It has more of a sting than you might think.
12911	6	a	"Unfortunately, Lucy Walker's ""Buena Vista Social Club: Adios"" plays more like a well-intentioned but unsatisfying addendum to Wenders' movie and Cooder's recording."
12912	4	a	Great story, bad idea for a movie.
12913	6	a	In places the plot sags a bit and some jokes don't quite hit their mark or tickle the funny bone as much as they're obviously meant to.
12914	2	a	The movie is gentle and sweet. Nothing more. Nothing less. And told most poetically.
12915	5	a	little more than a self-indulgent wallow in white upper-class privilege feigning depth by cloaking itself in fortune cookie wisdom
12916	6	a	Cukor's trashy melodrama about the sex lives of L.A. housewives suffered due to censorship, but it's worth seeing for Claire Bloom's performance as a nymphomaniac; Shelley Winters and Jane Fonda co-star
12917	4	a	By mid-film, American Pastoral has all the anticipation of watching water circling around a drain that quickly disappears.
12918	6	a	Patsy Cline. Loretta Lynn. Gwyneth Paltrow.
12919	5	a	The rising dread is hobbled by a huge impediment: The story doesn't make a lick of sense.
12920	2	a	Forget divining who's predator and who's prey. Everybody's chum here.
12921	3	a	Paranoid Park is a haunting, voluptuously beautiful portrait of a teenage boy who, after being suddenly caught in midflight, falls to earth.
12922	3	a	All the performances are strong, but McDormand, Bale and Nivola's are most powerful.
12923	3	a	An acquired taste, Maddin is an unusually precise director who leaves little to chance. Whether one finds his approach too careful or just stunningly controlled will be up to individual cineastes.
12924	4	a	An intelligent and modestly-scaled thriller which, if it doesn't quite recall the classic Hollywood days of yore, it comes desperately close.
12925	4	a	A more coherent and romantic script.
12926	4	a	Intriguing yet ineffably sad, what emerges is not the story of an ape who failed to be human, but a story of human failings.
12927	5	a	There's something fascinating about this behavioral puzzle, yet the production seems apprehensive to find authentic beats of awakening, preferring to glaze down Quentin's crusade just when it's getting interesting.
12928	4	a	an amusing, sometimes witty, but often uneven comedy about the horrors of familial dysfunction
12929	1	a	Though heavy on the blood-letting, Gladiator serves as a smashing kick-start to what looks like an exciting summer for fans of high-powered action movies.
12930	1	a	Let's assume you are a person who never intends to see a doc about rap music, but might have it in you to see one. This is the one.
12931	6	a	Roth's most technically accomplished effort to date, yet despite the enthusiastic efforts of Black and Blanchett, it's all a bit too stodgy and low-energy.
12932	5	a	A fascinating public figure is reduced to an uninteresting, unlikeable cliche in this stylish but only fitfully entertaining biopic.
12933	5	a	Unaccompanied Minors is a Christmas headache looking for an audience.
12934	2	a	"Sayles is the ultimate ""on the other hand"" guy, which may make for more thoughtful understanding but which is difficult to translate to film, a medium better suited to the dynamic, the opinionated, and the one-sided."
12935	5	a	This is a dismal, dreary and fairly desperate movie, in which the actors try very hard but are unable to overcome an uninspired screenplay.
12936	5	a	The only genuine point of interest is seeing Charles Laughton get his wish to play the buffoon. 
12937	3	a	Enjoyable and funny and lovely to look at, not all we could ask from Allen, but the kind of fanciful and well-acted movie he still does better than anybody. 
12938	10	a	The worst movie I have seen this year.
12939	9	a	If you thought Depp went overboard with his Keith Richards impression in Pirates of the Caribbean, here he goes whole hog into the sty.
12940	3	a	"...The key to what makes ""I, Robot"" work is a well thought out script..."
12941	3	a	Those midnight excursions for Gil are what movies like this one are for us, an emotional vacation that, if we are lucky, inspires respite, clarity, and renewal. 
12942	7	a	"The Rover"" is a minimalist dystopian drama with more plot-holes than plot. "
12943	3	a	Sometimes, a movie just has a magic about it, something that makes you look past implausibility and plot holes and whatever other shortcomings it may have and leaves you feeling good just for having seen it.
12944	5	a	Spanning two decades and a momentous war, Memoirs of a Geisha displays all the pomp and grandeur of an epic, but you wouldn't call it sweeping.
12945	6	a	Despite some surprisingly decent performances, it just isn't as fun as it should be. But Stallone does prove there's still some room left in the action genre for these titans, so let's why not? Let's have another round.
12946	6	a	It kinda works and qualifies as cool at times, but is just too lame to work or be cool at others.
12947	4	a	I loved the idea -- and indeed its stunning visualisation... but that's not enough to sustain a film that is criminally overlong and wastes several opportunities to come to a close. Winslet, however, is fab.
12948	5	a	One of Spielberg's rare and true misfires. It's weirdly creepy when it's not being bombastically boring.
12949	4	a	Is there a market for self-consciously stylish movies about gangsters if the films operate in what seems like slow-motion?
12950	3	a	Paper Heart isn't terribly deep, but it's disarmingly sweet, and the various comic actors always work hard to keep things lively.
12951	6	a	Anyone old enough to go see this without a parent or guardian will have seen it all before.
12952	6	a	his [Nelson's] screenplay needs some serious re-working to show more of the dilemma, rather than have his characters stage shouting matches about it.
12953	6	a	Sedgwick's death seems as predestined as a Hollywood melodrama.
12954	6	a	The movie gleefully pushes boundaries, but it's a collection of a few worthy skit ideas and lots of non-starters in search of a unified whole.
12955	0	a	Yet another captivating, heartfelt, provocative and stylishly edited documentary from the brilliant James Marsh. 
12956	3	a	What this movie is about, and where it succeeds best, is the primordial level of fear.
12957	3	a	"It's probably too early to talk Oscar nominations, but when you're as good as Sally Field is in ""Hello, My Name Is Doris,"" it doesn't seem premature at all. "
12958	4	a	The most unbelievable element in Zhang's film is surprisingly enough the love story.
12959	4	a	The director is toying with us, he knows it, and he knows we know it. This isn't a dud, it's just a small disappointment.
12960	1	a	"The old-fashioned flavor of ""The Artist"" pays homage to what is considered the greatest silent film of all time, ""Sunrise,"" but makes its own niche in modern film."
12961	5	a	Everyone here is sour and detestable on some level, and though the film generates some chuckles and some interest due to its sheer quirkiness, we stare on in a freak-show kind of way.
12962	5	a	If there's anything truly scary about this time of year, it's the typical appearance of the ghastly beast known as the Sitcom Star Feature Hiatus Project.
12963	1	a	The acting is such a delight, with each actress nailing her respective personality type with appropriate flair and finesse, that it breathes with life.
12964	3	a	The concluding scenes of redemption and reunion are tender and transcendent. 
12965	5	a	Infused with a half-baked psychedelic ethos, incorporating some rather incongruous imagery that is supposed to tie in with its simple-minded politics regarding ideas of child rearing and gender roles.
12966	1	a	Enchanted charmingly reworks all the old [Disney] favorites while incorporating fresh twists of its own.
12967	1	a	This is the way that a biopic of a music legend should be brought to screen...full of music with Chadwick Boseman giving an award-quality performance lip-syncing to the iconic voice of James Brown.
12968	4	a	Bullets, knives and bare hands fly in an incomprehensible vortex as arms and heads and body parts get thrown into the melee.
12969	7	a	The result is a film that lacks the coherence, and the subsequent horror, of the Japanese oeuvre and made me just want to get the thing over with.
12970	4	a	Captive humans and exotic animals are an odd mix in mushy melodrama. 
12971	1	a	It's easily the best popcorn movie of the summer.
12972	4	a	Perhaps this will be the calling card that welcomes Shore back to fold... or maybe it's just a suitable farewell.
12973	4	a	All in all, it was a filling serve of empty-calorie laughs that left most undemanding viewers more than satisfied.
12974	5	a	...gratuitous violence at its most sublimely ridiculous.
12975	0	a	Resistance is futile.
12976	3	a	One more feather in the proudly proletarian cap of Ken Loach.
12977	3	a	Packed with crescendos and crap-outs, Peter Jackson's mega-bloated beginning to Bilbo Baggins' pilgrimage across Middle-earth to Lonely Mountain both awes and bores.
12978	3	a	The whole thing is so tasty, you may just want seconds.
12979	3	a	For me, this is the first movie of its kind in a very long time that I'd willingly sit through a second or even third time. 
12980	3	a	Terrific performances by the entire cast, especially Rudd and Wilson, make this romcom very entertaining, even though it's a bit too long
12981	4	a	The Wedding Date presents the curious case of two appealing performances surviving a bombardment of schlock.
12982	5	a	A solid cast can't save this soapy three-stranded London drama.
12983	3	a	[The film] serves as testament to Spielberg's gift as a pulse-riding, intuitively cinematic entertainer....a film full of grandly staged cyber battles and real-world intrigue. And thankfully it's one of the few long films to warrant its running time.
12984	6	a	There's nothing terribly fantastic about this ho-hum futuristic foray.
12985	4	a	Expect thrills, not a revolution.
12986	5	a	Must Love Dogs is finished with the cookie cutter; it's time to pass it on.
12987	4	a	Any movie that stars Steve Martin and Bonnie Hunt can't be all bad, and this one isn't.
12988	4	a	Hitchcock for dummies: brisk, jolly, well-played but oversimplified.
12989	4	a	Another subtle reminder of how much racial bigotry matters...
12990	6	a	Forster should be commended for attempting something as daunting as the overreaching Stay.
12991	3	a	There's no big shocker ending in Enchanted, and it follows a pretty typical formula, but what makes it a winner is its ability to make you smile anyway. Be forewarned, you might even get a cheek ache.
12992	0	a	Because this film touches us so deeply, the catharsis has a power that few -- if any -- other moments in film history can match.
12993	0	a	Ozu may have made subtler films, but the clarity of his social critique here is wrenching and unassailable.
12994	1	a	This isn't a made-for-video that they decided to put into theaters, but a version intended from the first to be theatrical. That's important, because it means more detail and complexity went into the animation.
12995	4	a	Desk Set is a big, shiny, doohickey coasting on the warm offerings of earlier triumphs.
12996	3	a	At their best, [Jackson and Jones] are merely two of the most cunning, commanding performers in all of movies.
12997	3	a	The Il Divo director returns to his native Rome for an exquisite blowout set amidst the ageing dilettantes living in the city's prosperous bohemian enclave.
12998	4	a	When it's funny, it's good. But when it takes a turn for the heartwarming, it feels more like a Disney knockoff than a send-up.
12999	5	a	The big question isn't whether middle-aged romance will bloom, but rather, how much sub-Jarmusch deadpan humor and pathos can you take?
13000	3	a	Grounding the over-the-top antics is the genuine suspense.
13001	4	a	A smart movie trapped in the body of a dead-end action flick.
13002	3	a	There can be beauty in tragedy, particularly when the key ingredient is the same in both
13003	6	a	It never answers the most important question: how did this film get a theatrical release and not go straight to DVD? Truly, some things man was not meant to know.
13004	0	a	This is one of the truly outstanding works of post-war European cinema.
13005	5	a	Astro Boy is one film unlikely to be given the sequels its good name previously deserved.
13006	4	a	A methodically paced, quietly moving experience.
13007	3	a	This is the sharpest, most reasonable tale of espionage and intrigue since John Boorman's Tailor of Panama.
13008	6	a	If there was a solitary new idea or actual emotion in Equilibrium, the Prozium must have rendered me oblivious.
13009	1	a	You'll be there, rooting for the lad with a smile -- and a tear or two.
13010	5	a	The director claims he had no intention of making an anti-Semitic film and we tend to believe him, in much the same way we believe Larry Flynt when he says he's not misogynist.
13011	5	a	There was just a growing emptiness that seemed to hang over its denouement...
13012	2	a	This trim adventure saga doesn't waste any time assigning heartwarming characteristics or backstories. It gets your heart pounding the old-fashioned way; it is exciting.
13013	7	a	Unbearably life affirming and quasi-spiritual... [Sharif] dispenses bromides like a watery-eyed, Middle-Eastern Forrest Gump.
13014	1	a	It's not exactly a caterpillar-to-butterfly tale. More like a grub to a beetle--a different kind of coming of age story, yet one that's oh so familiar as Nadine learns to appreciate the people right there at arm's reach.
13015	4	a	Not a great film but a good opening chapter... a film about a superhero family that's actually a family-friendly superhero film.
13016	1	a	The magic still sparkles in Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets.
13017	3	a	Busting with footage left in legal limbo for over three decades, Jeffrey Levy-Hinte's documentary is uproarious and uplifting.
13018	5	a	You're on the losing end from the opening bell
13019	6	a	Even if you can get past the acting -- and in the case of the beautiful, blank Alba, that's asking a lot -- the film just sits there, not exactly torturous, but never very exciting, either.
13020	3	a	Steinfeld's performance never sells short simple adolescent growing pains. It's the best combination of well-written ranting and genuine alienation in a high school comedy since Easy A.
13021	5	a	I can't see a kid today watching this movie and enjoying it.
13022	4	a	Guillermo del Toro doesn't merely direct movies. He paints them, dreams them, shapes them into private fantasies. Too much? Of course. But that's part of the fun.
13023	3	a	Clever and creepy as hell.
13024	1	a	Spielberg has crafted a genuinely traumatic summer event movie, one that gives us images of violence and destruction of often devastating emotional weight
13025	5	a	"Despite its obvious angling to become a franchise, this Green Hornet offers little that's worth committing to even the ""cult flick"" chamber of your brain."
13026	5	a	Roberts' character is difficult to feel sorry for before she sets off on this postcardperfect self-healing binge. She becomes near impossible to like as it becomes apparent we're watching a huge holiday video.
13027	2	a	a cinematic joy ride, an outrageous jaw dropper that explores serious themes under the guise of gaudy entertainment
13028	2	a	An epic, melancholic romance that employs a multi-generational cast and groundbreaking visual effects. It's a testament to Fincher's skill as a storyteller that the film actually works, albeit sporadically.
13029	3	a	[The film] brings the history very much to life.
13030	4	a	Skyfall is inconsistent, displaying Bond at its blandest and Bond at its best.
13031	6	a	McGregor's lack of experience behind camera can be seen in the scarcity of visual resources that replace the vigor of the written language of the novel. [Full review in Spanish]
13032	2	a	Unrestrained and shamelessly adorable, [Cage] invests his role as a twitchy, obsessive-compulsive con man with all the wildly gesticulating energy he can muster.
13033	1	a	A mystery at heart, about identity, fatherhood, religion and how early transistor radios transformed young people's lives. On that level, it is utterly engrossing.
13034	3	a	A warm blanket of a film that makes you feel like you're spending time with an old friend, putting a smile on your face that's hard to shake.
13035	7	a	The efforts of Waist Deep to make some meaningful social commentary about street gangs and the vicious circle in which African-American men often find themselves seem like an afterthought, rather than anything remotely sincere.
13036	4	a	There's lots of shooting, grenades exploding and things going bang and, even if the film gets bogged down by some needless religious mumbo-jumbo, the whole thing looks great in a grimy, Blade Runner kind of way.
13037	1	a	Destined to pick up a cult following.
13038	3	a	While it has its share of gunplay and property damage... The Infiltrator earns its chills not by pummeling the audience with violence but by gently reminding viewers that some businesses only offer permanent severance packages.
13039	1	a	Tamara Jenkins' sophomore outing is sharp, clear-eyed, uncondescending; a non-stop, non-guilty pleasure.
13040	2	a	Is this a good movie? No. Is it silly? Yes. Exaggerated? Definitely. But is it fun? Oh yeah. [Full Review in Spanish]
13041	4	a	There are some wonderful things in 'Rango': the dialogue is witty, the animation is dizzying and the action is stunningly choreographed.
13042	9	a	An outsized and endlessly pretentious romantic action-melodrama, in which the director has clearly lost any sense of moderation or self-discipline.
13043	1	a	Not only are the special effects and narrative flow much improved, and Daniel Radcliffe more emotionally assertive this time around as Harry, but the film conjures the magic of author J.K. Rowling's books.
13044	5	a	Will Smith, Fourth of July, superhero. It all seems to add up to a great combination. But they only made half a film.
13045	9	a	...too bouncy to be an Elektra bummer, but should make Marvel mascot Stan Lee think twice about burning another lucrative bridge with unintentional hilarity.
13046	9	a	A belligerent midget jewel thief assaults groins and molests women in this infantile comedy from the Wayans brothers.
13047	6	a	The film isn't good enough for the full price.
13048	3	a	I laughed. I watched it a second time - and I laughed even harder.
13049	6	a	The Prestige winds up a mediocre muddle.
13050	9	a	The movie is an assembly of cliches and obligatory scenes from dozens of other movies, all its better.
13051	6	a	Yet another uninspiring slasher movie.
13052	6	a	"Perhaps Clint ""One Take"" Eastwood wasn't the right guy to direct a movie ""acted"" by non actors, and some pretty lousy child actors as well. "
13053	4	a	Treads a fine line between wry satire, black comedy, and vaguely unsettling melodrama.
13054	4	a	The frustration here is that none of this leads anywhere. Perhaps that is the point, that some mysteries are never solved, but Jindabyne could give us a little more to work with.
13055	6	a	It's like a dud hand grenade in that at first glance it looks like it could blast but soon it's clear there's no pop.
13056	4	a	The Angry Birds Movie is quite good fun.
13057	8	a	I wouldn't want to spend five minutes with these people in a cab. Not an hour together for dinner. And sure as hell not two hours together in a movie theater.
13058	1	a	Writer-director Kelly Fremon Craig pitches the movie in a state of heightened panic, capturing the pain and frustration that engulfs Nadine after a revelation that only serves to enhance her already dominant sense that she's alone in the world.
13059	5	a	The film is very big on sunsets and sunrises. It also has a touristy appreciation for all manner of things folkloric. What it doesn't have is dramatic coherence or backbone.
13060	6	a	A taut, fast-action thriller, but Matt Damon just doesn't cut it as a spy.
13061	9	a	"Every guy has watched an action film and wondered when we'd get to the good stuff, but from minute one we're given ""the good stuff,"" but it's just not executed well enough, and the film is too kitschy to really be enjoyed."
13062	4	a	... meanders along from scene to scene in an amiable stroll ... 
13063	1	a	Recalls the talky, intellectual, but swoony summer romances of Eric Rohmer. 
13064	6	a	Choose to forego a definite plot for what feels like a bunch of sketches thrown together. 
13065	3	a	Winnie the Pooh's human friend is facing grown-up problems in a live-action story that pulls itself out of its heffalump trap to deliver a charming adventure.
13066	4	a	The director too often errs on the side of embellishing details that didn't need to be expanded upon.
13067	3	a	A charming period romance which casts Jane Austen as a budding young authoress stifled by the pride and prejudice of her time.
13068	0	a	My, The Artist is delightful, ingenious, funny, poignant and, in its own small way, profound. Put Oscar on high alert.
13069	4	a	I'd say it's worth a rent.
13070	4	a	a fine idea stretched too far and then crushed beneath a third act that feels wantonly out of place
13071	5	a	Is true love with a prostitute the best Valentine's Day fantasy Hollywood has to offer?
13072	9	a	I had high hopes for Crimson Peak, a luscious thriller created by Guillermo del Toro, but what a prancing big mess it turned out to be.
13073	3	a	...a calculated attack on conventional sentimentality and Hollywood illusion; the kind of movie that means to frustrate your expectations rather than affirm your assumptions.
13074	0	a	No Man's Land hurts when you laugh.
13075	2	a	Supply acted and engrossing.
13076	9	a	It doesn't take a cynic to wonder if editing trickery has been deployed to clarify or simply fabricate these events.
13077	2	a	A slow-paced film, it certainly has its rewards for the patient viewer, but it is not the kind of film to knock your socks off with its sparkling comedy.
13078	4	a	stands head-and-shoulders above inept Oscar bait the likes of The Lovely Bones and Nine
13079	2	a	A hilarious spoof of Trek and Trek fandom. While Galaxy Quest could have easily taken potshots at geeks, rather the film acts as more of a celebration of these sometimes misguided devotees.
13080	5	a	With a thinnier, sillier story than ever before, the threequel is left with its twin pillars of appeal: musical performances by the core cast, and shtick, also by the core cast.
13081	6	a	"How much you enjoy ""I Origins"" may well depend on whether you think lines like ""Maybe the eye really is a window to the soul"" are cliched."
13082	4	a	A surprisingly likable execution of a very thin premise
13083	8	a	Sci-fi fans expecting awesome effects and an interesting vision of the future are bound to be disappointed.
13084	3	a	Flightplan is a crackler of a suspense film and a solid entry into the early autumn season.
13085	4	a	The film is a joy to spend time in, rather than with - its pleasures are largely Pinterest-like - although McGregor throws himself gamely into the title role...
13086	3	a	Norwegian director Morten Tyldum occasionally settles on conventional biopic devices, but doesn't allow the narrative to lose any momentum.
13087	5	a	"The Predator"" is such an ungodly mess of clashing tones and chaotic action scenes."
13088	5	a	There are movies that work for children and there are movies that work for all ages, and while I, as a grownup, prefer the latter, I'll have to admit that the kids in my screening of Hotel for Dogs liked it just fine.
13089	5	a	Two Oscar-winners are no match for irresistible dogs in this so-so slapstick comedy.
13090	5	a	While this is strictly for kids, it's bright, bold and soon, er, flies by.
13091	7	a	The lead actors are good, and the film moves along so well that audiences may overlook plot holes that are, well, waist deep.
13092	0	a	Shows how a small act of kindness, like a pebble thrown into a pond, can send out many ripples, and transform another's life.
13093	8	a	Clifford is not bad on the acting, directing or even writing levels. It fails on a deeper level still, the level of the underlying conception. Something about the material itself is profoundly not funny. Irredeemably not funny.
13094	5	a	The Bill Murray magic just cannot save this beautifully shot mess.
13095	6	a	As the bloodsuckers attack our 'heroes' again and again, you feel like you're watching a video game -- from dusk to dawn.
13096	5	a	The humor is dry, dusty and packed with animated caricatures of legendary movie characters. 
13097	3	a	An inspired Disney fairy-tale mash-up.
13098	6	a	Chamber of Secrets will find millions of eager fans. But if the essence of magic is its make-believe promise of life that soars above the material realm, this is the opposite of a truly magical movie.
13099	4	a	What happens when someone leads you into temptation?
13100	4	a	It never excited me, largely, though not entirely, because it somehow felt wrong to cheer on Pazienza's decision to defy medical advice and risk paralysis.
13101	4	a	Reign of Fire may be little more than another platter of reheated Aliens, but it's still pretty tasty.
13102	0	a	Among those who do not already have rigid views on the subject, this film is likely to inspire more serious thought on the nature of Jesus than any other ever made.
13103	1	a	Utterly absorbing true-life spy thriller. Cumberbatch is wonderful. 
13104	3	a	Land of the Dead not only leaves you wishing Romero and his zombies might come back to feast once more, but that they'd take their time.
13105	6	a	The actual movie fails to do justice to its premise. 
13106	6	a	It's undeniably captivating but [it] also unfurls the dangers of filmmaking religiously devoted to forward momentum, accelerating too fast to carry the weight of its moral and socioeconomic implications, it loses gravity trying to stay light on its feet.
13107	4	a	Hancock is a hodgepodge of intriguing ideas that, if developed further or presented as more than throw-ins to a confused production, might have made for a unique superhero film.
13108	8	a	Slinks its way in and out of theaters without leaving any trace of its passage besides a distinct tang in the air of flop sweat and sorrow.
13109	4	a	"The Breakfast Club"" in the Ghetto"
13110	7	a	It's downright terrible at times. However, it's not nearly as awful as his two features that came out last year.
13111	4	a	[It] is fascinating for the myriad ways it veers right and wrong, and it speaks to the stronger passages that their weaker brethren can be overlooked within reason.
13112	3	a	An incredible experience.
13113	5	a	The overly hypothetical, weakly ambiguous I Origins gets tangled in scientific gobbledygook from which it never escapes, with no actual implications about identity.
13114	3	a	It is Padilha's sensitivity, thoroughness, persistence and artful assembly of all the angles on this story that gets us heart-wrenchingly close to understanding the 'why.'
13115	3	a	Although the story may sound as dismal as Buffalo's weather, it's surprisingly funny. Not gag funny, but observation funny -- the absurdities of real life, seen and presented.
13116	3	a	This is a movie about con games at every level.
13117	9	a	If hell, as the movie says, is the worst memory of your life on an infinite loop, I'd better clean up my act or I'll be watching The Lazarus Effect for all eternity.
13118	3	a	"Memoirs of a Geisha"" is a Hollywood-ized version of the far-better novel. Still, it's an enjoyable, lush interpretation of the best-selling tale of deceit, romance and ambition."
13119	1	a	It's strange that a film about a stupor-inducing drug should be the most--and maybe the only--exciting cultural export from Britain since the Sex Pistols.
13120	6	a	It has zero taste, zero intelligence, zero sophistication and zero redeeming social value. So it's a zero-star movie but as far as gutter-entertainment and gross-out humour goes, it's five-star laughs.
13121	0	a	"Like all great films, ""American Psycho"" is one you can discover something new in regardless of how many times you've seen it."
13122	3	a	An amazing sociological artifact, if not a great film.
13123	3	a	Mary Queen of Scots is no staid, stuffy period drama, as restrained as the breathing of corseted women. Instead, this a vital film, whose lace-trimmed bosom heaves with life.
13124	1	a	One of the best purely British films of the year.
13125	3	a	Janet Patterson has come up with an exquisite wardrobe for Fanny that magically suits both the biographical back-story and Cornish's fine physique. Let's hope Oscar agrees.
13126	6	a	Agreeable if not exactly good.
13127	6	a	Nothing really changes by the end, because after all there are five more of these waiting to be made if this one somehow manages to strike box office gold. I wouldn't hold my breath.
13128	6	a	Winslet and Davis may be great together, but the movie spends so much time on so many other characters that this one outstanding element of the film is forced to take a backseat to a series of asides.
13129	2	a	A marked improvement over its immediate predecessor, this film works as a fast and efficient thriller that offers a few great surprises along the way.
13130	3	a	Will surely allow you to see John Krasinski in a different light, both as a filmmaker and as a dramatic actor.
13131	3	a	Hitchcock happily displays its skeleton, but is lacking in the way of flesh. Not unlike Norman Bates's mother.
13132	5	a	Film about robot who wants to be human is so-so.
13133	7	a	Updating classics to meld with the sensibilities of the current era is only forgivable when the modernization truly honors the source and adds to the enjoyment. Pooh's Heffalump Movie does neither.
13134	5	a	Director Michael Lehmann cannot decide whether he is making a lewd and manic farce or a lovey-dovey romance.
13135	4	a	Revolutionary Road ranks right up there with Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf? in its characterization of a coupling deeply scabrous and defective.
13136	6	a	I wish [Lane and Cusack] had a better script to work with in this cyber-dating comedy ...
13137	6	a	This story is so lamely conceived and presented that it's a grind.
13138	3	a	John Carter is for fans of pure, joyous, escapist, adventure cinema. Seeing John Carter unfamiliar with the text; it's very clear that the original text has influenced a hell of a lot of Sci-fi flicks that we've seen before. 
13139	1	a	There's a deep sorrow here about the way families frequently fail to communicate, even when death is staring them in the face.
13140	4	a	It's the kind of movie that succeeds as a culmination of moments that ring true and sweet.
13141	3	a	Team America puts Michael Moore and company to shame by being fair and balanced in its comic assault on the left and right.
13142	0	a	Supported by excellent production design and cutting-edge tech wizardry, this ingenious film is a clever multileveled parable about the Brave New World of modern life.
13143	9	a	"Even Dick Van Patten make an appearance. Who knew ""Eight is Enough"" referred to the number of authentic hairs on Dick's head?"
13144	3	a	The World's Ends ultimately succeeds where its protagonists fail, proving it's possible to grow up without getting old.
13145	4	a	Our emotional autobiographies influence our film tastes more than we'd care to admit.
13146	6	a	So pushy and distracted it may as well have pop-up ads.
13147	3	a	John Carter is an absolute romp.
13148	2	a	To be sure, Hancock mines the superhero mythology and pays homage to the rich folklore on which it feeds and sustains itself, but what it does with the raw materials is thoroughly, refreshingly unique.
13149	0	a	A compelling piece of journalism arguing O'Grady is one of hundreds of 'sexualized' priests shielded by an absolute bureaucracy that's been corrupted absolutely.
13150	9	a	The film is witless, inspirationless and flogs its few recurring jokes till they whimper. 
13151	2	a	A fine coming-of-age ode to first love.
13152	1	a	The best look to date at the rotten US housing mortgage system that developed over the last ten years. Clear enough to make you cry.
13153	6	a	Here and There feels exactly like an amateur effort from a first-time director.
13154	10	a	Gods and Generals is a pitiful prequel to the majestic Gettysburg.
13155	4	a	It's fun and it's most welcome.
13156	9	a	What might have been fascinating after a while becomes frustrating and, finally, a real slog.
13157	9	a	Behind the guise of the Jay and Silent Bob characters and a gob of irony, this film is really quite nasty and mean spirited.
13158	4	a	One of the best things about the movie, aside from its screwily positive message, is the blithely freewheeling yet clever way that Rogen and company assemble the story's puzzle pieces.
13159	5	a	The latest Wayans brothers head-scratcher, reaches the bar their last film set. Take that as a searing insult.
13160	3	a	Gripping, heart-wrenching, powerful and a sad indictment of scientific practice, which shows that 'human' and 'humane' are all-too-often mutually exclusive.
13161	5	a	The dog is an absolute charmer -- would that the movie had spent its time on his adventures in the woods than on the dullards who ultimately seem incapable of finding a book in a library.
13162	4	a	A satisfactory enough cop movie, but not one that people will still be name checking years hence
13163	0	a	If you're into seeing different smaller movies with great acting, again, run to see this.
13164	4	a	Entertaining showbiz tale despite being short on execution.
13165	7	a	With little to distract us from its half-hearted plotting and flimsy characterizations, Larry Crowne quickly turns into an abject failure, propped up only by its fading stars' fading charisma.
13166	3	a	A black comedy that frequently goes down like the most bitter coffee imaginable.
13167	8	a	Tonally bizarre, lazily performed, and deeply unfunny.
13168	4	a	Has some honest laughs ... but it also spawned Ernest's movie career. Call it a toss-up.
13169	3	a	Nothing Like A Good Villian
13170	4	a	Thirteen Days will not satisfy young viewers looking for a thriller or older audiences eager to look behind the scenes of an unforgettable two weeks in history.
13171	1	a	Padilha sheds light on numerous social catastrophes and hypocrisies plaguing Rio de Janeiro and the incestuous, complex relationship between real life and reality television.
13172	5	a	The Predator is a lesson in exactly how to trash the memory of a risible, but loveable original.
13173	6	a	Antal's sense of humor is of the terminally unfunny sort. He trades on tired caricatures, cutesy conceits and infantile gross-outs, and the reasons for Bulcsu's paralyzing angst are left so vague and elliptical, it's difficult to care about him.
13174	3	a	Destined to be an instant classic. The performances are timeless.
13175	6	a	Writer and director Marc Lawrence keeps the film whistling along at such a giddy and relentless sitcom pace that you tend to overlook the fact that the leads have all the chemistry of a blind date.
13176	7	a	The few promising skirmishes that do erupt sputter out quickly as if fight choreographer Corey Yuen had dropped his cell connection while phoning in his moves.
13177	4	a	Astro Boy is a fun sci-fi adventure that will resonate with older fans and win younger viewers.
13178	2	a	It's fun stuff, overall, inconsequential and fluffy and not too cheesy until the end.
13179	2	a	There's a solid emotional resonance ... In many ways, this is Scott's best film yet.
13180	5	a	While the Resident Evil games may have set new standards for thrills, suspense, and gore for video games, the movie really only succeeds in the third of these.
13181	4	a	Largely thanks to Cheadle and Ejiofor in the main roles, it settles into a persuasive rhythm and airs some of the big questions about black struggle against oppression without resorting to glib, feel-good answers.
13182	5	a	It's not the worst cutesy, lo-fi love story you'll ever see, but it's shown up by all those genuine true-life tales. Alongside them, its falseness is too glaring.
13183	0	a	Ridiculously entertaining in all the best ways.
13184	6	a	Delivers the goods in formulaic fashion, but enjoys an edge thanks to a fast-paced story and, more importantly, the casting of Foxx as the romantic lead.
13185	3	a	A dark, philosophical sci-fi drama for older teens.
13186	8	a	Insulting, but that's par for the course with Perry, who can always be counted on to misinterpret his own plots. 
13187	3	a	Selma convinces that this is a tale of transcendence instead of hardship; triumph rather than defeat. And it's a story whose resonance is ever so desperately needed in the pervasive now.
13188	3	a	A one-of-a-kind experience that boasts a twice-in-a-lifetime performance from Nicolas Cage.
13189	2	a	The family that spies together, stays together. That's the homespun philosophy behind htis rousing fantasy/adventure.
13190	5	a	This Asimov-inspired adaptation is the rare summer blockbuster that supplies an actual science fiction story - albeit cleverly packaged to look like a 'Will Smith movie.'
13191	4	a	Mildly likable.
13192	3	a	Action directors take note: This is how it's done.
13193	4	a	Stays firmly, admiringly, on the surface of things -- which is where all fashion kings should reign.
13194	6	a	This is a lavishly detailed memoir in which little turns out to be that memorable.
13195	4	a	The film ultimately ends up feeling like a shaggy dog story - a metaphor for Ted Kennedy, perhaps - engaging, charismatic, but ending with a whimper.
13196	3	a	This is one hell of a funny movie, folks.
13197	7	a	As it stands, a movie like How High does nothing more than perpetuate the belief that marijuana is enjoyed solely by idiots.
13198	5	a	Without Anthony Hopkins this franchise has completely run out of gas.
13199	6	a	full review at Movies for the Masses
13200	9	a	There's nothing about Man of the Year that's quite as fantastic as its depiction of moribund Saturday Night Live as culturally and politically relevant.
13201	4	a	The referential treatment is wise - it's truly the only way a sequel like this could get away with existing.... That interrogation becomes a quicksand in which the film is repeatedly and unfortunately bogged down.
13202	5	a	Before you can say 'plot hole', the mood shifts from boredom to disbelief as a crazy-assed climax erupts from nowhere - a memorably mental end to an otherwise exasperating trip.
13203	5	a	Goran Dukic's film starts off seeming hip and funky and dark, but almost immediately runs out of steam. It feels like a short carelessly padded to feature length.
13204	5	a	I ? Huckabees really only succeeds on the level of slapstick, with Tomlin's impeccable timing being the chief delight.
13205	4	a	enjoyable and charming
13206	6	a	[An] unimpressive outing from Zhang Yimou.
13207	6	a	They speak English, but the film doesn't feel American.
13208	6	a	With the exception of Bernadine, I never felt anything for the women populating this film, as they failed to capture my interest or sympathy.
13209	4	a	...intelligent and aimed at a mature femme audience. In the end, it is all about closure.
13210	4	a	Not the film we were promised but no shame either, Miami Vice is loaded with just enough thrills and spills to keep us glued to our seats.
13211	5	a	It's not a really poor film, just a really uninteresting one.
13212	0	a	Monster is a very disturbing film, but an exhilarating movie-going experience.
13213	4	a	[VIDEO ESSAY] Of the hundred or so gags, jokes, and one-liners that comic genius Seth MacFarlane throws at the wall over the course of this bawdy and sometimes grotesque Western comedy, nearly half of them connect with a funny bone. 
13214	3	a	...the real secret to Pixar's greatness lies not in the animation, but in their wonderful choice of stories that appeal to both children and parents.
13215	2	a	redeemed by the movie's macabre silliness and folkloric atmosphere
13216	6	a	It's like an old history cyclorama 'brought to life' with a mixture of wax, starch and pulped hymnals.
13217	2	a	It's the Hustler, with Steve McQueen playing stud poker instead of Paul Newman shooting pool.
13218	2	a	It's a true joy to watch Susan Sarandon, who reprises Shelley Winters' role, deliver Alfie his due, and newcomer Sienna Miller does an excellent turn as a downward-spiraling party girl.
13219	4	a	'Sausage Party' is a filthy feast - and that's a good thing. 
13220	4	a	Its heart is in the right place, but the story and characters are all a bit too obvious and cliche.
13221	4	a	The actors act up a storm and the tacky period detail, from hideous sofas to men in curlers, fills the screen, but in the end it all feels too staged, too played, too self-aware to fully work. 
13222	3	a	The real hit of this third PP outing comes, as ever, from the cast.
13223	7	a	I laughed once.
13224	4	a	A captivating movie worth seeing.
13225	5	a	The basic truth everyone should know here is that, for all its savvy and slick promises otherwise, Hancock is an empty, ill-plotted and highly vulgar disaster that's going to disappoint virtually everyone who takes the time to see it.
13226	5	a	This is the latest in a series of films that have criminally wasted the luminous Blanchett. 
13227	7	a	A bit of political fluff several rungs below 'Dave' on the sharpness scale...a hundred minute dead spot punctuated by very occasional moments of feeble humor.
13228	4	a	Ventures into challenging, intelligent subject matter that few other films dare to.
13229	9	a	...just as sloppily caffeinated as before, with an extra layer of scummy race jokes.
13230	4	a	There's an interesting idea [here] if only the filmmakers didn't let themselves get so bogged down in the cliches of the countless boxing films of the past.
13231	3	a	Life or Something Like It probably won't become a modern-day classic in the vein of It's A Wonderful Life, but it's pretty wonderful.
13232	4	a	A visually stunning sci-fi movie that occasionally drags and could have used more imagination as well as some exploration of its provocative themes, but nonetheless manages to be a mostly thrilling adventure.
13233	5	a	Less like a slick, vicious snake and more like its flaky, disposable skin.
13234	9	a	For me it's a no.
13235	9	a	Profanity-filled, tedious addition to the sci-fi/horror franchise...Where 's Arnold Schwarzenegger when you really need him?
13236	3	a	From its jazz-inflected score to the screenplay's switchbacks of possibility and impending disaster, the movie seduces.
13237	1	a	The plot is a sideshow to Inherent Vice's luxuriant atmosphere, cracked sense of humor, and idiosyncratic characterization.
13238	1	a	Intriguing character study and exciting war drama rolled into one
13239	4	a	The film lives or dies based on the chemistry between the actors, which is just off the charts.
13240	6	a	An amiable B-level spinoff of a cult sci-fi series whose reach clearly exceeds its grasp.
13241	3	a	A small vehicle, simple and altruistic, but it rises to joyous consistency because Field grips us with her dependable blend of quirks for nearly every frame she occupies space. 
13242	1	a	Beresford nicely mixes in as much humor as pathos to take us on his sentimental journey of the heart. It really is a shame that more won't get an opportunity to embrace small, sweet 'Evelyn.'
13243	2	a	Believe it or not, The Perfect Score is a surprisingly smart, keen, and fun little high school caper film.
13244	3	a	Valentino: The Last Emperor is a documentary with privileged access to the legendary designer in his studio, workshop, backstage, his homes, even aboard his yacht and private jet.
13245	3	a	In the luxuriant Memoirs of a Geisha, three of the biggest and loveliest stars of Chinese cinema -- Ziyi Zhang, Michelle Yeoh and Gong Li -- sharpen their talons.
13246	2	a	A straightforward romantic comedy that doesn't take a lot of chances, but still manages to deliver the goods.
13247	7	a	It's neither as bad as it could have been, nor as interesting as it should have been, and the final desultory reaction is a decidedly minor one.
13248	3	a	[Fincher's] stunning visual style carries the film well past its faults.
13249	1	a	Revealed in unforgettable fashion by a capable director, the events that unfold in this film are not easily forgotten.
13250	0	a	This is a fresh narrative in an era where films aimed at young audiences are dominated by sequels, prequels, remakes, comic book and TV adaptations, and it is all the better for it.
13251	4	a	"Midnight in Paris"" holds a springtime sense of romantic desire. So much the better if you happen to walk out of the cinema, as I did, onto a rainy urban street after seeing it. "
13252	10	a	The only thing terrifying about this clunker is the thought of having to sit through it.
13253	5	a	A cliche-ridden exercise that never exhibits any real heart and focuses on characters who never come alive, it also never comes close to living up to the promise of the names in the credits.
13254	3	a	What a gripping and absorbing piece of work.
13255	4	a	The Old West apparently offered too many outhouses and too much horse manure for MacFarlane to resist over-mining that particular vein.
13256	6	a	We Bought a Zoo certainly wins this year's prize for most mediocre, heartwarming family film to win over audiences this holiday season. 
13257	1	a	It feels weird to say, 'I liked it,' but I know deep down, in places that feel uncomfortable, I loved it.
13258	4	a	What the film lacks in plot and detailed story development it makes up for in glib dialogue and the characters' self-reflection.
13259	4	a	There is indeed a lot of people-eating, with entrails spilling loosely, in Land of the Dead, but for those paying close attention, there is a good deal more going on.
13260	6	a	It's slickly executed, handsomely acted for the most part and utterly easy to forget.
13261	2	a	Veronica Mars did something new, but bringing back something old. And even Veronica, with her cool, cynical detachment, would think is pretty cool. 
13262	3	a	A heart-winning musical comedy that skips lightly and sprightly from the lily pads of hope to the manhole covers of actuality, if you see what I mean. I'm not sure I do.
13263	3	a	To Read review visit www.EmanuelLevy.com
13264	4	a	Six New Jersey teenagers conspire to steal the answers to the SAT in this thin, pleasant teenage heist comedy.
13265	3	a	'An admittedly raunchy but smart satirical poke at sexual politics in the information age. It's also funnier than we have any right to expect.'
13266	4	a	How do keep a film about insane repetition from feeling insanely repetitious?
13267	8	a	If this were Green Eggs and Ham, the film would stop at approximately the point at which you would not eat them with a fox.
13268	2	a	Your quintessential guy film. If you have any significant level of testosterone in your blood stream, you'll find something to enjoy about it.
13269	0	a	Mystic River is a rare movie that improves on its source material. It was a very good book, but the movie is great.
13270	3	a	Fans of Quentin Tarantino's Pulp Fiction and Jackie Brown are in for a treat.
13271	6	a	Anyone familiar with the better work of Damon or director Doug Liman will see their jacked-up expectations shot down.
13272	5	a	When the movie is done it really doesn't matter whether we agree that we like the Earl or not. We can all agree on liking that the movie is over.
13273	6	a	Be careful what you wish for, and also what you buy into.
13274	7	a	Performances in Eastwood films are usually uneven, but here his hands-off directing style shows no mercy ...
13275	9	a	It's a misguided enterprise all round, and while it's perfectly possible to applaud everything the film wants to say, you find yourself cringing at the ways it's saying it.
13276	4	a	It's a sunny-side-up account of the famous hippy festival in upstate New York, timed to coincide with its fortieth anniversary this year, that unashamedly plays up its comedy and youthful idealism.
13277	4	a	A serviceable bit of relationship fluff buoyed by a couple of well-tuned performances from Aniston and Vaughn.
13278	3	a	Topol breathes new life into Joseph Stein, Jerry Bock, and Sheldoon Harnick's musical.
13279	0	a	It's bound to be the funniest movie of the year.
13280	4	a	Like the fumbling around of first-time sex, The To Do List has its enjoyable moments but doesn't exactly feel like a peak experience.
13281	4	a	If you can resist Bette Davis in fat suit, hideous dress, and monobrow, you're not as gay as you think you are. I guess I kind of liked it.
13282	1	a	A hauntingly beautiful tale that will stay with you.
13283	1	a	"Menashe"" is a movie that by all rights should not exist. Sitting in the theater, watching this film for the first time, I was preoccupied throughout with the question of how the hell this movie came into being."
13284	2	a	A heist flick that counts on its coolness -- and a remarkably downbeat ending -- for its success.
13285	5	a	Schrader's Dominion: Prequel to the Exorcist may be slightly more literate than Harlin's dopey schlockfest, but this deadly dull and pretentious film is ultimately just as bad.
13286	1	a	You can go home again. But it's going to involve a lot of drinking.
13287	6	a	Mildly engaging, Dark Habits, Almodovar's third features about nuns on the run, is not as satirical or entertaining as his previous or later films.
13288	6	a	The film's principal difficulty is E. Max Frye's original screenplay, which is better thought out in terms of its narrative than of the characters.
13289	0	a	A black comedy as dry and deadpan as a bleached skull. To this end, the movie opens with a sort of death's-head grin: an in-your-face closeup of the grille of a stretch limousine...
13290	6	a	Justine's smartness reeks of self-loathing and moral vacancy. Is feminism this comatose in Texas?
13291	2	a	"Crimson Peak"" is, in a way, like the culmination of everything Del Toro has done before, embracing his blockbuster tendencies with the frightful horrors he loved growing up. "
13292	5	a	"When all is said and done, ""Angry Birds"" probably should have just been left in your pocket."
13293	8	a	Doom plays like a third-generation knock-off.
13294	3	a	Turns the romantic comedy on its head by utilizing a simple and effective formula that blends parody and affecting relationship dramatics.
13295	4	a	The appeal lies in the genre's mixed marriage of liberal sensibilities to conservative values, a happy American union that simultaneously acknowledges the fact of social injustice while insisting on the need for individual responsibility.
13296	5	a	The Light Between Oceans is a tearjerker that plays like an extra long Lifetime TV movie with a Grade A cast.
13297	5	a	This fast-paced, hyper-functional kind of storytelling doesn't allow for the depth of feeling it needs in order to work.
13298	5	a	It's all a giant cacophony of artifice masquerading as something important and meaningful.
13299	6	a	Merely a fairly silly and ultra-gory schlocker/shocker.
13300	7	a	... it's a failure of a functioning film with nonsense driving it forward and no strong characters or action to hold it together. 
13301	3	a	The cast is great in this vibrant, energetic movie with a philosophical fight at its core
13302	3	a	Assassination is contemplative and quiet, a studied film that is surprisingly engrossing, not to mention so handsomely made you can hardly take your eyes off it.
13303	1	a	Before we see anything, our ears are chilled by composer John Williams' menacing two note soundtrack which then builds into that unforgettable frenzy as the unseen shark savages its first victim.
13304	0	a	I dropped outside of time and was carried along by the narrative flow; when the film was over, I had no particular desire to leave the theater, and would happily have stayed another three hours.
13305	3	a	Shrewd and tender in equal measure, Thirteen Days is an insider drama par excellence.
13306	0	a	The second chapter of the Harry Potter series is even more magical than the first and simply the best family film of the year.
13307	5	a	Waist Deep is a hip, hard genre picture that begins well, but quickly gets in over its head.
13308	2	a	The film would have been strengthened if it had been a little more willing to challenge Tupac's behaviour.
13309	5	a	"You hope for another ""Independence Day"" but what you get is another ""Wild, Wild West""."
13310	0	a	Partly hilarious, partly horrific, totally mesmerizing.
13311	7	a	A little bit of Into the Night is funny, a lot of it is grotesque and all of it has the insidey manner of a movie made not for the rest of us but for moviemakers on the Bel Air circuit who watch each other's films in their own screening rooms.
13312	2	a	An eccentric combo of scrappy crime caper and angular redneck comedy, Logan Lucky shouldn't work anywhere near well as it does.
13313	5	a	Loud and obnoxious.
13314	0	a	Billy Elliot delivers us to the core of our secret yearnings.
13315	3	a	a subversively provocative story, done with an arch sensibility and a whole lot of savvy
13316	6	a	A ham-fisted movie that doesn't tax your brain with a lot of pesky ideas and three-dimensional characters.
13317	0	a	First Reformed is Paul Schrader's twenty-first film as a director, and probably his best. It seems to sum up a lot of things Schrader believes in, artistically and spiritually.
13318	5	a	The movie is strangely determined to move political commentary to the back row while bringing to the fore a dull, conventional thriller about electronic voting.
13319	4	a	Fans expecting more than a routine coming-of-age story had better prepare for a paper movie.
13320	1	a	Loaded with pleasant surprises, this adaptation of Matthew Quick's novel combines romantic comedy, dysfunctional family woes and a sense of danger without ever losing its way.
13321	6	a	It contains little comedy, except for free-standing one-liners, and no suspense, except for the timing of the obligatory reconciliation. It doesn't even make you think you'd like to visit its island paradise.
13322	3	a	A cool summer movie packing a nice mix of action, explosions, and brains.
13323	7	a	Final notes: this is a movie in which Dolph Lundgren is expected to convincingly portray a junkie and have an American accent. Also, Jet Li plays a character called Yin Yang. Do with this information what you will.
13324	4	a	Her warts-and-all history of the blues has as much documentary truth as a West End musical.
13325	6	a	For those jonesing for a loosely connected string of comedy sketches, heavy on the scatological humor, this is the fix.
13326	3	a	If I had seen this film before the original, I might have actually preferred it.
13327	1	a	David O. Russell has pulled off a tricky feat here, finding just the right tone in crafting a romantic comedy whose sweethearts suffer from bipolar disorder and depression.
13328	3	a	The style-over-substance Scott's only substantive text.
13329	2	a	Marsh's film is as much a study of how we behave as a species as it is of what happens to Nim. And we don't come off particularly well.
13330	6	a	Bonello still fails to crack the toughest biopic nut of them all: how to shape a human life into a compelling narrative. 
13331	3	a	Arctic Tale shows us a changing world and life changing with it.
13332	7	a	Adrenaline-propelled and outrageously offensive, it's a cinematic video game that's neither coherent nor credible.
13333	6	a	A mopey, dull, American Beautyish suburbia-is-hell story.
13334	0	a	Not only does 'The Incredibles' advance the art of animation, it takes the genre out of the ballpark.
13335	4	a	There's some good material in their story about a retail clerk wanting more out of life, but the movie too often spins its wheels with familiar situations and repetitive scenes.
13336	5	a	...it's a story full of cliches, narrative gaps and poorly developed characters. [Full Review in Spanish] 
13337	1	a	The World's End, in its frequent oscillations of tone, rides toward a logical end-point that makes for the simultaneous fulfillment and subversion of expectations.
13338	5	a	You may be galled that you've wasted nearly two hours of your own precious life with this silly little puddle of a movie.
13339	4	a	A routine Will Smith cop-on- the-hunt thriller at heart, I, Robot lacks imaginative excitement.
13340	3	a	Antal has a bright future.
13341	4	a	"Carnage Park"" is a solid, unsparing thriller, but its potential for greatness slips just out of grasp during its climactic stretch."
13342	9	a	It's too bad Martin already made What's the Worst That Could Happen? The title really fits this one.
13343	1	a	While not the laughfest that was Vicky Christina Barcelona, Midnight reveals a different side of Woody Allen, one that's kinda magical.
13344	4	a	Jeong sensitively gives her film an underlying sadness as the young women cope with the changes in their lives
13345	2	a	Solid summer entertainment.
13346	1	a	a powerful political thriller that is all the more unnerving because it is based in truth
13347	3	a	This is the kind of American independent comedy-drama that restores our faith in the cinema, combining a talented cast, witty direction and a razor-sharp script to reboot the coming-of-age genre.
13348	1	a	"Like its blessedly quirky, heart-on-her-sleeve, one-of-a-kind title character, ""Hello, My Name Is Doris"" is beautiful and irreplaceable just as it is."
13349	0	a	It's that perfect movie that you watch in order to feel that you may not be alone in the world after all. It works like a dream.
13350	4	a	These are ideas from old movies, and presented without any of the conviction those pictures used to give them.
13351	0	a	Call Me By Your Name is a staggeringly beautiful film that brings together a fully fleshed out artistic vision ... as well as a host of brilliant performances from its cast.
13352	9	a	Mawkish, obvious, and plain ol' not funny.
13353	3	a	The film is anchored by yet another hypnotically complex Cumberbatch performance. He's turning greatness into a habit.
13354	4	a	A comic exploration of the changing face of the mafia, the only damage this mob will do is to your funnybone.
13355	5	a	A title card says the film was 'inspired by the life of Jackie Kallen.' Nothing's actually inspired here, from Dutton's haphazard direction to an inapt score by the late Michael Kamen.
13356	1	a	Returning to more intimate filmmaking after helming Batman Begins, director Christopher Nolan manages to make The Prestige's complex story as easily understandable and effective as he made the outwardly straightforward comic book adaptation
13357	2	a	... maintains a sedate, almost starchy, facade, but you never lose sight of the violence and horror as lurking just below the proper surface of Victorian society
13358	0	a	A heart-rending and redemptive Holocaust story, this Oscar-grabbing epic added to Spielberg's directorial credibility, showing he could handle controversial, sophisticated stories with real sensitivity.
13359	5	a	The title is perfectly apt -- and too easy a target -- for this romantic comedy that never shifts out of second gear.
13360	1	a	Granik brings to her drama a clear-eyed realism as she charts one woman's descent into a drug-fueled purgatory.
13361	2	a	Chockful of suspense.
13362	3	a	It's the kind of film where [Jack Black] can get carried away and have fun with his usual expressions and gestures, although it's Blanchett who takes the applause. [Full review in Spanish]
13363	0	a	Worthy follow up
13364	2	a	"It's fast-paced amusing fluff if you wanna, ""Stay loose, stay liquid and laugh a lot."
13365	3	a	Unusually intimate outing for director Ridley Scott glides along a slick, shiny, Hollywood-style surface. But the actors keep it real throughout.
13366	9	a	Cronenberg seems like he has something specific, possibly devilishly satiric in mind, but his screen instincts are numb, constructing a feature that lurches from scene to scene.
13367	6	a	Timberlake walks off with the movie. Too bad it's not worth stealing.
13368	5	a	We can understand the need to have a support group for elderly action heroes who want to relive the glory years. But did they have to release it as a film? Unnecessary.
13369	3	a	Loses steam in its last half-hour, but it has obvious virtues -- and it feels heartfelt, a generous elder's film about a generous elder's bequest to the world.
13370	3	a	Yes, it's very, very silly, but The Skin I Live In is also hell of a lot of fun.
13371	7	a	Eli Roth made a family film. That's weird. Although there is certainly something juvenile about the filmmaker's work in general.
13372	0	a	This sci-fi entry is grim, but compelling and features breathtaking visuals. The director's cut is far superior simply because it lacks the annoying voiceover and trusts its audience with the story.
13373	5	a	A tired retread of better jokes in the first two movies, this drags along to an admittedly heartwarming conclusion.
13374	0	a	A realistic, heartbreaking look at a savage disease so eloquently exhibited by Moore given the proper respect by its filmmakers.
13375	4	a	While it's a bit awkward and self-indulgent, it also creates two extremely vivid characters and one of cinema's more believable romances.
13376	9	a	What [Ryan] appears to be doing is an impression of Johnny Depp doing an impression of Keith Richards doing an impression of Liz Taylor.
13377	4	a	Offers a wacky portrait of the sexual foibles of men.
13378	10	a	Has no redeeming qualities whatsoever, and makes extra effort to insult its audience whenever possible.
13379	3	a	Pooh's Heffalump Movie, with its message of tolerance and open-mindedness, is a fine afternoon at the megaplex. And it will make a welcome addition your home library when it's released on video.
13380	5	a	...has style to spare, a few laughs and some imaginative touches. Also like 'Avengers' it has stars who look like they'd rather be somewhere else, a lack of verve and a script that takes the long road to nowhere.
13381	5	a	Most of the movie, which was sort of directed by special-effects veteran Jim Isaac, is inept restagings of Aliens scenes, and climaxes with some TermiJason idiocy.
13382	4	a	"Diane Lane, back in her ""middle-aged journey of discovery"" comfort zone, is by far the most scrumptious, delightful part of this Euro-trip. "
13383	3	a	Pedro Almodovar's latest movie is positively drunk in its desire for handsome actors and beautiful actresses, gorgeously art-directed sets, suspense, comedy, ironic flashbacks, tragic romance.
13384	6	a	It's just another loud, hyperactive Home Alone rip-off, and how many of those does the world really need?
13385	4	a	It may be time for Van Sant to remove his head from -- well, let's call it the underground -- and re-find his inner Forrester.
13386	1	a	... Logan Lucky speeds and cruises like the freshest Ford Mustang. It shifts and drifts without any sign of choking. 
13387	1	a	A fully subjective probe into the consciousness of a young man and a generous display of artistic empathy.
13388	3	a	Burton and his collaborators present a movie musical that's like nothing you've ever seen.
13389	5	a	Max Payne is content to be an efficient vehicle for the delivery of a familiar range of sensations, some of which almost rise to the level of feelings.
13390	4	a	Tom Hanks perfectly embodies white bread goodness as mission leader Jim Lovell and, while we may all know the ending, it's a tribute to Howard's no-frills, focused direction that the story remains undeniably gripping.
13391	6	a	A pretty package that's empty on the inside.
13392	9	a	"How Do You Know"" that this movie is not all that great. Wait till about half way through and then ask for a refund."
13393	3	a	Driven by a talented cast blessed with quick-witted characters.
13394	4	a	It does pull back the curtain on a traditionally withdrawn public figure. For that alone, the documentary is a fascinating glimpse into a mind that's always on the go.
13395	6	a	...Wonderland revels in sleaze and unpleasantness...
13396	3	a	Truffaut's ode to his childhood is an engrossing watch that is alluring in its simplicity and brilliant in its direction. It flows nicely at its own pace, never allowing melodrama to ruin its realistic and voyeuristic atmosphere. 
13397	3	a	The pacing of A Most Wanted Man, a movie without any real dramatic crescendos, can get tedious without complete attention that the movie earns.
13398	6	a	Crimson Peak is a movie that's all windup and no pitch. It requires a patience of you that I'm not sure it necessarily earns, and a level of patience it doesn't feel obliged to reward. 
13399	6	a	Wasabi does its job colorfully and entertainingly, as long as you don't lean too hard on such niggling details as logic, legality and the laws of physics.
13400	6	a	I felt like there was this awesome party going on that I just didn't have an invitation to. It seems that if you'd read the books, this would have been awesome.
13401	3	a	High school, small town, teenagers in hormone hell -- or is that heaven?
13402	5	a	This isn't meant to be a knock on the outstanding actors, but it's kind of disappointing when the best aspect of a fantasy mystery is the work from Jack Black and Cate Blanchett
13403	2	a	Fine performances from chemistry rich leads Annette Bening and Jamie Bell provide the right amount of heart and sorrow. 
13404	3	a	vibrant editing, an intelligible screenplay, and a magnetic performance by Julia Roberts keep Eat, Pray from dipping too far into self-indulgence. 
13405	6	a	It seems less a remake than an alternate version.
13406	3	a	Consistently funny, frequently hilarious. Just don't order one of those jumbo hotdogs before you take your seat - never mind the guilt, you'll choke laughing.
13407	2	a	You won't realize how far under your skin it's gotten until you catch yourself singing the theme song on your way out of the theater.
13408	0	a	...we are taken full speed into a world of despair and self-destructiveness that is more fun than any action film, more thoughtful than any hokey Hollywood drama, and more clever than a typical Hollywood romantic comedy.
13409	3	a	Your head may want to resist Evelyn, but your heart will have a hard time of it.
13410	4	a	The movie's two instincts are at complete odds with each other.
13411	0	a	Ghostbusters thrives on the fine line between taking it all seriously enough to be scary, then poking fun at it in the most creative ways possible.
13412	2	a	An entertainingly thrilling and inspirational action/drama that although a step down in terms of quality, still contains the heart and emotional punch that made the first two Rocky films so great.
13413	5	a	Hartnett does windbag cockiness well, yet the overriding conception of his character and the Dot Com phenom in general is so straightforward and unrevealing that his effort goes for naught.
13414	0	a	Rarely does a prison film delight and amuse.
13415	3	a	Anyone actually looking for a genuinely scary movie at this point will have a lot of fun with Joy Ride.
13416	8	a	Film critics wake up every morning praying their day will include a movie like this.
13417	6	a	Though entirely sympathetic toward Grahame, it fails to animate whatever was unique about her.
13418	4	a	Easily the most controversial film of the year, Gibson's fil is a visually bold, relentlessly violent epos that suffers from a shallow, undernourished narrative and no characterizations to speak of.
13419	3	a	A wonderful comic Western with Stewart and Dietrich at top form. Always a pleasure to watch.
13420	3	a	A movie that's smart and entertaining almost every step of the way.
13421	8	a	Politicians of the world are the celebrity faces of multi-national global corporations that call the shots. If that's news to you then sure, go see this documentary about Italy's variety of such exploitation.
13422	4	a	In many ways a throwback to the era of Doris Day and Jack Lemmon movies.
13423	5	a	Ryan, fitted out with...Brokovich-provocative wardrobe gives an interesting performance, but one that constantly demands analysis
13424	5	a	I, Frankenstein doesn't have much of a brain and is completely missing a funny bone.
13425	6	a	Amenabar's take on the Hollywood epic is admittedly flawed, but it centers on an interesting, rare protagonist, a female scientist who's not defined by gender or sexuality. 
13426	3	a	It's subdued, at times even too leisurely, but the film and its characters are luminous, especially lead Ayase Haruka.
13427	1	a	The charm of this film is in its low-key approach. The plot isn't milked for humor or pathos: Both emerge naturally from familiar situations.
13428	3	a	Great heroes are often enhanced by the villains they face, and such is the situation here. To really work, Bond needs great bad guys. Silva is bad at its best.
13429	3	a	A dramatically powerful statement.
13430	10	a	River Phoenix gives a somnambulant impersonation of Christian Slater impersonating Jack Nicholson, and Samantha Mathis spends much of the movie trying to figure out exactly who her character is.
13431	3	a	It's all hip, humorous, sad, edgy and immensely entertaining, this sprawling period parable about a group of greedy people who aren't who they purport themselves to be.
13432	5	a	Second-generation Hollywood wrestles with but never truly pins down this big-hearted, broad and often flat comedy...
13433	4	a	The movie itself is a lot of fun. And if you can separate yourself from the visual distraction, you'll find plenty to enjoy.
13434	10	a	Isn't scary at all and isn't nearly as funny as its filmmakers seem to think it is.
13435	4	a	Eastwood is making a point here about the heroism of ordinary men, the grit behind seemingly banal bros, though it's one of the oddest and lowest-key films he's ever made.
13436	6	a	The film has about five too many poop jokes.
13437	6	a	Josh Brolin does the pizza-faced bounty hunter justice, but pretty much everyone else involved -- including Megan Fox -- lets him down.
13438	4	a	I must admit Robert Pattinson does dead extremely well.
13439	9	a	...a pervasively meaningless endeavor that's simply unable to justify its existence...
13440	1	a	Time travel and unexpected love combine for one of the best films of the year.
13441	7	a	I'm not usually a fan of awkward humour, and this film is filled with nothing but awkward humour.
13442	3	a	Mr Loaf was never better on screen than as the ill-fated, big-hearted Bob Paulson, the only warm character in a cold, cold movie.
13443	1	a	What sets this movie apart is the way it creates characters who feel like they have vivid, full lives even when they're not on-screen. So as they collide and connect, everything feels organic and full of possibilities.
13444	8	a	Plays like an unusually bad, overblown episode of Miami Vice, and has virtually none of the pleasures of the original.
13445	4	a	Despite overstaying its welcome a wee bit, remains an anthem of insurrection, melding its political and humanistic truths into an almost dreamily subversive film tinged with humor and some small hope.
13446	6	a	There's plenty of manufactured action.
13447	4	a	The movie is a bumpy ride at times, but, like Doris, it has its heart in the right place.
13448	1	a	Von Trier shows himself once again as a director with imagination, one who continues to push back the boundaries of cinema.
13449	3	a	'Jack Black is back on track.'
13450	5	a	"The makers of ""Must Love Dogs"" clearly have an affection towards canines but they didn't seem to even like the audience."
13451	3	a	The story is just a little too straightforward and predictable with Eastwood apparently too anxious to concentrate on too much detail of the final game.
13452	3	a	[A] deeply, dangerously earnest take on truth and beauty in trouble.
13453	6	a	The true paradox of this movie is that those enjoyably wild twists alone would've made this film a whole lot of fun to watch with a big multiplex audience, even as inconsistent and ultimately illogical it turns out to be.
13454	5	a	Ultimately disappointing due to an inane script which fashions a thoroughly unlikable, idiotic protagonist who invites derision more than sympathy.
13455	6	a	Thinks it is grand without ever being so.
13456	5	a	"Between the gypsy psychic and the distracting characters, ""Darling Companion"" loses its way."
13457	3	a	his endearingly hokey low-budget B-movie comes with a high nostalgia factor from the Reagan era
13458	3	a	A movie to get lost in - an old school epic of excess that recalls the stubbornly meandering cinema of Luchino Visconti.
13459	7	a	After Things To Do in Denver When You're Dead, Kiss the Girls and now Don't Say a Word, I am officially putting the name of director Gary Fleder on my list of filmmakers to avoid, if at all possible.
13460	2	a	While the film is not quite in the same league as Eastwood's finest works of the past decade, it is still to be admired for telling quite a complex tale in such a clear and compelling manner.
13461	1	a	An incredible amount of fun.
13462	4	a	Less involving than it could be.
13463	2	a	High art and smart sci-fi it is not, but you have to hand it to a film that plays its cards right, lays everything out on the table, and goes for broke.
13464	4	a	Tales of the attacks Nim inflicted on his many carers are horrific, but there is a pervasive sense there was nothing else they could have expected. 
13465	5	a	It's hard to ignore the overwhelming sense of dullness as the story plods along with an unbreakably straight face.
13466	6	a	"A creaking ""star vehicle"" for two stars who should have known better, and maybe had a little chemistry. "
13467	5	a	There are some funny bits of business along the way, but they are invariably undercut by uneven performances, gags that fall flat and a mean-spirited tone. In the end, this one leaves an extremely sour aftertaste.
13468	3	a	A star-studded heist flick that calls to mind some of the eclectic director's most popular work even if it falters a bit at the end.
13469	3	a	See website for more details.
13470	3	a	Artistically, Bond's sixth entry, the only one to star Aussie George Lazenby, is much better than given credit to, though commercially it was one of the weakest.
13471	3	a	Shadow of the Vampire might only play a few notes, but they're solid notes, expertly played.
13472	4	a	As played by Rosamund Pike, Colvin is steely, stubborn, an old-school Fourth-Estater and saltier than the Sargasso Sea.
13473	9	a	It's as woefully incompetent as its predecessor, except it's dealing with a smaller budget, you know, for added dreadfulness.
13474	8	a	Go Pay Suffer
13475	3	a	It reclaims smart sensitivity in teen movies-emotional territory that sometimes feels like it's been ceded to the occasional TV show.
13476	9	a	Whatever might have been raunchy-cute has been edited out of it. It's a movie with a lot of very good-looking people trying to find something funny to say or do.
13477	3	a	Ironically enough, it's the journey, not the destination, that makes these movies so damn fun.
13478	1	a	This is no soup-to-nuts King biopic.
13479	4	a	Not a particularly precocious debut, in the context of the Coppola dynasty, but nevertheless feels much like the work of a very young if talented person who has yet to discover a unique voice.
13480	9	a	Easily the worst film about boxing I've ever seen, and I've been trying to think of a sport-related flick equally as unappealing for the last week. I'm still drawing blanks.
13481	6	a	We get a lot of what happened to James Brown without a lot of who he was, or even really why he mattered.
13482	2	a	Goes off the deep end.
13483	3	a	...is the movie worth all the hype? Partially yes, but mostly because of the special effects.
13484	3	a	Unconventional romantic comedy with a slap and a tickle.
13485	4	a	This is a Hobbit cobbled together by an obsession with technological ingenuity at the expense of storytelling.
13486	2	a	A competent, by-the-numbers recreation of the events.
13487	1	a	Shares a trait with Henry: It's relentlessly powerful and makes up for its lack of well thought-out plotting with deftly effective execution.
13488	2	a	Slightly pretentious, but original enough to be a bit interesting, and buoyed by strong performances from Depp and Morton, The Libertine is a decent telling of a historical footnote, most interesting because of its strong feminist message.
13489	5	a	Secondhand Lions manages to squander the services of seasoned vets Michael Caine and Robert Duvall, and promising newcomer Haley Joel Osment, with a tale that is dramatically false and disturbingly vicious.
13490	3	a	Neither revolutionary in its approach or subject matter nor seamless in its storytelling, Billy Elliot nevertheless manages to sketch the lives of characters we come to care about.
13491	1	a	the greatest alien invasion movie ever
13492	4	a	What makes this film special is Serry's ability to take what is essentially a contained family conflict and put it into a much larger historical context.
13493	5	a	Spade's signature trait...has always been a smugness that far outweighs any talent he might have to be smug about.
13494	4	a	Bonello makes good use of mirrors and reflective surfaces throughout the film, all very fitting for a story about a boy as beautiful and as self-absorbed as Narcissus himself.
13495	2	a	Becomes bizarrely comical as it gets increasingly depraved. But Herzog's deliberately bonkers approach, matched by Cage's hammy performance, is strangely entertaining.
13496	0	a	Warm, witty and endlessly welcoming, not only is it the filmmaker's finest Oater -- better even than the sparkling Red River -- it's arguably the quintessential Hawks flick.
13497	3	a	Painfully awkward encounters ensue, with Plaza handling it all with her deadpan elegance.
13498	5	a	Billy Lynn's Long Halftime Walk ultimately commits the greatest crime a war film can. It tells you how to feel. 
13499	6	a	It's not enough to merely swoon over Witherspoon. The movie's entirely too long and leaden to get by on that alone. 
13500	3	a	Performances are low key but accomplished, comedy and tragedy are delicately balanced and the whole thing has the feel of a sprawling but very absorbing soap.
13501	3	a	Even with all the good stuff, The Light Between Oceans too often shines dimly.
13502	4	a	There's never a dull moment in this surprisingly clever imagining of one of the most popular video games of all time, especially considering that the murderous mayhem and extreme bloodletting that are its hallmarks remain intact.
13503	4	a	Something, anything needs to be done soon to keep Wilson's stoner-savant persona from becoming as generic a product as dairy-case cookie dough.
13504	5	a	To see The Passion of the Christ is to feel brutalized.
13505	9	a	Too often does the film rely on explicit gags that feel out of place, unnecessary and mostly unfunny.
13506	1	a	Bursting with wonderfully imaginative scenes.
13507	3	a	The frequent outbursts of comedy help alleviate a tone that's appropriately muted and sad, and Jenkins should be credited for refusing to tack smiley-faces onto a tough, possibly lose-lose situation.
13508	4	a	Fun, forgettable caper comedy
13509	4	a	Turns from interesting character study to wan romantic comedy.
13510	6	a	"Ya gotta give a sliver of credit to any movie that would include the term ""Half-Digested Billy"" in its closing credits. "
13511	5	a	Just remember: In the dark, no one can see you laugh.
13512	7	a	Between us, let's just forget the movie.
13513	7	a	This is a movie of fake conflict, fake heart, even fake doggy love.
13514	6	a	fast-paced, sloppy, and pretty dumb, but it's over quickly
13515	5	a	Like the Gosford Park of bad acting, this is one throwback that should have been thrown back.
13516	5	a	The story also seems fairly vague and spread across several different narrative threads that never quite add up. No one has a clear motive, including the Predator himself, and this makes for confusing, tensionless viewing.
13517	2	a	The film is predictable in the reassuring manner of a beautifully sung holiday carol.
13518	4	a	Sure, it's a movie aimed at teenagers in which an unpopular guy wants to get a popular girl, but there's a lot more to this story's map between points A and B.
13519	5	a	Prince is directing this time out, and even more so than in Under the Cherry Moon, the man proves he has no idea what to do behind the camera
13520	4	a	At its best, the film offers a pointed critique of a youth culture that views someone like Jesse James Hollywood as a person to emulate.
13521	1	a	The Bourne Supremacy is an exceptional thriller that is a sequel to a good one... Power runs through every frame, making the smallness of the world itself seem scary.
13522	6	a	Some hearty laughs, but there's also a lot of effluence-based humor to wade through.
13523	3	a	While not one of the best musicals made by MGM or Arthur Freed, it's light, whimsical, entertaining, and the only opportunity to see Fred Astaire and Judy Garland together.
13524	5	a	Game fans will be disappointed. Zombie fans will be disappointed. Paul Anderson's fan will be disappointed.
13525	3	a	This is an intimate, lyrical yet incendiary film, and it will please fans of both Young and Jarmusch.
13526	2	a	To DuVernay's credit, she manages to make almost every moment as riveting as the last, and a big part of that success falls on the casting, even those in bit roles.
13527	1	a	The intelligently observed and staggeringly beautiful Italian foreign-language Oscar nominee is about life, death and the search for the things that give meaning to both.
13528	3	a	An engaging CGI-fueled ride.
13529	7	a	...[McCarthy] goes for it Bugs-Bunny-meets-the-Roadrunner-meets-all-three-Stooges-style. It's just that the movie she's single-handedly trying to save isn't worth her effort.
13530	1	a	The last scenes reshuffle the deck with a tipped cap to tradition and a clear eye on the future. They suggest Bond has learned all he must to persevere. Perhaps he can go forth defined less by those he's lost and have a little fun in doing so.
13531	3	a	Good, old-fashioned Connery heist flick. Goes down smooth.
13532	10	a	The worst movie of the year.
13533	3	a	I, Robot succeeds where other movies that blend science fiction and mystery fiction have failed.
13534	6	a	There?s too much eating, too much praying and too much loving. I should have known given the title.
13535	1	a	The Edge of Seventeen is a coming-of-age story that feels fresh and timeless because it encapsulates an experience -- with its unattainable crushes and cool shoes and awkward silences -- that is timeless.
13536	4	a	It's surprising The Rock's latest is as bearable as it is.
13537	1	a	If you're looking to have your nerves fried and your pulse pounded, this is your ticket to ride.
13538	3	a	An all-out assault on academic hooey, Russell takes I Love Huckabee's and makes a true, theoretical screwball comedy.
13539	6	a	Henson, in a role that could easily have degenerated into an angry-black-woman caricature, is better than the material deserves.
13540	7	a	full review at Movies for the Masses
13541	6	a	If anyone could have saved the stagnant cinematic genre, it would be Brooks. Sadly, How Do You Know is as creatively confused as its title. 
13542	9	a	It's a steep task to consider Alfie anything other than a Vanity Fair pictorial.
13543	7	a	[Peter] Morgan's script isn't up to his usual standards and [Clint] Eastwood's also off his game.
13544	6	a	The feature is better executed in a shoot-first-ask-questions-later style that encourages silence and brutality. Once the material is asked to explain itself, the entertainment value of the film curdles immediately.
13545	5	a	Good Luck Chuck is the anti-Superbad.
13546	6	a	Goes nowhere fast.
13547	4	a	Pleasant diversion with lots of silly fun for teens.
13548	2	a	With apologies to William Ernest Henley, one might say that under the bludgeonings of Clint, Invictus emerges a little boring, but unbowed.
13549	1	a	The Incredibles shows once and for all what was right in front of our noses all along, that Pixar is not an animation studio but a movie studio. And not just a movie studio, but the best movie studio.
13550	7	a	Eastwood fails to infuse any moments of suspense or heart into the story and when all is said and done, Hereafter is an anticlimactic, sleepy and momentum-less mess of a film.
13551	3	a	This is a movie worth seeing-a noble effort to polish the image of a superior journalist hell-bent on bringing the truth to the world.
13552	6	a	What most hurts the movie is its topper, its Big Plot Twist.
13553	2	a	Watching the film scramble towards its inevitable conclusion, one gets the sense that Heineman sees Colvin as a kindred spirit. 
13554	5	a	"Only the dog has a clue about when the ""Devil's Due."
13555	5	a	This Chinese battle epic features exciting, show-stopping fight scenes, but the storytelling in between is almost non-existent, as if lazily looking for ways to kill the time. 
13556	4	a	Fads may come and go, but dinosaurs will always be cool... a fact for which Jurassic Park should be eternally grateful.
13557	2	a	The movie's even-handed portrayal of two cultures uneasily transacting the most personal business resonates with truth.
13558	9	a	A clunky ribbing of the movie industry.
13559	5	a	The Wayanses rely on their usual tired jokes here -- spittakes, white people speaking jive, Marlon grimacing in gastrointestinal distress.
13560	9	a	As the unwanted bum guest, Owen Wilson plays a variation of the role played by Monty Woolley in Man Who Came to Dinner and Nolte in Down and Out in Beverly Hills, but unlike them, he's just a disturbing presence and has no profound effect on his guests.
13561	2	a	The House with a Clock in Its Walls is exactly what it needs to be: charming and creepy. If this is what we get when sensationalized horror directors take a stab at the lighter side of cinema, then let them have at it.
13562	2	a	The Prestige looks great and there's too much class involved for it to be anything but entertaining. Even so, a suspicion that Nolan overstretched and overdeveloped his story is inescapable.
13563	3	a	The music in the film was fantastic and I waited through the end credits to hear the signature song.
13564	3	a	A measured, leisurely paced but moving Shakespearean tragedy.
13565	4	a	What starts out as a strained, silly and strictly-for-the-chitlins collection of talking animal shenanigans redeems itself through sheer force of personality.
13566	7	a	A painfully melodramatic, over-the-top comedy-drama without subtlety, effective humor, or credibility.
13567	2	a	A solid, rather restrained rendition of John Keats' final years, Campion's period piece avoids pitfalls and cliches of the biopic genre, and while not illuminating of Keats as a unique poet, it does convey the taste of first love.
13568	5	a	A family drama that shies away from any serious examination of racism in America
13569	2	a	As the movie travels from New York to Idaho to India, nimbly slinging itself over gaps in likelihood and logic, it works its own sort of magic.
13570	3	a	In less experienced hands, this would surely have wound up as lurid, trashy pulp. Yet Fincher plays it straight and keeps it serious.
13571	0	a	The plot crackles with energy and misdirection, while the black-and-white film sharpens angles and amplifies the shadows lurking in every hallway.
13572	4	a	It's no The Killing of a Chinese Bookie, and its final section chucks freedom in favor of formula, but it has moments of genuinely kooky energy.
13573	0	a	This is what a movie adaptation should be: a film whose base narrative has its roots in the source material but whose soul can be identified through the images that unfold on screen.
13574	5	a	The problem is Eminem himself, who has clearly been drilled by the director to play to what will have to pass as strengths: stillness, cool, control.
13575	3	a	Audacious and bursting with ideas.
13576	6	a	Director Peyton Reed doesn't quite bring the sharpness, litheness and attention to detail he brought to Bring It On and Down With Love to The Break-Up, which is nonetheless alternately funny and painful.
13577	2	a	Surprisingly gripping.
13578	6	a	The time that monopolizes food and earthly pleasures resents the characters and narrative arc of the film, which never manages to offer us a solid story and a conclusive ending. [Full review in Spanish]
13579	1	a	Todd Haynes has made a love story intimate in scope and sweeping in feeling, one that shoves pessimism to the sidelines in exchange for optimism and tough, earnest sentiment.
13580	1	a	It may pull you into the tent with a promise of hoochie-koochie girls, but it delivers a rousing sermon on faith, hope and charity before it lets you back out again.
13581	3	a	First Reformed is Schrader's best film in a long time. It provides an unflinching look at many of life's big questions.
13582	2	a	As a nostalgia trip, and a valentine to the virtues of its terrific source material, Veronica Mars gets the job done.
13583	0	a	Indy's first adventure is a rip-roaring action masterpiece.
13584	5	a	Nothing about the movie resonates emotionally.
13585	9	a	[A] laugh-free comedy.
13586	7	a	There's just nothing there; JONAH HEX is soulless.
13587	2	a	There's powerful craft here, and Larsson's story has more than proven its ability to grip.
13588	3	a	The funny, adventurous Serenity proves there is life after cancellation.
13589	4	a	"Whiskey Tango Foxtrot"" is a pretty funny movie. Then, it's a not-bad drama. Then, it's a wacky comedy. Then, it's a tedious romance. Then, I'm not exactly sure what it's trying to do."
13590	4	a	Unfortunately, lead actress Anne Hathaway is not suited to the role. Her Jane doesn't seem like the main character in her own story.
13591	3	a	It will remind you what it was like to be a teenager during the last few days of summer. And even though the plot is a little thin, you probably won't even notice until long after the music stops.
13592	1	a	There's no way Joan Crawford or Barbara Stanwyck would ever have been allowed to touch this material during the golden age of women's pictures, but their loss is Blanchett and Mara's gain.
13593	4	a	Goes the distance as a parable about what is really means to have heart.
13594	3	a	Many will appreciate the genial, good-natured goofiness.
13595	3	a	There are lots of interesting ideas and some fine work on display, but it never gels into a fully satisfying movie experience. Like its titular super-anti-hero, it only works sometimes.
13596	4	a	highly entertaining romantic comedy that still has the Hitchcock touch--a dark comedy using a dead body as the central MacGuffin
13597	6	a	Best as a comedy and worst when it tries to get serious.
13598	5	a	This time, the proverbial lack of subtlety in the director's narrative is not synonymous with agility. [Full Review in Spanish] 
13599	10	a	Some movies are so scummy that after watching them you feel the need for a shower; after sitting through this one, you might think a scouring pad is in order.
13600	5	a	There's no emotional connection to the characters. This is cookie cutter anguish meant to manipulate the gullible into believing that they're watching something meaningful.
13601	0	a	Hitchcock's most tender story.
13602	6	a	An ambitious but muddled and uninvolving tale of the struggle of an American Italian family with religion, sex, and spirituality.
13603	6	a	Instead of a madcap farce, the movie grinds along into a series of laboured comic bits.
13604	4	a	Rock Dog is memorable enough, especially that not-bad song that eventually ties everything together, and it goes down easy. Just like popcorn.
13605	3	a	"Cleverly acted and beautifully rendered, ""Bee Movie"" is another animated triumph from the studio that brought us ""Shrek."
13606	6	a	Ardant might wrestle with alienation, but Bright Days Ahead never risks alienating its self-satisfied target audience.
13607	4	a	In the first two acts, the movie is rousing summer fare.
13608	7	a	As a film -- and more importantly, as a document of faith -- it is a dismayingly simplistic, obvious, overbearing waste remarkable only for the quantities of blood it spills.
13609	2	a	Comedienne Tina Fey proves that she's equally adept at revealing her vulnerability in a dramedy.
13610	2	a	Director Bruce Beresford follows a straightforward and predictable path, yet succeeds in pulling your emotional strings even when you know what's coming.
13611	4	a	It may start off edgy but it ends with a double helping of schmaltz.
13612	6	a	An unfortunate use of Pixar magic to tell a tired story in a typical world.
13613	6	a	Tthis CG-animated adaptation of the Japanese comic classic feels derivative but moderately entertaining, particularly in some of the highflying visuals.
13614	4	a	A nice enough diversion when the theaters are filled with weightier Oscar contenders.
13615	0	a	Alfie plays homage to its roots while creating its own, deeply absorbing movie experience.
13616	3	a	Pixar Studios' most technologically advanced effort.
13617	6	a	"Except for Depp's performance, ""Secret Window"" is a film we've seen and heard before."
13618	1	a	Avoiding the safety of the PC blanket, David O. Russell has crafted a canny, crafty and altogether adorable little misfit of a movie.
13619	3	a	Bright Star, a story of loss and love illustrated by poetry, seldom does more than gently move us. It is a fine film to look at and listen to but there are heights it fails to scale.
13620	4	a	Cliched, predictable and unbearable in parts - but it never once loses sight of what it's trying to achieve, affectionately, and earnestly, adhering to the tropes of the romantic comedy genre.
13621	3	a	A heady, industrial-sized vat of Wright's unique, morish humour.
13622	3	a	"There's no lying or condescending from this director. ""Nebraska"" feels pure."
13623	3	a	Mehra is brilliant at his craft; he infuses realism into drama, and explores characters so deeply and sensitively through tragedy and triumph, that it sparks an emotional deluge.
13624	4	a	Thing is, it all actually happened.
13625	5	a	From naked models draped in fabric, to private jet passengers draped in dogs, Valentino is a warts and all, fly on the wall insight into the life of one of the great fashion designers. Unfortunately in this flick there are more warts than all.
13626	5	a	Sure, it's kiddie film, but internal consistency would have been a nice touch
13627	5	a	It gives even as fine an actor as Bale little chance to shine among the bullets, bombs and terrified women.
13628	0	a	... bores its way in and lingers for hours, even days before we finally can come to terms with it - and ourselves. But the less we know, the more we understand.
13629	1	a	At times it's grueling, and even difficult to watch, but it's a remarkably powerful film.
13630	4	a	The acting is a mixed bag. Jon Favreau and Faizon Love, who never hit a false note, are the standouts.
13631	5	a	What drove the original was the clash of personalities, but here, when all you have is a just lot of sand, things get pretty dry pretty fast.
13632	4	a	Solid performances from Saoirse Ronan and Margot Robbie make this often sluggish venture somewhat bearable. 
13633	4	a	Visually spectacular with a first-rate cast, I, Frankenstein is hampered by a predictable script.
13634	1	a	Sentimental touches underscore the fun and frivolity of Bond's past while relishing the brutal landscape of the modern day super-spy.
13635	3	a	It's not exactly Tweeter-material to say that Freeman has maintained a high standard of acting excellence for decades, but he truly delivers a memorable performance that channels Mandela expertly from his tone to posture and dignified grace.
13636	4	a	Piccoli in a role that relies on looks, gestures and very few words, does not hit an off note, making him into a silent, everyman figure.
13637	3	a	It's amateurish but gleeful. The zoom-zoom pacing and all-in performances make sure the jokes don't fall on dead air.
13638	5	a	There will be more gags and puns in the reviews of press pundits than could be found in the entirety of this film, which fails to create a bee world of any logic or surprise.
13639	5	a	Pure fairy tale and flimflam, as phony as a fixed fight.
13640	5	a	I don't mean to imply that this film is any good or that it contains an ounce of genuine insight. But as a template for the big-baby genre, it's invaluable.
13641	4	a	Octopussy is a very minor entry in the Bond franchise.
13642	3	a	The Bourne Supremacy is a summer action film... yet it impresses with its intelligence and its willingness to buck convention.
13643	1	a	An emotionally resonant, inventively hilarious movie that, oddly, may be its most family-friendly yet.
13644	1	a	There is minimalistic elegance to this film that couldn't help but blow me away.
13645	0	a	Gyllenhaal's breakthrough performance is simultaneously heartfelt, melancholy and mischievous.
13646	10	a	Not a film so much as a filmed idea. That could be interesting, but alas it is a very bad idea.
13647	4	a	You can almost hear the gears of Blake's moral mechanism churning as character's spit out their maxims.
13648	6	a	A stupid, petulant exercise in racism and misogyny.
13649	3	a	While it's no classic, Vantage Point is well worth a look.
13650	3	a	American Violet dramatizes Kelly's case, and does so in a way that will leave audiences applauding in their seats -- and wondering how much of the film is true.
13651	5	a	Stiff and boring, with only Davis giving it a burst of life.
13652	2	a	Sets medium-range goals for itself, and nails them solidly.
13653	6	a	This halftime walk is more like a long slog.
13654	9	a	Bonello might as well have shown him sleeping eight hours or using the toilet for all that says about the man and his work.
13655	3	a	Like a lot of fast-paced spy films, The Bourne Identity seldom pauses for character development. Fortunately, there's just enough to pull us into the saga, thanks largely to Damon and Potente.
13656	3	a	It Comes at Night is a masterclass in suspense building, it's a film all about the notion of trust, and is so intense, and uncompromising with it.
13657	9	a	Here is the dirty movie of the year, slimy and scummy, and among its casualties is poor Jessica Alba, who is a cutie and shouldn't have been let out to play with these boys.
13658	6	a	"With ""Billy Lynn's Long Halftime Walk,"" Ang Lee deems to make a poignant film, but it is bogged down by too many subplots, bad dialogue, and a general lack of cohesiveness. "
13659	4	a	Mature boxing drama is absorbing, if not original. 
13660	0	a	...depicts the American West as a collision of codes.
13661	5	a	In the end, the film is far less affecting or thought-provoking than the book.
13662	3	a	Stupid, silly fun with a decent amount of gore and heavy dose of teen humor
13663	8	a	This film, however, will fade away quicker than Jenna Jameson when she hits thirty-five. 
13664	4	a	The novel's themes of grief and bravery propel the film towards a visually dark finale that makes the most of Roth's grisly approach to the material.
13665	1	a	Manages to move beyond its bloody rage by spinning a complex narrative that's one of the year's most compelling stories.
13666	3	a	Astute and empathetic, it's a heartfelt, touching, coming-of-middle-age drama.
13667	3	a	"Kore-eda may have moved away from the adventurous, mysterioso moodiness of early films like ""After Life,"" but the smiles he provokes here -- both with his characters and with us -- are well-earned."
13668	9	a	I found this adult animated mockery most unpalatable.
13669	3	a	For what it's worth, the first installment of The Hobbit hits all the right notes and delivers what will be expected of it
13670	2	a	A good movie about a powerful friendship, and it brings a bygone era back to life.
13671	3	a	Loud, smash-and-crash monster movie fun at its finest.
13672	8	a	For sentimentality's sake, it's great watching Reeve and company reprise their roles even if it's in the bastard child edition of the series, but this isn't just one of the worst comic book films, it's one of the worst films ever made.
13673	4	a	The actors successfully personalize the struggle against an unscrupulous authority, building an emotional impact into American Violet.
13674	3	a	A mis-matched buddy movie that really works.
13675	8	a	Functions like an excruciating episode of Jerry Springer.
13676	4	a	Aniston is a revelation; she shows more range and depth here than in any of her previous films, and far more than she's ever shown on Friends.
13677	4	a	Davis is charmingly cynical in the film, and Neill's a winner, but ultimately this period piece gets so caught up in its own cleverness and wannabe shock that it comes off as trite.
13678	0	a	Meticulously detailed and expertly paced and photographed, with sights so spectacular and terrible that viewers will have to consciously remind themselves to close their mouths when their jaws drop open.
13679	4	a	When Bob Rafelson decides to get nasty, he really means it.
13680	2	a	This is the best love story of the year, superbly acted by Blanchett and Mara and directed by Haynes, but there is not much of an edge to the rest of the story.
13681	5	a	It's the filmic equivalent of the young men it represents -- guys who think, talk and brag about sex without ever really getting any.
13682	5	a	Vondie Curtis Hall helmed Gridlock'd, a low-budget buddy thriller starring Tupac Shakur and Tim Roth, with nary a rote moment. This is not the case with Waist Deep, a big-budget thriller with nary an original moment.
13683	6	a	Well-filmed, well-acted and certainly riveting, American Psycho nonetheless is a movie without heart about a man without heart.
13684	4	a	A rather silly affair, but what gives it some distinction is that it actually has some bite.
13685	6	a	...ultimately undone by a relentless emphasis on obvious and downright laughable elements that'll surely leave even the most ingenuous viewer sporadically rolling their eyes.
13686	5	a	[Hall] undermines the early style and intelligence of his all-black action movie, taking audiences for the wrong kind of ride in the end.
13687	5	a	[Bright Star] may have inspired some beautiful poetry but, here, provokes mere yawns.
13688	1	a	This is a beautiful film -- one that is startlingly real. It feels so blisteringly sensual and in the moment, that it's almost impossible to ignore.
13689	0	a	Despite all its pain, love is always worth it, the film argues-and makes you believe.
13690	6	a	Farley and Spade have a definite chemistry, and they do their best to pick up the slack. [Blu-ray]
13691	3	a	It's not exactly brilliantly acted, except by the dinosaurs and raptors - there wasn't time for the usual number of takes.
13692	4	a	We've frankly heard it all before.
13693	4	a	The film is a disquieting and often very funny examination of yuppie unease in the country. The problem is, it's disguised as a dopey suspense thriller.
13694	5	a	Molonoti me ton Lasseter kapoy pano ap' tin paragogi, na tis dinei aroma Pixar, i prototypia tis tainias tis Disney eksantleitai se merika oraia panarismata kai haritomenes gonies tainias drasis sti skinothesia, i asfaleia tis sto problepsimo senario omos
13695	4	a	Stay is crowded with layers and symbols, probably too many for one movie, and it ultimately wears out its welcome. But its images are compelling, even as its story fades away.
13696	8	a	Steven Spielberg's Amistad is a potent, finely crafted drama that explores -- better than any film to date -- the injustices and horror of slavery and the seeds of American civil rights legislation.
13697	3	a	Like Me and Earl and the Dying Girl, The Edge of Seventeen and Easy A, Love, Simon is proof that there is still plenty of life, fun and intelligent storytelling to be had in the high school movie genre.
13698	5	a	Unpleasant exploitative B-movie.
13699	6	a	While the title, trailer and commercials imply that we'll be carefully piecing together clues to a complex assassination attempt as seen from several perspectives, the final product turns out to be a tepid thriller that promises more than it delivers.
13700	5	a	Silly stuff, all mixed up together like a term paper from a kid who can't quite distinguish one sci-fi work from another.
13701	4	a	Coppola's thing is bottling up the California feel of sunny abandon, then marrying it to that way-station period when high school ends and college -- or just real life -- starts.
13702	9	a	Little kids who've never seen this story before might get a kick out of it and its bold colours. Parents will be yawning and looking at their watches. At least G-Force dared you to hate it; this just dares you to stay awake.
13703	5	a	Too confusing to be humorous.
13704	3	a	There is, as you can see, a great deal going on in the film. At the start it feels like the basis for a straightforward thriller. But it's much, much more than that.
13705	5	a	[Asimov] probably would have been 'appalled by' this cartoonish creation.
13706	5	a	An improvement only in that it doesn't feature a single reference to [Steve] Harvey's book.
13707	3	a	[Logan Lucky] is not going to win him any Oscars but Soderbergh certainly appears to have recovered his zest for filmmaking.
13708	6	a	Verbinski substitutes atmosphere for action, tedium for thrills.
13709	3	a	Chicken Run isn't just chock-full of references to classic prison-break movies and some witty inside Hollywood jokes, but is filled with a secret ingredient sadly missing from its super-digitized, merchandise-driven counterparts: heart.
13710	3	a	An unblinking chronicle of the world on the eve of destruction.
13711	3	a	A surprisingly bright-and-breezy affair in which the action moves briskly and with no little humour.
13712	5	a	Albert Nobbs ends up being little more than a play on screen.
13713	2	a	So much fun, you might be tempted to conclude that Disney's acquisition of the amazing Pixar team has inspired the already in-house Disney team to new heights.
13714	0	a	A spirited, energetic, hilarious take on one of the least spirited, energetic, or hilarious topics of all: heroin addition
13715	1	a	a singular piece of generic transgression, making the unmaking of the West-something that filmmakers had been doing to various degrees for decades-feel shockingly, aggressively, and poetically new.
13716	5	a	A Bond film should feature a menacing villain who's also just a touch daffy; Javier Bardem has more fun than anybody else onscreen as a rogue agent with a mommy complex and a come-hither leer.
13717	3	a	For those seeking an intense, seductive and gritty crime drama, Miami Vice delivers the goods.
13718	3	a	Herzog has found a perfect partner in crime with Nicolas Cage.
13719	0	a	It's certainly the most complexly ornery superhero flick we're likely to get this summer.
13720	0	a	A deeply spiritual film about loss, caring, and starting over.
13721	2	a	Baratz's apparent willingness to accept everything at face value papers over some of the more troubling aspects of Tenzin's mission, but Unmistaken Child allows the mysteries of the process to be preserved without judgment.
13722	9	a	"There's little that anyone who doesn't catalog ""Highlander"" kills online could possibly comprehend about this mythology-heavy permutation while mocking its Casio-demo score, junior-high-play scene blocking, Skinemax sex and oafish action sequences."
13723	3	a	It has enough buzzing wit and eye-popping animation to win over the kids -- and probably more than a few parents, too.
13724	1	a	It's the kind of movie that cries out for a second look, because it's easy to admire, hard to actually like and harder still to penetrate
13725	6	a	I suppose I was looking forward to A Million Ways to Die in the West just a little too much for my own good.
13726	0	a	Directed with confidence by Ava DuVernay, it's a movie about how King changed America by having the canny political genius to show the country an image of itself that it could not bear.
13727	6	a	As a film, The Angry Birds Movie is an okay kids' flick, no more no less, but as a video game adaptation it is actually remarkably well done.
13728	0	a	Sweet Sixteen is a wonderfully bittersweet effort, and one of Loach's best works.
13729	0	a	Classic westerns may never go out of style, but sometimes it's good to see a movie about a cowboy who's a full-fledged human and not a type.
13730	2	a	Whatever blooms between the characters either becomes twisted into something monstrous or hinges upon the concealment of a dark secret. It is this perverse growth that threatens to consume from within.
13731	9	a	Matrixian, Orwellian, and boneheadian.
13732	3	a	Polanski rarely indulged in his taste for overwrought slapstick, but here it is.
13733	3	a	[An] unabashedly jingoistic action extravaganza starring Harrison Ford as...'The Ass-Kicking President'...[Blu-ray]
13734	7	a	Slumdog.
13735	4	a	Sometimes Wonderland does make you wonder why you're wasting your time with these losers. But there's also a lot here that stays with you.
13736	5	a	Eastwood's weepy depiction of the 'here' is just as dull and tedious as his superficial exploration of the 'after'.
13737	7	a	Saddles that should blaze in A Million Ways to Die in the West only spit-sizzle, so Mel Brooks is still king, and it's good to be that.
13738	4	a	That sappy sentimentality juxtaposed with plenty of gritty gangster stuff drives both the tone and the plot of Waist Deep.
13739	6	a	Slowly drags viewers through a morass of cardboard caricatures, tedious dialogue, and stultifying skirmishes for over four hours, if you count the previews and intermission.
13740	3	a	An enjoyably inventive low-budget B-movie filled with action and interesting characters.
13741	4	a	"This entry isn't particularly strong, but it isn't terribly weak, either -- it's probably the best of the ""odd number"" Trek movies ever made"
13742	5	a	Disappointing romantic muddle
13743	10	a	About as much fun as being given a wedgie and hung from the camp flagpole.
13744	6	a	Ryan's Kallen is painfully two-dimensional.
13745	0	a	An achingly beautiful, tightly wound package of woe that slowly comes undone over the course of its running time to reveal something very special indeed.
13746	3	a	Perfectly captures the magic of the show. A great follow-up. 
13747	5	a	Unlike 'Gettysburg,' however, 'Gods and Generals' is slow-moving and stilted and is punctuated by speeches rather than drama and action.
13748	3	a	Heavier, with bad teeth and blotchy skin, Theron is nearly unrecognizable in the role. She's also astonishingly good.
13749	3	a	[Apatow] sees love as something that can slip in the back door when the front door is barricaded by common sense.
13750	1	a	A run-on sentence of a puzzle of a fog, wonderfully disoriented and right in line with the behind-the-beat curiosity Phoenix brings to Doc.
13751	3	a	Internal Affairs is, for the dim movie season that is traditionally January, an unusually bright light.
13752	2	a	Capable new performers surround Jackson, including young men who play a believable brand of high-flying basketball.
13753	4	a	Demitri Martin and the movie are perfect for each other, both of them agreeable and inoffensive, likable and sort of funny but not very substantive.
13754	5	a	The movie goes wrong from the start by simply throwing us into the action and asking us to identify with Messing's desperate scheme.
13755	3	a	Mother and Child -- which interestingly never makes an issue of race in its relationships -- is rewarding viewing, even if it's not exactly feel-good entertainment.
13756	2	a	It's one of those films that should be seen by film buffs and those interested in films as history.
13757	4	a	It's an impressively unified vision, with sterile set design, a wonderfully crisp and creepy sound design by Walter Murch.
13758	5	a	One measure of its desperation and lack of respect for its audience is the frequency with which it labors to wring humor from flatulence and excrement gags.
13759	2	a	It's a bit of a mainstream comedy, sure, and for that it sometimes feels slight or conventionally paced, but it's packed with more heart and perception than most, and it treats its characters as fully realized people.
13760	6	a	"The screenwriters dig themselves in deeper every time they toss logic and science into what is essentially a ""Dungeons and Dragons"" fantasy with modern military weaponry..."
13761	3	a	Fantasy and reality blur in a chilling film that shows Jackson's limitless potential
13762	9	a	There's not much that's good in it, plenty that's bad, and an awful lot that's just plain ugly.
13763	3	a	A lush romantic drama where the best elements are the least romantic.
13764	8	a	A joyous return of the cinematic epic.
13765	4	a	Imagine two movies plucked from opposite sides of the video store.
13766	3	a	Don't be surprised to find yourself suddenly obsessed with forgotten names and misplaced keys.
13767	7	a	The film's message is that all of society is corrupt, so it doesn't matter who gets killed. It's a propaganda movie that shows no empathy for its characters or for its audience.
13768	3	a	Trey Parker may not advance the cause of freedom, but he'll go to it laughing, and that's worth several times my buck-o-five.
13769	1	a	There's a touch of Spielbergian magic that transcends the choppy, patchwork narrative. It's very difficult not to have an immense amount of fun with Ready Player One in spite of its flaws.
13770	3	a	A richly nuanced American comedy, with two acting talents working at their absolute peak.
13771	1	a	As in the films of Charlie Chaplin, 'Past' presents the downcast and needy as human beings of worth, humor and dignity...
13772	5	a	Bee Movie is certainly not low-budget, but it has all the staying power and creative value of a B-movie. The secret life of bees, as told by Seinfeld, is a bore with a capital B.
13773	1	a	The movie abounds in stellar moments.
13774	4	a	a very rough but dedicated character study
13775	9	a	An embarrassingly bad comedy.
13776	4	a	What can I write about Two Weeks Notice that I haven't written about every mediocre romantic comedy to come down Hollywood's pipeline?
13777	4	a	The cinematography is stunning as it captures some amazing nature footage, but it's a film that you can easily watch and enjoy at home on video.
13778	3	a	Works because it never tries to be more than the very personal memory piece it is.
13779	1	a	The film is rooted in the most essential truth of all: Carol and Therese need each other in order to become the best people they can be.
13780	1	a	Midnight in Paris finds exactly the right groove for its story and stays there. It's a winner.
13781	9	a	Utterly forgettable, even with its great cast
13782	6	a	Something's missing. Although the movie is tense, it's not the white-knuckle experience you might expect, with the most suspenseful scenes coming across as manufactured.
13783	4	a	It isn't a terrible film by any means, and it's easy to see why people revere it.
13784	2	a	These guys were going for a B-movie feel, lots of blood, lots of guts, lots of tits and ass, and lots of fun, and for the most part, they achieved their goals.
13785	4	a	It was fun.
13786	3	a	Terrific, original and truly unsettling.
13787	3	a	Undoubtedly Daniel Craig's best outing; this is a new kind of Bond film.
13788	8	a	It's so derivative they may as well have named their heroine Rosemary.
13789	5	a	Heder seems perversely bored, unable to hold his eyes open; was that a conscious acting choice, or was he simply reading his lines off the floor?
13790	4	a	What in the world is going on with I Heart Huckabees? Please, someone e-mail me and let me know.
13791	4	a	Tupac Shakur turned in an excellent final performance.
13792	4	a	Unfortunately, Fincher doesn't add much to Niels Arden Oplev's Swedish version: more Googling and plot-compressing montages and an altered but still convoluted ending.
13793	6	a	Depp is stuck playing a witty rake who isn't remarkably witty or even all that sexy.
13794	3	a	Pedro Almodovar's latest outrage against propriety is a body horror comedy, a sort of mash-up of the work of David Cronenberg and The Rocky Horror Picture Show
13795	4	a	Has some great moments along the way, but as a whole never quite comes together
13796	3	a	Even as a strictly superficial survey of Michael Mann's world, there's still an electric charge from all its nabs, jumps and gets. It's not Mann's usual poetry of pushing the existential envelope, but it's a skillful action film.
13797	3	a	Gridlock'd is refreshing because it's different. The subject matter isn't new, but the approach and tone are.
13798	3	a	Then there are the rap sequences where Eminem displays an energy close to unrivaled by any performance this year. In these scenes, he and the film show what they're really made of.
13799	7	a	Black or White is a toxic misstep for racial discourse. It boils a serious, knotty story down into a series of running gags, awkward moments, and grandstanding courtroom dialogues. 
13800	9	a	Mean-spirited, ugly and just not funny.
13801	4	a	Nothing is clear-cut in this intense brew of brutality, stupidity and genuine tragedy. We're left lamenting that it will go on, unless Brazil engages its brain before its fist.
13802	4	a	Wasabi is one of the best times I've had lately enjoying a movie that has no regard for a plot.
13803	3	a	The film is a fascinating record of the evolution of a black musical style, and the tangled motives of the white men who had an instinct for it.
13804	5	a	Call it tastelessness with a message -- a dubious combination, like, for sure. Still, Schneider pulls off the masquerade pretty well.
13805	3	a	"Whiskey Tango Foxtrot"" is by far Tina Fey's best movie. It makes use of her comic sense, but also of her watchful wariness and underlying wistfulness."
13806	6	a	Despite some interesting moments, this feels like a failure. The filmmaking is incredibly bland, the story can't figure out if it's having fun with the weirdness or not, and the Cloverfield tie in is gimmicky, leaving you with more questions than answers.
13807	3	a	A sad, funny, often hypnotic film.
13808	3	a	All the Codes in the world couldn't keep Mae West from being her typical seductive and sexy self.
13809	0	a	Nosferatu remains the best vampire movie of all time. It possesses a strain of sheer dread not captured by any subsequent bloodsucker film.
13810	2	a	...every clear-eyed observation of how adult humans court affection must be pulped and sugared, refined into treacle.
13811	3	a	First Reformed is thought-provoking and one of the best films you will see this year.
13812	4	a	Even if it doesn't match the urgency of the original, it certainly recaptures its energy. [Full review in Portuguese.]
13813	9	a	How are we to be frightened or afraid of these things when they have repeated themselves over and over again for the past two decades?
13814	3	a	To play James Brown, the Godfather of Soul, in Get On Up, cautious just won't cut it. No worries. Boseman tears into the role like a man possessed. You can't take your eyes off him.
13815	6	a	It is, essentially, a goof. A meticulously crafted and exuberantly acted goof, but in the end no more than that.
13816	3	a	Sutherland's performance is the film's treasure.
13817	4	a	The General's Daughter is a well-made thriller with a lot of good acting.
13818	9	a	Its clunky incidents of exposition leave us with no real understanding of what anyone is thinking or feeling.
13819	6	a	To paraphrase a line often misattributed to Samuel Johnson, this Disney-aspires-to-Pixar combination is both original and good; the problem is the original parts aren't good and the good parts aren't original.
13820	6	a	A cute premise with engaging leads but little else to keep you awake.
13821	4	a	Anthony Hopkins dons the facial flab as Hitch, does the voice well enough and the portly-erect, pontifical stature better.
13822	4	a	Such moments are forgiveable, though, in what is ultimately a heart-warming, and thoroughly enjoyable film.
13823	4	a	The film uses its breezy comic tone to makes some raw points about the fidelity, motherhood and compromise.
13824	6	a	It has moments, but it's more of a drag than the zippy supporting cast would suggest.
13825	1	a	...a lyrical, plain-sung movie about people who are obliged to love one another. And do.
13826	3	a	Contrivances and melodrama aside, it is emotionally true and that's often the most important thing for a film of this nature.
13827	5	a	When he's good, Ridley Scott can change filmgoing forever. When he's bad, he's just extremely mediocre. That being the case, Matchstick is then an example of Scott at his worst.
13828	2	a	While it's unlikely that Bleed for This will supplant Rocky in the minds of filmgoers, it's an entertaining reminder that defeat is only a temporary condition.
13829	3	a	The movie avoids most of the pitfalls: Its epiphanies are small ones, but with the gleam of truth.
13830	3	a	Gladiator has all the fixin's for wonderful drama.
13831	2	a	It may not be art, but it's vastly more entertaining than anything Coppola senior has done in far too long.
13832	6	a	...Alfie - when you get right down to it - isn't a terribly likable character, something that certainly makes it difficult to actually care about his fate.
13833	3	a	The most compelling message of this unflinching, powerful, and haunting movie is that in Jesus' name we are obligated to extend our compassion to victims everywhere.
13834	6	a	The story bogs down in several places and is almost too ambitious for a cartoon...but fans of the television show should still be thrilled.
13835	4	a	In the end, one can respect Gibson's high intentions and dedicated work, while remaining spiritually and dramatically unmoved by the result.
13836	3	a	Jean Dujardin stamps his own imprint on the archetype of the slick, dark-haired leading man-he's also a handsome clown who may bring the pencil-thin moustache back into vogue. 
13837	6	a	Early Man relies on a lot of lazy, easy jokes that were never an issue with Park's earlier work.
13838	5	a	The Last Witch Hunter is an unwieldy mishmash, pitched between sword-and-sorcery epic and modern-day action movie.
13839	3	a	The important thing is that the story is absorbing and the characters endearing, so the plot is still exciting despite being predictable, pure Spielberg style. [Full Review in Spanish] 
13840	4	a	The thing is, while I am the first to stand up and shout about the dangers of the climate crisis, I also don't need to be hit over the head with what is going on in the world with a didactic sledgehammer.
13841	3	a	You can feel Terrence Malick drifting away in this follow-up to his acclaimed debut. 
13842	4	a	Approached purely on the surface, Eat serves a sensual cinematic meal.
13843	3	a	The church declined to comment to Berg. Her film speaks volumes about its silence -- and about a wrong that can never be righted.
13844	0	a	A modern-day classic that proves that Hollywood can still make incredible films.
13845	8	a	If cinephilia has a literal holy text, to be referred to and examined in times of joy and stress and sorrow, it is this.
13846	3	a	Stay means to unsettle us, and it does.
13847	3	a	"Excellent performances mark ""The Savages,"" with Linney and Hoffman each navigating characters who could have become unlikable had they not been shaded with nuance."
13848	1	a	Sad? At times. But also very, very funny in other instances.
13849	4	a	Director James Wong enjoys organizing dangerous objects and circumstances into precariously menacing Rube Goldberg arrangements.
13850	4	a	Nothing spectacular but nonetheless rather engaging and entertaining.
13851	6	a	As for the space stuff, well, George Lucas need not lose any sleep.
13852	5	a	This is a lot of pedantic plot for a multiplex farce - and when it barely has room to breathe, you can't really blame it for lacking inspiration.
13853	6	a	I's a bit like a trip to the gym on a flat tire. 
13854	6	a	The demand for the awe that Ang Lee besets upon himself is the film's greatest crime. He focuses too much on building the medium and completely abandons the things that have made him such a prolific director in the first place. 
13855	5	a	This is like a well-worn vintage dress: comfortable but a little threadbare.
13856	3	a	Iridescent and teaming with vitality, Garbo glows in her penultimate film.
13857	3	a	Boldly going where few parodies have gone before.
13858	2	a	Unlike television cartoons that sell their souls to make the leap to the big screen, this animated G-rated film is faithful to Norman Bridwell's beloved book series about the big red dog.
13859	3	a	This hugely entertaining horror fable for all the family might suffer from pacing problems, but it's also a true original that still stands out from today's CGI-heavy crowd.
13860	6	a	It's capable at times of real subtlety and warmth and humanity, but not confident enough in itself to stay away from fart jokes or empty acts of sassiness for very long.
13861	1	a	Whether they act with cowardice or courage, the characters are invariably complex.
13862	5	a	Save it for a six-pack and pizza night with the lads -- when there's no footy on TV.
13863	4	a	It's a sometimes likeable little film. But, like a small plane that never obtains liftoff, the movie seems happy to spend all of its time just taxiing around the runway.
13864	5	a	In a quarter of a century who's even going to remember that Tom Cruise went on Oprah's show and made an ass of himself?
13865	4	a	Joshua Z. Weinstein's film is very modest but never less than interesting in the insights it offers into this rarefied world on the edge of Manhattan.
13866	1	a	The scenes with Hawke, Cedric, and Gaston are improbably tense, in part because each character is given a rich and forceful voice in a way that has becoming increasingly rare in modern movies.
13867	6	a	"Cranston is the best possible actor for the story, of course, having navigated the same terrain in a far more engaging fashion in ""Bad,"" but even his quality work plays like a second-rate leftover."
13868	9	a	A hollow history lesson and an adventure that's about as thrilling as the staged joust at the heart of those traveling Renaissance Festivals.
13869	4	a	A Perfect Getaway is proof that a dumb idea can be brought to life, however briefly, by smart people, and writer-director David Twohy is nothing if not clever.
13870	1	a	The briskly paced, high-spirited movie is complemented by a funny score that includes the old disco hit You Sexy Thing.
13871	1	a	Hitchcock would have loved it.
13872	3	a	Though it never ventures past the tourist quarters of Paris, this is one of Woody's most handsomely photographed movies.
13873	4	a	full review at Movies for the Masses
13874	3	a	The Princess Blade boasts some of the most dazzling fight choreography in recent memory.
13875	6	a	Too bad the principal character lacks the charisma to carry the movie.
13876	3	a	Liman is a surprisingly good action director, making even the most routine spectacle seem a little more interesting than it probably should be
13877	0	a	Spielberg uses stark, brutal realism to put over his powerful points about racism and ethnic cleansing, and the use of stunning black-and-white photography and gritty hand-held camera footage give the film a potent documentary style.
13878	1	a	Three Billboards may be a film chiefly concerned with rage, and pain, but it's also one of the best dark comedies of recent vintage, and one of the better dramas as well.
13879	3	a	An ebullient toast to grande dames: part homage, part camp, all artifice and a thoroughly entertaining, if light, confection.
13880	0	a	the wunderkind director's latest in a growing line of masterpieces.
13881	8	a	Pardon me for the Joel Siegel moment, but it's all pretty fricking incredible.
13882	5	a	This romp just isn't funny or original enough to become a holiday classic. Although the solid cast makes it watchable.
13883	4	a	An attractive and intelligent new chapter of the relations between cinema and food culture to offer us a film about the flavor of life. [Full review in Spanish]
13884	0	a	The bottom line is that The Passion of the Christ is an astonishing cinematic achievement, utterly riveting from start to finish.
13885	3	a	Incredibly funny.
13886	2	a	So entrenched in anguish that you'll leave feeling empty and unhappy.
13887	4	a	Though the film's action scenes won't win awards for originality, they can't be faulted for either their scale or love of slo-mo.
13888	1	a	For the right kind of romantic, Safety Not Guaranteed offers pure outsider catharsis.
13889	2	a	Crimson Peak has a lot going for it, and may well be the most ravishing horror movie ever made.
13890	5	a	A well-meaning misfire, this SoCal coming-of-age tale tries to be both a broad teen farce and a sensitive family drama.
13891	2	a	A scattershot affair that mixes MacFarlane's characteristically crass and off-kilter sense of humor with sentimentality and affable goofiness.
13892	4	a	...saved from being substandard Tyler Perry material by the sincere performances of the two stars...
13893	3	a	If Hoffman's splendid, subtle performance might not be the apex of his wide-ranging career, this intelligent, engrossing film proves a fitting finale to it.
13894	0	a	LaBute didn't write Nurse Betty, but his fierce comic touch is, luckily, all over this movie.
13895	2	a	The superb cast certainly deserves much of the credit for that success.
13896	4	a	The film isn't willing to completely face the bleakness of its allegory faith versus skepticism. 
13897	3	a	Even [Eminem's] most devoted admirers likely will be surprised by his ability to keenly render and compellingly sustain a character throughout a feature-length film.
13898	2	a	Here is a film unapologetic in its attempts to go for the emotional jugular vein. 
13899	6	a	Even fans of the series may be disappointed.
13900	6	a	There's very little pay-off to this overlong and murky psychological thriller.
13901	4	a	The Way Back is a hefty cinematic experience set against the vast vistas of history that may not have you cheering on its heroes at every turn, but that will enthrall you in their epic journey nonetheless.
13902	3	a	Reflective of James Brown's invigorating, transcendent music, Tate Taylor's Get on Up blares and bangs its way through the iconic soul singer's life, kept on beat by star Chadwick Boseman's explosive energy.
13903	4	a	At times, the suspense is palpable, but by the end there's a sense that the crux of the mystery hinges on a technicality that strains credulity and leaves the viewer haunted by the waste of potential.
13904	3	a	Doubling as a fascinating look at a subculture that is normally sealed off from the rest of us and a gently amusing comedy of manners, this manages to say an awful lot by, paradoxically, saying it endearingly gently.
13905	5	a	The visuals impress, the script does not and, bar one great chase sequence rammed full of visual gags, fails to make the most of its setting.
13906	4	a	Jackie Chan's East-meets-Western action comedy is surprising fun.
13907	3	a	While the storyline is somewhat disjointed, the music really shines.
13908	3	a	Chicken Run, Aardman's first full-length animated feature, finally makes good on the promise of the studio's award-winning shorts.
13909	2	a	a strange cross between Get Shorty and Office Space, yet having its own unique flavor
13910	5	a	Here, while the routines are as polished as ever, everything else is tired, not least Fat Amy's fat jokes. Time for a new song, ladies.
13911	5	a	...has the aura of a penny-dreadful bodice-ripper.
13912	2	a	Too bad the storytelling, which is somewhat disjointed, isn't as good as the rest of the deal -- but Don Cheadle is so good at what he does you probably won't even notice.
13913	1	a	Paris Can Wait is a decidedly intimate piece of storytelling that contrasts quite nicely from the bolder and more dramatic features from the other members of the Coppola clan.
13914	1	a	At its best, the new movie about King cracks the civil rights leader and his associates from their plaster-saint cocoons. 
13915	4	a	Sayles keeps crankin' 'em out: socially conscious, diversity-embracing ensemble pieces... This one is minor and sketchy...
13916	6	a	It's all external trappings trying to express internal developments, and the movie's hand-holding stridency just emphasizes the artificiality of its fantasy.
13917	3	a	Streep and Eastwood's chemistry makes the film.
13918	2	a	Nolan's slick sleight of hand creates enough abracadabra moments to make for an entertaining diversion.
13919	5	a	has energy, but as a farce it falls flat because it has no tone and no center
13920	9	a	Forster presents to us the despair of the world as a soulless, Euro-trashy video installation.
13921	4	a	A friendly, joke-stuffed animated feature.
13922	3	a	An intensely personal, extremely precise meditation on fear, grief, family and community ... challenging stuff that bears intellectual rigour, or, to put it another way: if you're not willing to think about it, you probably won't like it.
13923	0	a	One of the most profound filmmaking experiences of my lifetime.
13924	5	a	This third movie in the Cloverfield series deflects attention from a giant monster and instead focuses on an odd, unstable mishmash of moods and tones, gamely held together by a fine cast. 
13925	0	a	An intensely personal meditation on the nature of heroism and moral choice, rendered on the kind of rich, dreamlike cinematic canvas that only Hollywood can realize.
13926	3	a	The actors have found mutual subcurrents to their characters that project familial affection even when they are at each other's throats.
13927	6	a	The Darkest Minds is what happens when a genre has become stagnant. [Full Review in Spanish]
13928	4	a	Good cheesy fun. One of Snipes' best.
13929	3	a	Entertainment for the whole dysfunctional family.
13930	8	a	At its best, the first-thing-we-do-in-a-dystopian-world-is-kill-teenagers genre hasn't been a shining moment in filmmaking. But now that genetic drift has set in, it's dead-genre-walking, with The Darkest Minds as Exhibit A.
13931	4	a	The literal adaptation doesn't transfer that well to film.
13932	6	a	The film is just not very funny or original.
13933	4	a	The imminently likeable and gentlemanly [Spencer] Stone is the leader here and he has real screen presence. 
13934	3	a	A challenging character study, punctuated by moments of uneasy suspense and dark humor.
13935	0	a	This is one of the year's most subtly moving films, and a strong affirmation of Coppola's substantial talent.
13936	3	a	A solid picture that is probably accessible to a wider audience than Pulp Fiction was...
13937	5	a	To say this snoozy, awkward movie is an 'acting showcase' would be unfair to the vastly superior work these performers have done elsewhere.
13938	2	a	...a metaphor for obsessive filmmaking and the film industry's penchant for devouring its own talent...a sly, often funny, yet affectionate send-up of the genre.
13939	1	a	The Edge of Seventeen cuts deep, humor and tears bursting forth in equal measure making the movie a singular joy audience of all ages are almost certain to delight in.
13940	4	a	Paradise-set thriller is stylish, slick, and very violent.
13941	3	a	When it peeks behind the scenes, the movie can be very, very funny.
13942	6	a	It all falls to Farley, who plays a good bonehead but isn't quite ready for prime time.
13943	5	a	Moves from mopey drama one moment to a reaction shot of a monkey smacking his forehead in exasperation the next. By the end of the film, viewers might understand the monkey's feelings all too well.
13944	4	a	Faced with such an enthusiastic fanbase, all that director David Ellis had to do was deliver on the promise of his brilliant title, and he has done exactly that.
13945	3	a	It's not necessarily the movie we expect it to be, and Spacek doesn't necessarily play the role we expect from her. It's a movie about adults making some hard choices, facing some inflexible realities in their lives.
13946	1	a	Generally, documentaries aren't known for dramatic moments, yet the tension is palpable as an anxious Bill Paxton sinks two and a half miles to the bottom of the sea.
13947	6	a	The who's-bilking-whom mind games make for compelling fun, but once the presto moment of The Prestige is revealed, you're left with nothing but shattered illusions.
13948	4	a	Ponderous, despite a couple of nice performances.
13949	2	a	More satisfying as a straight-ahead blow 'em up than as a satire.
13950	1	a	"For a movie that seems at times to have no idea what it's trying to do, ""Silver Linings Playbook"" is compulsively watchable."
13951	1	a	Reitman did well with his casting, turning in one of the most original comedies ever.
13952	4	a	A film more concerned with 'how' than 'why' or 'who', Valkyrie would have benefited from more scrutiny and complexity. Still, once the bomb goes off, the thrills come in spades.
13953	4	a	May be the most efficiently built engine of escalating terror you will ever encounter. But Spielberg's technique serves no purpose this time except the visceral.
13954	5	a	Okay, everybody, back to your shopping--there's nothing to see here.
13955	9	a	Don't waste your time boarding this Flight.
13956	0	a	Young Jandreau gives a towering performance, broody, watchful, charismatic. 
13957	5	a	I was mostly on board with Whiskey Tango Foxtrot until its third act, when it completely derails. Kim, confronted with a serious personal crisis, does something that's frankly unbelievable and baffling.
13958	6	a	There is much here to admire, but the overall impression is of a film that does not have the courage of its convictions.
13959	4	a	The movie is well-made and likable, without any major missteps. It's also just a little bland.
13960	6	a	In a spy flick, we want to see action. We want to see Jason Bourne jumping off a roof. We want tension, not realism-not smoking and meetings and yakking. 
13961	5	a	It gets a little funnier toward the end, making up for the draggy first half . . . However, the shelf-life of this Sweetheart should be short indeed.
13962	4	a	Sticklers for historical accuracy are forewarned: This glossy production plays fast and loose with the facts, abbreviating, altering and excising entire character arcs and plot lines.
13963	6	a	An adventure movie without two brain cells to rub together. But Connery's sad and reflective acting gives the movie depth and poignancy.
13964	3	a	I Origins addresses its subject with the kind of bright-eyed earnestness normally seen only in spaniels and MA students.
13965	9	a	In Man of the Year, a thriller without thrills collides with a mirthless comedy.
13966	6	a	This film's cold, almost robotic conception of Salander as a twitchy, anorexic waif feels more like a stunt than a complete character, and so the best part of the reason we care enough to endure all that mayhem has gone away.
13967	7	a	full review in Greek
13968	4	a	Overall an interesting and at times very gripping film, but one that perhaps could have done with taking a few more risks
13969	3	a	Spielberg and his team are master filmmakers, and it's a pleasure to see them work
13970	4	a	Those familiar with the series will be quite pleased that there were some interesting ideas behind the fun adventures. It was a pleasure to see what was really happening and also to return to the characters of the series. But objectively I cannot recommen
13971	5	a	For those who like their sci-fi to have the depth and breadth of comic books.
13972	4	a	Flightplan never attains liftoff since its basic premise is never made credible, even for a minute.
13973	4	a	Perhaps something of a disappointment in the grand scale of Aardman achievements, it remains pleasant and periodically inspired.
13974	0	a	The situations are so painful sometimes that its almost as if Apatow sat down and made a list of the things that create friction between men and women and then wrote a script around that.
13975	1	a	Revolutionary Road's existential dread of unspoken feelings bubbling to the surface perhaps better resembles Tennessee Williams, a towering explorer of authenticity and self-delusion.
13976	5	a	Quit it with the CGI blood spurts. 
13977	8	a	the type of broad, fish out of water comedy where each crossed signal is telegraphed a mile away and the lead character falls down a lot
13978	6	a	The actors mostly lean hard on comical redneck accents, and the slow-moving plot features way too many leaps of logic.
13979	3	a	Without Limits makes for an engrossing examination of the will to win, the importance of icons in American sports, and the interference of money in amateur athletics.
13980	5	a	There are real issues here that need to be explored -- the neurosis of fame and its consequent personal and relational stresses -- but Country Strong gives them only surface treatment.
13981	0	a	Instead of cheering, I'll keep my mouth shut and give a silent nod of approval.
13982	6	a	Whether on Earth or in space, the jokes are either flat or hopelessly crude.
13983	3	a	Nicole Beharie makes one of the most thrilling feature film debuts in years.
13984	1	a	Baubles of humor, gorgeous shots of the city and sparse use of dialogue relay the warm tale, as Johansson and Murray gracefully embrace the concept.
13985	4	a	In Thor Freudenthal's heartwarming wag based on Lois Duncan's book, the strays aren't your usual mangy curs but well-groomed pedigreed show dogs who're aw-shucks cute.
13986	5	a	Manages to be somewhat well-acted, not badly art-directed and utterly unengaging no matter how hard it tries to be thrilling, touching or, yikes, uproarious.
13987	5	a	A stale effort that seems content to find its niche in a harmless mediocrity.
13988	4	a	As Sausage Party breaks out of its Pixar-inspired packaging, so to speak, its repetitiveness evolves into a delirious cacophony of obscenities.
13989	4	a	Surprisingly, it's Vanessa Hudgens who brings the film to life, creating an original and believable brooding teen. 
13990	7	a	"[Smith] should have pushed for a rewrite as ""Hancock"" only flies so far before degenerating into a lame and illogical ""My Super Ex-Girlfriend."
13991	6	a	Alternately frustrating and disappointing, Casa de los Babys is truly one of Sayles' lesser efforts.
13992	0	a	It seems to be Blake's name as much as anything that propels the character deep into a strange frontier where Blakean ideals of innocence and integrity have been obliterated by ignorance and cruelty. 
13993	4	a	Initially compelling with a fine ensemble cast and impressive cinematography, but suffers from an often bland screenplay that's deficient in character development, imagination and emotional resonance.
13994	6	a	This is one of those ludicrous, semi-offensive, semi-entertaining potboilers that feels as if the script were dragged out from someone's naughty-book stash.
13995	6	a	...a film that can't make up its mind what it wants to be: a comedy, a melodrama, a crime thriller, or a documentary.
13996	3	a	Depending upon your tolerance for cinema as meditation, this moody trek to the inevitable murder of the outlaw Jesse James may actually seem as long as its title. Yet there's much to admire.
13997	0	a	Give all the awards to McDormand, and then invent a bunch of new ones for her too.
13998	1	a	One of creepiest, scariest movies to come along in a long, long time, easily rivaling Blair Witch or The Others.
13999	5	a	Becomes unintentionally funny by the grotesque closing stretch.
14000	2	a	If it could've been a little more stupid, it would've been bad-good. It's worth a look for those who love bad cinema. 
14001	2	a	The humor arises from the situations and the characters, not from an overeager screenwriter's determination to cram as many jokes and putdowns into the script as possible.
14002	9	a	Perhaps no one could have saved Phoenix, who was not lucky enough to find a higher bottom than death. But this performance in this movie should have been seen by someone as a cry for help.
14003	5	a	Rock the Kasbah isn't horrible as much as it's just horribly misguided.
14004	0	a	Kubrick has created a sinister noir film.
14005	6	a	The whole thing is nothing more than an extremely well-designed and wonderfully shot shooting gallery, and if that's your cup of tea then you'll certainly drink your fill with this one.
14006	5	a	Trots out standard romantic-comedy characters and situations. 
14007	3	a	Masterful. Archetypal Westerns don't get any better.
14008	1	a	I was pleasantly surprised, no, make that impressed, with Mary Harron's adaptation of Bret Easton Ellis' notorious novel.
14009	0	a	American Hustle is a movie built on that cornerstone of the American Dream, reinvention. If you're not happy with who you are, or who people think you are, then go ahead and become somebody else. Anything to survive - and thrive.
14010	4	a	Old fashioned and obvious, but genuinely hair-raising and stylishly gruesome. 
14011	6	a	The future never looked as retro...
14012	4	a	The set up is so good that it pains me to say that the last half hour falls apart. Once things are revealed, it becomes too silly.
14013	1	a	In a year of remarkable performances, Oyelowo is simply magnificent as Dr. King.
14014	2	a	Taking Woodstock takes us behind the scenes at that amazing event, and deals with ordinary people swept up in it. Don't expect concert scenes, because there are none.
14015	5	a	According to the script, Grant and Bullock's characters are made for each other. But you'd never guess that from the performances.
14016	1	a	Pegg and Wright's movies laugh, bleed and explode in the face of maturity, even as they begrudgingly recognize the virtue of it.
14017	4	a	It is pleasant enough, as a character study of Elio, but it doesn't offer much in terms of dramatic payoff.
14018	0	a	savage whimsy
14019	5	a	The plot also conspires to harm the film's general credibility.
14020	3	a	Once upon a time, the Disney studios showed off a clever way to blend animation and live action.
14021	3	a	...an opiate-induced, caffeinated, super-octane trip.
14022	2	a	...provides wondrous surprises around every turn.
14023	6	a	Lacks the driving unity that gave Gettysburg its focus, dramatic arc, climax and catharsis.
14024	8	a	It is based on a video game, and as such, it exists merely to go from one life-or-death scenario to the next.
14025	5	a	...Second-rate teen comedy...
14026	5	a	All [the movie] proves is that if you're going to make a road movie rom-com, you should invite Vanessa Redgrave to tag along on the journey...Her grace and charm overshadow all else in it.
14027	8	a	...a situational comedy in which the only funny thing is the fact that decent human beings allowed themselves to be associated with it.
14028	1	a	In this exceptional film, mercifully free of the usual warm and fuzzy movie sentimentality, director Maggie Greenwald and her fine cast shatter most hillbilly stereotypes.
14029	6	a	As predictable as paint-by- numbers, but somehow it seems unlikely that viewers will watch this one in hopes of following a masterful plot.
14030	1	a	[The narrative is] as speedy and graceful as the skateboarders it lingers over in Paranoid Park, where their daredevil moves are often shot in dreamily beautiful slow motion.
14031	5	a	This terrible sequel to a bad movie was directed by Fred Savage, the now-grown star of The Wonder Years, though there's no evidence of any behind-the-scenes adult supervision.
14032	3	a	But what if the mask of your neighbor tilts for a second and you catch a glimpse of the riot going on behind his face? What if you accidentally see the monster feasting on his prey? Now what if you're looking in the mirror?
14033	7	a	From the lowest-common-denominator, hate-speech shock value of the dialogue to the third-act insertion of a rapist ex machina, Three Billboards ... is genuinely loathsome.
14034	2	a	The movie rises thanks to an ace in the hole: Bryan Cranston, whose stirring star turn hooks us completely.
14035	6	a	Overall, it plays like the world's longest -- over two hours -- after-school special.
14036	3	a	Vantage Point makes nice use of the heft of Dennis Quaid, Forest Whitaker, William Hurt and Sigourney Weaver in a story in which an assassination followed by an explosion gets revisited from eight points of view.
14037	1	a	Amistad is an earnest examination of one race's fight for their rights and their freedom.
14038	3	a	A sweeping, glorious-looking western that's at least a full generation removed from the classic films it brings to mind.
14039	3	a	The film trades in subdued emotions and subtle currents of longing that are deeply felt.
14040	3	a	Surprisingly funny, even heartwarming.
14041	5	a	Any initial gestures toward acknowledging Vinny Paz's macho egotism are eventually downplayed as the film becomes just another formulaic triumph-over-adversity saga.
14042	4	a	Darker, scarier, funnier and more fun-filled.
14043	3	a	Even at its most ludicrous, Black Snake Moan stays somehow believable. You think, 'I can't believe I'm buying this,' but the fact remains, you're buying it.
14044	9	a	Believe the bad buzz on this houseflies-become-astronauts CG animation, which is lousy with lazy jokes and irritating characters.
14045	4	a	The animated sequences are disappointingly flat, the real-life parts underwritten, but Amy Adams works hard and keeps a straight face in the lead, and the time passes amiably enough.
14046	6	a	After something goes horribly wrong at a science lab, Martian monsters get to smell what The Rock is cookin'
14047	3	a	I like a movie that is, like its leads, endearingly messy and subverts our genre expectations. Brooks colors outside the lines. 
14048	3	a	The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey looks like the start of another blockbuster trilogy.
14049	3	a	A vibrant vision but a long slog.
14050	4	a	It's one of the year's truly outstanding performances, even if the movie never quite penetrates Brown's rhino-rough hide.
14051	4	a	The film is a bit uneven at times, but when it's firing on all cylinders, The Green Hornet is far too entertaining not to enjoy. 
14052	6	a	Surprisingly sanitized version of the Swedish blockbuster has little resonance in this Americanized form. Stick with with Swedish version - both book and film.
14053	3	a	Penn's best movie to date rests on a brilliant performance by Hirsch, who gets under the skin of the fascinating character at the centre of the piece.
14054	4	a	As fun as it is to watch, this isn't Tolkien's Hobbit. The story of a peaceable traveler who knew the virtue of restraint is lost to the vision of filmmakers who have none.
14055	3	a	Relentlessly pokes fun at the rabid fans of sci-fi geekdom and the has-been actors that they deify . . . yet gives the geeks and has-beens get a chance to become real heroes
14056	1	a	All the characters in the film speak as people in today's modern society speak, and I would argue that's one of the things that make The Last Temptation of Christ so approachable.
14057	3	a	The subject matter may be tough, and the end-point inevitable, but the message we take away is defiant and ultimately uplifting.
14058	3	a	Mazer has an unsparing skill at pushing comic situations to the pain barrier and beyond.
14059	9	a	This film is not the worst Spade has ever made. Remember Joe Dirt? Unfortunately, Dickie Roberts is just another forgettable film in his desperately-seeking -a-feature -film-career oeuvre.
14060	5	a	If Identity Thief suffers from comedic recession, Melissa McCarthy is too small a stimulus package.
14061	4	a	A story about the differences between leading and being led, to see il Papa on a bendy bus is worth the admission alone.
14062	4	a	Amazing how altering one vowel from the king of all cuss words can spawn a movie franchise.
14063	6	a	If a movie is going to tell the story of a wild and crazy night out on the town, the night on the town at least should be convincingly wild and crazy.
14064	3	a	Burton's breakthrough film. Marred by boring leads.
14065	4	a	There's a raw, uncensored power here -- in the film in general and in newcomer Compston in particular.
14066	3	a	Linklater's finessing of acting ensembles is very proficient -- again.
14067	3	a	I'll admit that I was kinda nervous that Invictus would be more melodramatic than the fallout of Tiger Woods accidentally over-tipping an Applebee's waitress...
14068	4	a	"It's a thin line between ""self-aware"" and ""self-involved"" and it's one the movie treads uncertainly."
14069	5	a	A minor film noir about a cold-hearted femme fatale ...
14070	4	a	Brad Pitt is growing as an actor but his lack of chemistry with Blanchett robs the movie of its emotional core
14071	10	a	"The movie doesn't end so much as stop, while promising at least one sequel. But here's a wild guess: This is the last you'll be hearing about ""The Darkest Minds."
14072	3	a	Despite its flaws, this is a compelling motion picture, and offers the kind of 'fresh' experience extended by the likes of Pi and The Sticky Fingers of Time.
14073	0	a	Examines a soulless America that can't live with or without violence.
14074	3	a	A singular film-maker returns from a cinematic sabbatical in qualified triumph. We're lucky to have him.
14075	5	a	Audience members probably fluttered their eyes in disbelief at this convoluted tale.
14076	6	a	Unfortunately, against that impressive backdrop, Pollack mounts a film that is lifeless and slow-moving, offering neither a compelling love story nor a tense tale of a city in turmoil.
14077	8	a	A monument to cinematic suckiness.
14078	3	a	Producer Joan Harrison, who seems to have profited from a long association with Alfred Hitchcock, and Director Irving Pichel have created mounting suspense which comes to a distinctly surprising and explosive climax as the jury brings its verdict.
14079	6	a	...a novel idea that gets stretched way too thin.
14080	9	a	Cohen really blood sucked his idea on this one
14081	5	a	The story is filled with plenty of drama on its own, but director Bruce Beresford and screenwriter Jan Sardi somehow take this true story and make it feel manufactured and manipulative.
14082	2	a	With a deliberately preposterous storyline involving burning bodies, evil brothers, rape, suicide, revenge, sexual identity and medical procedure, this is darkly comic arthouse soap - with a tinge of horror - and definitely an acquired taste.
14083	9	a	It's a blarney bath from the word go, with unbearably winsome characters spinning out Irishisms by the yard.
14084	5	a	Another sorry chapter in Hollywood's infatuation with video games, Doom is basically a deadly dull rehash of Resident Evil, which in turn was a third-generation clone of Aliens.
14085	5	a	Whose story is this? Nobody's. We don't know whom we're meant to root for...
14086	6	a	It's not like I'm asking for The Road Warrior... just some basic coverage and a less-than-total reliance on camera movement to generate excitement.
14087	3	a	A bit soapy, yes, but it's high quality soap.
14088	2	a	Seedy, drug-fueled, and absent any type of sense we're used to in film, Inherent Vice is a film destined to divide any audience that watches it.
14089	2	a	A witty, gentle, breezy, low-brow, low-key comedy ... .
14090	3	a	Law's best scenes are when he doggedly tries to keep smiling as his lifestyle grows grim and depressing.
14091	4	a	Depp gives a dazzling tour de force as a man who loses his soul, then his heart, then his body.
14092	5	a	I, Robot is a disappointment not because of what it is, but because of what it could have been.
14093	5	a	If only the whole script had been as sharp as some of Cusack's caustic one-liners, then this might have appealed to more than just the Chardonnay brigade.
14094	7	a	Reminsicient of nothing more than several wealthy persons' salaried vacation trip, Into the Blue is an absolutely merciless chore of a movie.
14095	4	a	Allen's foray into the real world after his transformation begins is the funniest part of the movie.
14096	7	a	The gnawing familiarity of the formula has caught up with the series. Perhaps it's time that Morgan and Wong took the first word of the title seriously and moved on.
14097	3	a	A refreshingly unsentimental tale of family bonding that unfolds at the leisurely pace of a lazy Sunday afternoon.
14098	0	a	One of the big screen's very greatest thrill-rides.
14099	4	a	What the protagonists do is simply wrong, and their attempts to fix it are first tepid, then unpleasant.
14100	9	a	The impoverishment here is not merely of means, but of spirit.
14101	3	a	giddy, goofy, random, crude and rude, and it is often side-splittingly hilarious
14102	9	a	"The moment of the film when you should be going ""oh my god I can't believe it,"" you're thinking, ""I wonder if we could sneak into the end of Beverly Hills Chihuahua."
14103	2	a	A little bit sanitized for such a serious subject. Coulda been deeper. Wonderful performances - especially from Nick Robinson - make this one a winner. 
14104	1	a	Ron Howard's pop-entertainment you-are-there space thriller is easily the most rousing film of the year. And it might make real spaceflight just as nifty as Star Wars for youngsters.
14105	4	a	Decent enough action-thriller even with poor Tom's baggage.
14106	4	a	Mildly engaging but well acted romantic melodrama, especially by James Garner, who received his first and only Best Actor Oscar nomination for playing a small-town pharmacist.
14107	2	a	A feast for the eyes from beginning to end.
14108	3	a	Wristcutters is a small film of ambitions nicely scaled to the performances and story. Who knew that affectless characters could be so oddly affecting?
14109	3	a	A life-affirming movie about suicide could go wrong in a million ways, but the understated Wristcutters straddles the line between sentiment and bleakness. It should enjoy a healthy afterlife.
14110	1	a	An intense sci fi experience that should satisfy viewers who crave both expensive special effects and intimate human drama, assuming that such an audience exists.
14111	5	a	Imagine Emmanuelle remade on a shoestring budget or Eyes Wide Shut staged by a community theater group.
14112	1	a	A moving, unsettling, and ultimately unforgettable cinematic experience.
14113	0	a	Menashe is utterly absorbing, deeply charming, and very funny. It's an impressive first narrative feature by documentarian Joshua Z Weinstein, who brings an assured intimacy to the screen from the outset.
14114	9	a	The film demeans women in almost every single way imaginable, relying upon crass and sickly stereotypes which could make a Stepford Wife look like a Camille Paglia feminist.
14115	7	a	The empty chairs have taken over.
14116	9	a	This one is dumber than a bag of coffin nails, despite the directing hand of Christophe Gans.
14117	3	a	...an old-fashioned love story for adults.
14118	4	a	Based on the infamous Panhandle Regional Narcotics Task Force case in Tulia, Texas, American Violet makes clear the corruption and racism that pervades the official structures of its fictional town.
14119	6	a	A Series of Unfortunate Events meets Goosebumps and Harry Potter, only without bringing anything new or surprising to its witchy, haunted house narrative.
14120	9	a	There's not much ... development.
14121	4	a	One of those hip, self-consciously trippy existential thrillers that blow in from Europe every now and then to rock the world of East Village university students looking for a superficially meaningful event to legitimize their Friday night bar crawl.
14122	5	a	Mostly the movie is an excuse for Binder to set up straw-man arguments and tear them down disingenuously.
14123	3	a	The finest example of Tim Burton's work as a director and a role that Johnny Depp will have to go a long way to better.
14124	9	a	Aside from a relatively brief appearance by Joan Cusack's avatar as the kidnapped mother, there are no involving characters or situations.
14125	4	a	Its gore is admirably done, and thankfully the effects are practical, but they don't add to the proceedings, delivered with more of a shrug than a purpose. 
14126	6	a	Packed with too many storylines, this drama feels like a zoo indeed.
14127	8	a	This isn't just a train wreck. It's the sound of Clint Eastwood's career death knell.
14128	0	a	A quiet, devastating poignancy that gently envelops you en route to an absolute tear-streamer of an ending.
14129	0	a	There are no plot-altering additions or subtractions. But the digitally spruced print is gorgeous to look at and listen to.
14130	3	a	With fine acting all around, and Fincher's typically meticulous filmmaking engagingly, if coldly, transportive above and beyond Roth's mediocre script, The Curious Case of Benjamin Button bears examining. [Blu-ray]
14131	0	a	A frolicsome rural crime thriller.
14132	6	a	Miller's touching performance is hamstrung by director George Hickenlooper's disconnected narrative and his overdone efforts to make the film look as messy and dirty as Warhol's underground films.
14133	4	a	"In the end, it's all a bit too slight and self-pitying to truly engage our interest; not so much ""Less Than Zero"" as less than compelling."
14134	3	a	In the course of the story, about drug traffickers, Mr. Chan gets three separate birthday cakes thrown into his face, and participates in several elaborately staged gun fights and car chases.
14135	1	a	"A bold, visually exuberant fusion of provocative adult content with an art form too often chalked up as being strictly for kids, ""Sausage Party"" is something special."
14136	6	a	Jerry Seinfeld returns to the mainstream spotlight with Bee Movie, which proves as awkward and ineffective as George Costanza's attempts to wear a toupee.
14137	3	a	One of the year's most watchable movies, particularly for film buffs.
14138	4	a	After an hour of intense disorientation, the movie's arch sarcasm becomes oddly entertaining.
14139	0	a	Kaurismaki is Finland's greatest filmmaker, and never has he more artfully balanced his patented blend of deadpan humor, low-key melodrama, and toe-tapping music.
14140	4	a	Both sincere and cynical in its view of country stardom, it makes you forgive all of its false notes simply because the talent plays them with conviction. 
14141	3	a	Likely no one will be surprised at the trajectory of The Edge of Seventeen's plot and where it ends up, but it has heart, raw emotion, and fantastic performances
14142	5	a	Too mature for little kids and much too corny for older siblings and chaperones, Barnyard probably should have been put out to pasture long before it made it to the multiplex.
14143	4	a	It might be an empty vessel, but it zooms.
14144	5	a	A satire that sets its sights too high and elicits only a few laughs here and there.
14145	6	a	Preaching to the choir and doing so in shorthand.
14146	2	a	A timely little slice of desolation.
14147	1	a	Even with a third eye on your forehead and peyote in your bloodstream, you won't be able to follow this long and winding road any better than Doc does.
14148	5	a	The film becomes something of a meandering mess of scenes that never adds up to a cohesive whole, stretching on and on for an unforgivable two and a half hours.
14149	2	a	Boseman nails Brown's idiosyncratic style of speaking, and, although no one is Brown, he has some pretty swell dance moves.
14150	9	a	All the performers deserve better than this.
14151	3	a	Strangely, the inspirational power of The Soloist lies not in its music but in the heart and soul of its intriguing characters.
14152	1	a	Takes a provocative subject -- friendship and love between a Jew and a Muslim -- and makes it seem natural and wondrous.
14153	6	a	Unfortunately, director Mary Harron and screenwriter Guinevere Turner have also de-fanged the non-violent remainder of Ellis' free-floating narrative..
14154	5	a	Forgettable camp comedy is fine for kiddie laughs.
14155	4	a	Trite, contrived, but often entertaining.
14156	9	a	After this installment, I pray that this the End.
14157	5	a	Everyone needs love and a home, whether kids or animals, is the cheesy but entirely heartfelt message of this fairly predictable and old-fashioned kids' movie.
14158	2	a	A wondrous childlike odyssey, Christopher Robin is recommended both for the young and the young at heart.
14159	0	a	"Not satisfied with just being one of the best thrillers I've ever seen, ""No Country of Old Men"" goes beyond that in its third act to becoming a haunting and unforgettable American classic."
14160	4	a	None of the tales have meat enough to satisfy alone. Together, though, they form a varied backdrop to showcase some respectable character work.
14161	4	a	While Shockproof will inspire more groans than gasps, it's essential viewing for fans of Mr. Fuller and Mr. Sirk.
14162	4	a	Want to know Sedgwick? Listen to Dylan sing 'Just Like a Woman.' That's it -- in less than five minutes.
14163	1	a	More than just laugh-out-loud funny. It's the relationship comedy of the summer and likely the best boy-meets-girl movie of the year.
14164	3	a	Will he break the Internet or will it break him? It's painfully recognizable, this neediness, as is the rise and fall. Ralph, c'est moi.
14165	3	a	A terrific example of artful documentary.
14166	2	a	It's not A Beautiful Mind, and there are some missteps here. But it's an unusually honest movie about homelessness and about newspapers.
14167	2	a	"The film strikes a gentle tone of fish-out-of-water ridiculousness; think ""Jarhead"" meets ""Lost in Translation""."
14168	3	a	This simple but well-constructed comedy picks a situation that naturally causes anxiety - meeting your in-laws - and turns it into a walk through hell.
14169	5	a	The wisecracks and the swaggering are as unrelieved as the film's almost comically ecstatic gunplay. Someone must have figured audiences like things this way.
14170	3	a	"While it openly evokes the spirit of pictures like ""Stand By Me"" and ""Moonrise Kingdom,"" it scores originality points in the shading of its characters."
14171	4	a	It's a little on the lazy side, more content with having fun and dropping names than with actually commenting on anything.
14172	6	a	Though Team America has knee-slapping moments, too much mirth has too little on its mind.
14173	3	a	David Twohy doesn't do much new and the twist is as obvious as a tornado in the Texas Panhandle. But that doesn't make it any less of an escapist joyride on a hot summer day.
14174	5	a	A head-scratching thriller...
14175	1	a	Bravo for the revival of the smart thriller.
14176	2	a	As an audience, we aren't given the tools to equip ourselves to care enough to take anyone's side, and while the performances are good, the story proceeds in a mechanical fashion.
14177	4	a	Genial and potty-mouthed and dumb and sweet -- a rudely engaging road comedy with more inside Star Wars baseball than a convention hall full of Imperial Grand Moffs.
14178	4	a	...essentially worth checking out if only for the performances and Cholodenko's admittedly steady directorial hand.
14179	3	a	At heart this is a film about ghosts - ghosts of dreams and good intentions, ghosts of the boys these men once were - yet you will be hard pushed this year to find a film that has such a lust for life.
14180	6	a	Ronan is excellent and the costumes are lovely, but that's just not enough. You find yourself wanting a whole lot more.
14181	6	a	Most of its supposed observations sound more like touchy-feely mumbo-jumbo than honest, useful information and advice.
14182	9	a	My mother is going to love this movie. 
14183	5	a	Like a politician courting voters, Welcome to Mooseport steers away from anything controversial, content to steer a safe, inoffensive middle-of-the-road comedic course.
14184	3	a	As history 'Selma' may cause some controversy, but as fact-based drama it's exceptionally fine.
14185	2	a	Thanks to some intuitive direction from the filmmakers and a truly inspired performance from Julianne Moore, Still Alice articulates the very specific type of loss that Alzheimer's and other cognitive disorders represent.
14186	5	a	It juggles race track thrills with those in the boudoir, and comes up short in the romance department.
14187	3	a	By the end, a Zen-like calm that might be mistaken for stasis settles over the story. But these lives move forward slowly, inexorably, and they move us, too.
14188	6	a	Okay entertainment for kids but for adults it is all just too familiar. You feel you have seen it all before in better movies.
14189	5	a	From the director of American Beauty comes another empty, fake-meaningful tale of how rotten it is in the suburbs.
14190	4	a	There's a lot of sweetness to Roll Bounce.
14191	5	a	The film like the conceived plot to kill Hitler is commendable for its premise, but is also not well-executed.
14192	5	a	...wants to position itself as a first-date movie, but it's a first-date movie for those who don't believe in second ones.
14193	3	a	Russell's world view is essentially optimistic and romantic
14194	7	a	Even Tigger was unable to add some spring into this film's step. 
14195	3	a	The film wades airily into a cultural no-flyover zone, sits down, and says: OK, let's talk.
14196	4	a	If you thought National Lampoon's Vacation films were at least okay, then Welcome Home Roscoe Jenkins is a decent enough way to spend two hours.
14197	1	a	Much of the credit must go to Jessica Walter for her outstanding performance which somehow manages to be chilling while at the same time sympathetic.
14198	3	a	Director Tom Dey throws in so much energetic slapstick that the film feels lively and fresher than it probably should, especially during several scenes involving animal-induced mayhem.
14199	5	a	Mutant Chronicles has an intriguing premise, good performances and some decent effects, but it's let down by some terrible pacing and an extremely dull script.
14200	1	a	A twisty, tense chiller.
14201	5	a	Inventive and endearing in places but ultimately an unsatisfying mix of slow plotting and superficial characterisation.
14202	3	a	Some of the most convincing and lifelike visual effects in movie history. This is a wide-scope sci-fi thriller done right.
14203	7	a	So limp and mirthless that it would barely pass muster as a single-season network sitcom.
14204	3	a	Robert Pattinson's stare is almost thousand-yard enough to make the film's sense of tragedy feel downright Greek.
14205	5	a	There are some moments when it looks as though it is somehow going to work but then, much like its anti-hero, it comes crashing back to Earth, leaving nothing behind of note besides a giant mess.
14206	3	a	A good scary movie will make you want to cover your eyes, and The Ring succeeds almost too well.
14207	1	a	My face still hurts from laughing.
14208	3	a	It explores the remains of the marathon ship with such intimacy that you expect all the characters in [Titanic's] ethereal final scene to suddenly appear and offer handshakes.
14209	0	a	...even a generous viewer may have to admit that the film runs out of steam before it reaches the finale-a flaw it shares with far too many recent comedies.
14210	2	a	It is the funniest political satire I've seen in a long time. It would have been great if it had anything interesting to say about politics.
14211	5	a	A disappointing excursion into movie history.
14212	3	a	The story of Alan Turing, and his immeasurable contribution to modern society, is superbly adapted for the screen in The Imitation Game.
14213	3	a	Eat Pray Love is ultimately charming and inspirational. Though it doesn't have quite the impact of the book, it will likely leave you pondering your life choices and forgiving your flaws. It will certainly have you forgiving the few flaws in the film. 
14214	3	a	[Director Hall] has proved he is as good with actors as he is at staging action sequences and creating tension.
14215	4	a	There are lots of individual things to like about The To-Do List... but there always seems to be something that derails its momentum.
14216	3	a	The premise is witty.
14217	5	a	What if the movie sucks?
14218	2	a	Hereafter is content to sit back and do nothing - a smart, well directed, well acted nothing.
14219	8	a	Takes us down a rabbit hole and loses us there.
14220	5	a	The movie struggles to find a main attraction that's worth the bullets it's printed on.
14221	3	a	This one tells a hoary tale of Caribbean salvage operators dedicated to hunting sunken treasure on the ocean floor. But the true salvager is the guy behind the camera. John Stockwell has already flashed his talent for rescuing B-material.
14222	0	a	One of the funniest, most joyous comedies to come along since the Greeks invented comedy.
14223	4	a	There's no contrived moralizing bridge to modern relevance, no overt nod to contemporary gender politics and no real reason why Close shouldn't get some respect this awards season.
14224	7	a	Feels like they shot the story treatment without ever bothering to turn it into a screenplay....the film is full of empty patches: not plot-holes exactly, but spots where it seems we aren't getting a full movie.
14225	7	a	As a big-screen vamp on the cable sketch, it plays itself out long before 'The End' crawls into view.
14226	2	a	"It gets overly cute, with a soundtrack featuring pop standards like ""We Are Family"" and ""Celebrate."" Is this the arctic or a middle school party?"
14227	0	a	Episodic but sublime screwball comedy, with Grant and Dunne at their most alluring.
14228	4	a	Overall, the film never quite hints at answers or even much comprehension of the problems, but it should fit the bill for those looking for empathic communion, or those simply wanting to bash men.
14229	7	a	Has anyone other than Paul Walker and Josh Brolin qualified for a SAG card? I pity any audience sitting through these people mouthing the script's bromidic lines.
14230	3	a	Suprisingly no-holds-barred portrait of institutional bullying for such an early film.
14231	3	a	The film version is pure wish-fulfillment fantasy.
14232	10	a	Horrible.
14233	6	a	There isn't much real chemistry between Farrell and Fox, or even Farrel and Li, so we really don't believe much of what's going on.
14234	3	a	Whatever problems some might have with its execution, it's hard to argue against a film whose intent is to kindle youthful compassion for living things and inspire action to protect Earth and its creatures.
14235	3	a	Clint Eastwood's somber meditation on life after death is every bit as ponderous as you'd expect. In the hands of this superlative director, it's also very watchable.
14236	3	a	Land of the Dead is rich with political metaphors and social satire, none of which ever throws us out of the story or slows the breakneck pace.
14237	0	a	A joyful, angry, and sad film - occasionally all three in the same scene.
14238	3	a	The story unfolds slowly, with the filmmaker's own fascination with process at center stage.
14239	2	a	In its abstract, often ephemeral themes and images, it's a film that will probably not find favor with everyone, but...
14240	1	a	A slow roast of a movie that seals in all the flavors.
14241	5	a	Daft, throwaway tosh that doesn't even qualify as a guilty pleasure.
14242	5	a	It's one of those movies best watched on DVD or Blu-ray where you can fast-forward any time you see someone open their mouth to talk.
14243	5	a	The story idea is new and different, and the plot turns are fun and interesting, with that oh-so-tres-French bittersweetness lurking below the surface Auteuil is perfect...
14244	1	a	A blast of piercing social insight expressed through exquisite craftsmanship that makes it feel like art and not bald-faced messaging.
14245	3	a	A fascinating, unflinching and tragic documentary about the chimpanzee we tried to make human.
14246	6	a	Jarmusch missed his mark; trying to present simple, non-dramatic moments but using celebrities
14247	2	a	Morgan Freeman's role in Invictus is a universe away from his role in Lean on Me, even if both characters turn around troubled institutions.
14248	4	a	In the end, the message is what prevails. The movie's political and moral points -- and theme about creating family however you can find it -- elevate it above the average kids movie.
14249	0	a	[Kaurismaki] trusts us to find the humor and the humanity that coexist in his world and in the process retains a purity of style and intent.
14250	3	a	A masterful performance.
14251	4	a	As solid as Cranston, Leguizamo, Kruger, Bratt, and all the rest are, the built-in constraints of the movie format don't do their real-life counterparts full justice.
14252	3	a	After a run of loose, uneven films, Allen hits the right notes in this funny, astute comedy about artistic creation and personal dreams. And Wilson turns out to be one of the best on-screen Allen surrogates in years.
14253	10	a	I was wrong: There are worse things than Mr. Magoo.
14254	3	a	A provocative reflection of its rule-breaking subjects, Brett Morgen's political documentary re-examines the past while drawing unmissable parallels to the present.
14255	6	a	Identity Thief could be mistaken for the latest Todd Phillips comedy. Whether that's an endorsement or a warning depends on your tastes. 
14256	4	a	Funny bits abound, overstuffed to the point of tearing at the seams, the film might have benefited from a bit more cutting. 
14257	4	a	This was the film that helped launch Sophia Loren as an international sex symbol.
14258	1	a	Just a strong recommendation and a big thumbs up for Schrader still having so much to say after a recent string of cinematic misfires. 
14259	3	a	Works very, very nicely.
14260	5	a	Movies of this genre normally want you to root for the couple to end up together. All this one had me doing was hoping that someone would smack them upside the head and talk some sense into them.
14261	1	a	We believe she is a Disney princess. No doubt Giselle will be joining her forebears at the theme parks.
14262	5	a	Vincenzo Natali directs this science fiction thriller with an intriguing premise. Unfortunately, there's little to Cube besides that premise and some creative filmmaking techniques.
14263	4	a	Rock Dog is an easy to indulge in production that is somewhat formulaic, but comforting in its execution.
14264	4	a	The Extra Man is a disappointment coming from Berman and Pulcini, whose American Splendor was an imaginative biopic about the late comic-book author Harvey Pekar.
14265	3	a	Less a romantic comedy than a scathing commentary on the uselessness and inanity of everyone in Hollywood.
14266	4	a	Interesting story -- but been here, seen this.
14267	0	a	One of the best films of the year with its sturdy depiction of the grace that accompanies turning an enemy into a friend.
14268	6	a	It's a would-be prestige picture that aims for something higher and misses.
14269	6	a	With its ungainly double-deception premise, How to Lose a Guy feels like it was made out of two connect-the-dots drawings laid haphazardly on top of one another.
14270	4	a	A certain sexiness underlines even the dullest tangents.
14271	0	a	"Blanchett's a formidable technician, a performer of serious wit and fire. She serves ""Carol"" well and truly throughout."
14272	6	a	Every actor does a good job, but they rely on songs to tell a story instead of the screenplay. And I have no idea why I would root for any of them. 
14273	2	a	A subtly touching religiously oriented saga of compassion, conviction and absolution.
14274	1	a	This is perhaps the most visually stunning Bond movie ever made. 
14275	6	a	For the sheer promise it held for so long, and its jarring plunge into maddening mediocrity by the end credits roll, Matchstick Men may just rank as the most disappointing film of the year.
14276	1	a	Sausage Party is a fun time at the movies, but with its thought-provoking plot and its gloriously excessive attitude towards political incorrectness, it's bound to be elevated to cult status alongside the South Park film and Team America: World Police. 
14277	6	a	There's plenty to admire, but little to care about.
14278	3	a	It's out there but plausible, a logical extension of the steadfast drive toward invasive marketing that's a hallmark of an age in which everything and everyone has a price.
14279	6	a	...a well-acted film that doesn't go particularly anywhere, a film with strong production values whose director appears to lack confidence of vision. It's both overworked and underdone.
14280	3	a	Schrader's best in yonks, a powerful meditation on faith's place in the modern world. Hawke, as a kind of Travis Bickle in a dog collar, gives one of the performances of the year.
14281	10	a	I looked at the ceiling, not casting my eyes heavenward for assistance but trying to find something more interesting to look at than what was on the screen. The ceiling won.
14282	6	a	Think of the uncompromisingly mediocre comedy You, Me and Dupree as a referendum on whether audiences are tiring of Owen Wilson's beatific stoner dude character as rapidly as I am.
14283	2	a	Guy Pearce isn't as physically formidable as Clint Eastwood or Charles Bronson in Leone's classics, but he's just as determined and dangerous.
14284	4	a	Relies heavily on its Rat-Pack-ish ambience and retro style to propel its disjointed storyline steadily forward.
14285	3	a	Theron's endearing rapport with MacFarlane the actor helps smooth over whenever MacFarlane the writer/director goes a little overboard with his penchant for toilet humor.
14286	3	a	This is clearly a film set out to shock, offend and, above all else, make you laugh.
14287	2	a	It is an impressive movie masquerading as an important one.
14288	4	a	It's something of a sweet-natured slog, peppered, as all of Crowe's films are, peppered with the pop music the former pop music journalist loves.
14289	9	a	A cynical, sexist and shallow work from cinema's premier misanthrope, Robert Altman, who here shows neither compassion for -- nor insight into -- the human condition.
14290	9	a	Despite a basic premise that's ripe with promise, the film leaps way over the top with a key performance while also succumbing to some silly cliches.
14291	3	a	Abundantly heartfelt and consistently funny, Love, Simon has a unique place in the canon of LGBTQ cinema, in part for how sweetly ordinary this coming-out story plays out. Oh, and the fact that it's a slick, big studio release.
14292	10	a	In the past, Hannibal Lecter has both frightened and fascinated me. Now he's just a sad shadow of his former cinematic glory, stuck in an unspeakably awful movie.
14293	7	a	there is no urgency, no smoldering passion and no excitement in The Tourist
14294	4	a	There's something dreadfully wrong when the picture shows signs of completely misunderstanding, or choosing to ignore, the dead moral centre of Carver's story. Why, then, bother to adapt it?
14295	6	a	But it's too predictable by half, and Mamet's profundities have more volume than mass.
14296	3	a	Keough is a standout and Craig is a complete hoot. 
14297	5	a	The basic storyline just isn't very good, and any attempt to say anything meaningful or moving is ham-fisted and obvious, which quite simply isn't good enough for a film as in-your-face as this.
14298	9	a	In a way, it's pitiable more than anything.
14299	3	a	Many actors are too cowardly, or too egotistical, to play an unsympathetic character. So Cumberbatch's performance deserves more consideration than many of his peers'.
14300	3	a	It has just enough of those two ingredients that made the first film such a gem: style and soul.
14301	2	a	Christopher Robin bobs along agreeably, a mellow, often melancholy and entirely diverting job of work that keeps the spirit of the characters intact.
14302	4	a	The problematic concept keeps 'Hereafter' earthbound, but the film contains four sequences that affirm Eastwood's mastery, including the opening tsunami, which is not only spectacular but somehow intimate, thanks to the focus on the character of Marie...
14303	3	a	Adams is the wish your heart makes when you want a storybook princess for the ages. She's wicked good.
14304	6	a	It's hard to have any thoughts while watching Jonah Hex -- the cranium-crushing soundtrack takes care of that.
14305	4	a	It's not as good as I hoped, but it's also a lot better than I feared.
14306	0	a	a genuinely wonderful film that, despite its atypical source, finally gives [Patricia Highsmith's] writing its deserved work.
14307	2	a	It is probably worth some time in a movie like this to show that Hitchcock had a life other than just making movies. This movie concentrates more on the man behind the movies than the mechanics of movie-making, and that is a defensible choice.
14308	3	a	"Craig makes her directorial debut with ""The Edge of Seventeen,"" which ranks among the best teen comedies of last two decades. It would feel right at home with a movie marathon of modern classics ""Mean Girls"" and ""Easy A."
14309	4	a	Despite first-class performances - from Cruz, Gomez and Homar - Almodovar's narrative appears laboured, offering none of the surprises that lent vim and vigour to his earlier outings.
14310	6	a	The script is so brain-dead and the characters so one-dimensional that you can't help but wish someone would had taken the plot half as seriously as the pyrotechnics.
14311	4	a	Classic Steve Martin
14312	7	a	It demands love, which is the best way not to get it.
14313	4	a	An overstuffed plot can't deter from the size of this film's heart.
14314	5	a	Love alone does not make a film watchable, no matter how much of it there is. Davies and company are up to the task, but the material is weak. Coppola has a lot of ideas; he just needs to find a more coherent, entertaining way of expressing them.
14315	3	a	Romantic, moving film brings poet -- and poetry -- to life.
14316	4	a	Fitfully amusing but nothing remarkable.
14317	3	a	If you're looking for something to make you feel good about chubby, cherubic Ted, the venerable lion of the Senate, this is not your movie.
14318	7	a	Depp portrays Wilmot, who was also remembered for scandalous poetry and theatrical satire, as a careless and generally unpleasant fellow, who is neither funny nor profound. And we're supposed to spend two hours with this guy. Ugh.
14319	3	a	I connected on an emotional level with it the first time, but I suspect I may find it better on repeat viewings; there is a masterpiece in there somewhere, I just have to dig deeper to find it.
14320	0	a	There is pure expressionist inspiration in Murnau's juxtaposition of the malign wolves and the terrified old women: a poetry of fear.
14321	1	a	The struggles of being a kid are beautifully depicted in the film ... both homage to and a modernization of the traditional high school dramedy where the immediacy of social media can ruin a life.
14322	0	a	Team America: World Police is this decade's Dr. Strangelove.
14323	6	a	Athletic dancing and a patriotic theme make this movie better than it should be.
14324	4	a	Both in film and music, he tantalizes us with autobiographical detail while dazzling us with wit, grit, insight, profane humor and mind-boggling wordplay.
14325	6	a	The movie's moral messages are all on target. Too bad the movie is much, much too long and Jackson gives one of his dullest performances ever.
14326	1	a	A modern epic tragedy, where the weight of everyone's actions are felt from conception to enactment.
14327	6	a	Culkin shows that he might be more than a one-trick pony given a little seasoning. It just might be a good idea if his next trick is something original.
14328	6	a	Gibson has basically taken the greatest story ever told and turned it into a snuff film ... It's Kill Bill for the churchgoing crowd.
14329	3	a	This one is a stunner, sure to send people out into the streets afterwards arguing in love-it-or-hate-it caterwauls bystanders will be able to hear halfway down the street.
14330	4	a	Unsurprising, but chilling, well-played and very well-executed revive-the-dead horror thriller. 
14331	7	a	The plot is a bewildering blunder, expecting you to jump right into it even though you're never sure you understand the story's progression. 
14332	9	a	To say that 'Christopher Robin' is confused is an understatement. 
14333	5	a	It has its moments, but not enough of them.
14334	3	a	The show itself runs a little long for an animated feature but finishes in a flurry of special effects that left me dumbfounded. Don't miss it folks.
14335	1	a	Payne's compassionate, surprisingly upbeat and mordantly comic black-and-white film about a dying way of life and the people still living it has a familiarity bordering on intimacy.
14336	6	a	Like an extraordinary-looking but intellectually limited fashion model.
14337	9	a	The Last Witch Hunter manages to be both overly complicated and painfully predictable at the same time.
14338	3	a	A worthy woman's film and Jolie's best showcase to date.
14339	3	a	Small, vivid moments, squeezed into a small physical and dramatic space, then tightened with a vice of suspense and dread.
14340	9	a	The film's generic nature extends to everything about it: the unengaging cinematography, haphazard editing, emptily jaunty score, even use of locations.
14341	0	a	A delirious triumph: a stylish-squared meeting of creative minds, a swirl of hypnosis and symbiosis, with Pynchon's prose partly assigned to a narrating character and partly diversified into funky dialogue exchanges.
14342	3	a	Part of the kick to Serenity is watching the filmmaker expertly play with moods as he hyphenates the western and sci-fi genres.
14343	4	a	Wonderful baroque production and set design... The timely jump scares and comedic banter between Black and Blanchett also help make the film entertaining enough for young moviegoers.
14344	5	a	Earnest but amateurish.
14345	2	a	A lurid psychological thriller that's sexy, nasty and a lot of fun...And you were expecting subtlety from a film written by Joe Eszterhas and directed by Paul Verhoeven?
14346	1	a	What Zhang Yimou really does best--the epic scale of intimate human emotion.
14347	1	a	"If you're looking for a clockwork-perfect crime plot, you won't find it here. But if you want to hang with some wildly unpredictable and complex characters and wonder who will come up on top, ""Hustle"" is a lot of fun."
14348	4	a	Uncomplicated but unremarkable, Jane won't blow anyone away.
14349	5	a	The Break-Up is being marketed as an 'unconventional romantic comedy,' but the only thing unconventional about it is that it's not romantic and it's not a comedy.
14350	5	a	Don Cheadle stars in Hotel for Dogs. Did he lose some sort of bet to Clooney and Pitt?
14351	3	a	Coppola's lively lark of a movie is as fresh as new-car smell because it's so sharply observed and attentively acted.
14352	1	a	I can't pretend to relate to the troubles of a teenage girl in today's society but The Edge of Seventeen comes across as realistic and authentic.
14353	3	a	Explores the many levels of a friendship between a button-down African-American radio program director and a tell-it-like-it-is deejay who connects with the black community in Washington D.C
14354	5	a	Couples Retreat is a lazy, unimaginative comedy that, with the talent on show, should have been a whole lot more than another boring rom-com to throw on the pile.
14355	9	a	A bunch of bizarre-for-the-sake-of-being-imaginative stuff happens in The Last Witch Hunter, much of it making little sense, and some of it that probably made sense but I hadn't the energy to figure it out.
14356	3	a	Between the many 'What the?' moments until its outrageously absurd ending, Vantage Point is a brisk, entertaining experience.
14357	7	a	Other than being silly most of the time and stupid on occasion, there is nothing offensive about Daddy Day Camp.
14358	3	a	While most of us can't identify with having to change our gender to get by, we can all feel the familiar tug of Albert's fundamental desire, which is nothing more than to fit in and be loved. 
14359	3	a	Well-acted crime drama, though the thick accents might be off-putting to some.
14360	2	a	Brad Bird's richly imagined, retro-moderne homage to the superhero-fueled daydreams of his youth creates a vibrantly original mythology.
14361	6	a	The moral is: Don't get sick and don't get old.
14362	6	a	Not entertaining, but good writing, direction, and the performances are outstanding.
14363	8	a	Never goes deeper than the ink on a comic book
14364	3	a	Stylish, satirical and intriguing, surreptitiously exploring themes of ambition, jealousy and betrayal - and Penelope Cruz dazzles.
14365	5	a	If this soulless slog is any indication of what to expect from future Amblin wannabes, then we're all in trouble, as it isn't Back to the Future as much as it's bleak for the future.
14366	6	a	Skyfall is an awesome James Bond movie until it gets tired of all that, goes a little crazy and turns into a not-so-awesome Home Alone movie. 
14367	3	a	"The urge to revisit old successes in an attempt to ""improve"" upon them is a risky venture at best."
14368	5	a	Suffers a fate similar to that of many other horror and supernatural thrillers released in the last decade: It leaves you with the feeling that you're watching an episode of The X-Files, only Mulder and Scully never show up.
14369	3	a	I just couldn't take my eyes off the screen.
14370	3	a	Those for whom imminent danger, spectacular mayhem and singeing sexual attraction don't go down well can go sip some tea and sit it out on their rocking chair.
14371	2	a	A sincere and perceptive coming-of-age teen film.
14372	9	a	full review at Movies for the Masses
14373	6	a	The characters do not have the brittle edge, the dangerous dynamism they did before. They're just not as interesting.
14374	4	a	Jude Law is perfect for the role in every way, matching Caine's charms note for note, and only besting the maestro with his disarming good looks.
14375	6	a	If this movie were ever to open on Broadway, they could hold the opening and closing night parties simultaneously.
14376	8	a	As much as I adore the Bond franchise, I can't say I've ever been as giddy over one of those films as I am with The Bourne Identity.
14377	3	a	I'm beginning to suspect that writer-producer-actor Seth Rogen is up to foul play.
14378	0	a	Like much of Allen's best work, this is an ensemble film with a terrific supporting cast.
14379	5	a	Silent Hill starts out promisingly -- atmospheric and creepy -- but degenerates into a muddle of nonsensical plotting, dull characters and unintentional hilarity.
14380	0	a	Part homage to the art of performance, part admiration of science and technology, part unexpected turn to science fiction, and total mind-melting madness.
14381	1	a	A very funny heist film.
14382	6	a	Inevitably, the film culminates in a nearly wordless bloodbath with a death every few seconds, plunging onward like the world's longest drum solo.
14383	4	a	It's a much angrier, tougher - and sometimes funnier - film than you might imagine from its cloying opening premise.
14384	5	a	If ever there were a film that aimed for the zeitgeist and missed badly, it's this one.
14385	5	a	Love is a commodity in the world of Letters to Juliet, to be processed and marketed as another studio might a G.I. Joe or a Transformer.
14386	2	a	Once again, a movie withholds vital information in order to pump up its dramatic level in the last act. This device may not be illegitimate, but...
14387	4	a	Its deep knowledge of boxing pictures and sports weepies helps the story glide along. Still, there's a deeper, more powerful tale here that remains frustratingly untapped.
14388	3	a	[Mendes] and screenwriters Neal Purvis, Robert Wade and John Logan have managed what feels like the best possible thing that could have happened to Bond: They've made him fun again.
14389	3	a	Hereafter isn't about the hereafter so much as it is about those who are left here, after.
14390	3	a	The best video-game-based movie so far.
14391	6	a	"Making a ""feather-light"" comedy isn't an excuse for making a bad movie."
14392	0	a	All-star cast in ultimately grim tale.
14393	7	a	No one will be surprised to learn that Jackson's Coach Carter is a shining slab of steel-rod charisma.
14394	7	a	A great big blurry mess.
14395	4	a	With entertainment this cardboard and weightless, isn't a response like disappointment disproportionately complex?
14396	3	a	In this film, basketball is not a metaphor; it's a hard-played game that requires skill, conditioning, intelligence and effective teamwork.
14397	9	a	Clint Eastwood crafts a Babel all his own with Hereafter, a trifurcated tale of death, grief, and the great beyond that finds the director succumbing to eye-rolling corniness. 
14398	5	a	As plastic as the films it attempts to lampoon.
14399	9	a	It's hard to imagine why anyone of any age would find other elements of this movie's attempt at a comic text even mildly amusing.
14400	3	a	A movie puzzle that confounds and then unnerves with an impact as shocking as any of the most infamous of cinema last-reel shockers
14401	0	a	"This is a ""Monster"" of a movie."
14402	8	a	Painful to watch, but it's nothing an aspirin can't fix. Might as well save yourself the headache, though.
14403	3	a	Gia Coppola's film is an interesting, downbeat mood piece that may not climax conventionally, but is still a hypnotic and ambitious meditation on teen life.
14404	2	a	The most interesting part of this movie is its use of broad strokes to mask subtle sketches and careful characterizations.
14405	4	a	Thanks to Vaughn, Favreau, and the stray sharp lines that pop out of everyone else, the film at least offers the lively sound of egos that still know how to swing.
14406	1	a	Like a shot of nitro to the franchise and shows there's plenty left in the tank.
14407	9	a	It's just bad storytelling.
14408	6	a	A film so detached from Asimov's vision, it emerges as a destabilized attempt at reworking an already-polished concept.
14409	0	a	Although Payne has never been a flashy director - he's one of the few modern filmmakers who regularly, publicly puts script and performance first - there are so many lovely, visual moments in this film, shot in wide-screen black-and-white.
14410	3	a	In an entertaining way, the movie says something challenging, that it's possible to lose your life to stuff -- and never even know it.
14411	3	a	For those who surrender to its atmosphere, and appreciate an unconventional cinematic experience, it's extraordinary.
14412	2	a	...it gets an enlivening, high-octane delivery, thanks to Hutton and director George Sidney.
14413	4	a	The movie goes out of its way to be offensive, even by today's standards. The interesting thing is that it does it in an otherwise charming romantic comedy that's actually funny.
14414	3	a	A thoroughly entertaining look at the preparations for Valentino's last haute couture show and how, indeed, he represents the last of an era of highly trained couturiers who are being swallowed up by mergers and acquisitions.
14415	0	a	Laugh hard, laugh long, but just laugh at true greatness.
14416	4	a	...a simple, classic narrative structure. [Full Review in Spanish] 
14417	3	a	The whole Harry Potter thing may not be as fresh for moviegoers as it was last year, but thankfully Chamber of Secrets is well-crafted.
14418	5	a	If the ending does not confuse you, maybe you were just not paying attention.
14419	1	a	[jason] Clarke does wonders with the material, adding new dimensions and layers between what hit the screen and what lingered just out of frame.
14420	1	a	No matter how bizarre or off-putting the film may be at times, it is infinitely more engrossing.
14421	3	a	An unconventional coming-of-age story that's likely to appeal to the rebellious teen in all of us.
14422	5	a	an awesome folly, a misguided project of genuinely enormous proportions that feels like exactly what it is: an impersonal product of franchise-hungry corporate culture
14423	4	a	Tune out the dreck and there are enough laughs for it to be worthwhile.
14424	9	a	...even less intelligent than your average action flick.
14425	3	a	It does have a low-key charm to it that should resonate both with kids and nostalgic adults alike. If nothing else, the goofy-spooky vibe should make it an instant Halloween perennial.
14426	3	a	With warmth and humor, Christopher Robin invites audiences to reunite with their inner child. [Full Review in Spanish]
14427	1	a	The film is fascinating on every level -- as a portrait of a willing servant in a complex, powerful and inscrutable religious system and a feast of spectacular sights and unusual mundane events in a corner of the world rarely exposed to prying eyes.
14428	4	a	If short on surprises, the screenplay has a fair share of snappy patter.
14429	4	a	While the story could use a tighter focus, the ensemble is strong and the music makes Cadillac Records worth catching.
14430	5	a	The final third seems all shot in a strange blue light that makes even the gorgeous Theron look consumptive, and is, in a nutshell, no fun at all. Aren't Fourth of July movies supposed to be fun? No fireworks this time, Will.
14431	2	a	The film is told in bursts of flashback, flash forward and even flash sideways all framed in a dream-world sense. The slow-motion theatrics of skater tricks are particularly beautiful and almost a flight from the reality of the cruel teen years.
14432	2	a	The local diner, pick-up trucks everywhere, beautiful sunsets on a lonely countryside and you sense that if something wasn't done to stir things up, the town and its secrets would slide into nothingness. If only the billboards could speak.
14433	0	a	Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri is a character study, even though the parts never stop moving -- it's wildly violent, brilliantly funny and deeply moving. And so smart.
14434	1	a	Fresh appeals to the head as well as the heart.
14435	1	a	The film is as convincing in its stupidity as it is in its intelligence. That's praise, by the way.
14436	6	a	While The Green Hornet is a passable time killer, cineastes might go into shock that such an unremarkable piece of Hollywood mulch was helmed by French whiz kid Michel Gondry.
14437	3	a	Underneath the wacky Halloween-ready styling of The House with a Clock in Its Walls is an insightful message about how loving others is to accept the pain that may come with that feeling.
14438	4	a	Unashamed of flaunting its B-movie conventions
14439	4	a	More a meditation on the nature of life itself than anything else, and a welcome respite from Robin Williams, the emotion sponge.
14440	0	a	Even the swamps of New Jersey look beautiful.
14441	0	a	Spielberg fashioned an instant classic whose success owes as much to his superb orchestration as to the substantial jolts and knockout performances by Roy Scheider, Robert Shaw and Richard Dreyfuss.
14442	6	a	Depp putters around in one of his wife's old bathrobes, allowing clues to fall out of the pockets like crumpled used tissues, which is exactly what they and the movie most resemble.
14443	9	a	I'm placing all of the blame on the script and filmmaking, but that's because the actors can only do so much with what they're given. 
14444	4	a	Without the humor, the film would have been unwatchably morose.
14445	5	a	"Identity Thief"" tries its best to entertain but half way through it loses its appeal and you'll be ready for the criminal chase to end."
14446	6	a	Handsomely mounted but dramatically leaden.
14447	1	a	Spielberg had paced the film beautifully so that one is always on edge, tensed for those scary moments that turn out to be false alarms, and left somehow totally unprepared for the real shocks.
14448	4	a	For Matt and Trey fans: always mildly amusing, a handful of bend-over, tears in the eyes, howling. S.Park film better. For those who are offended easily, goodness, don't go.
14449	2	a	"In a movie where the film's trailer has spoiled all its best scenes, and the onscreen chemistry between our primary lovebirds is a failed experiment, it's refreshing that ""Hitch"" still provides that rare buoyant romantic lift that the genre promises."
14450	5	a	For the most part, Devil's Due unfolds more like a scripted reality series than a horrifying tale.
14451	4	a	The Soloist is like its two protagonists: It's a little messy and beaten up in spots, but ultimately it's decent and dignified.
14452	9	a	It just lacks coherence, that's all. Oh, and a point. Oh, and any sense of fun. Oh, and a guy who looks like Heath Ledger in Brokeback Mountain -- no, wait, it has that, never mind. 
14453	6	a	By the time the center of gravity shifts to a villain who exploits Luzhin, the pleasure of following this film has turned to impatience.
14454	7	a	There's a sense of overkill-no pun intended-that stops being drive-in fun and becomes exhausting.
14455	1	a	"The rich may be very different than you and me, but you have no idea how different until you see ""Valentino."
14456	8	a	It's entirely possible that Tokyo Story isn't the best movie ever made. But I suspect that it might be the most perfect.
14457	2	a	A nice and blistering portrait of war at its most absurd.
14458	5	a	Mamet's most frustrating movie
14459	3	a	Excellent techno-thriller. Cool gadgets and a great gang of misfit spies.
14460	1	a	A great moviegoing experience that you can almost reach out and touch.
14461	0	a	"Radio Days"" is so ambitious and so audacious that it almost defies description."
14462	0	a	"Hello, My Name Is Doris"" is a film that proves we are never too old to feel young, but disproves that with age comes wisdom - all in a very genuine and humorous way."
14463	3	a	Though these films are trifles, they are at least high quality trifles.
14464	3	a	A charming blend of whimsy and romance, Julian Jarrold's new film is a beauty.
14465	5	a	All the romantic comedy gloss in the world can't save a script as stale as last week's wedding cake.
14466	0	a	Here's a movie filled with drama and excitement, unfolding a plot of brilliant complexity, in which the central character is solemn and silent, saying only what he has to say, revealing himself only strategically.
14467	3	a	This is a film that allows you to discover its intent, style and meaning while denying you anything that can be called immediate gratification.
14468	4	a	At its best, it recaptures the Rings movies' breadth, detail, and staggering sense of beauty.
14469	1	a	In backwards-thinking terms, Malle was the Tarantino of his day, giving French cinema a creative, influential shot in the arm that opened new horizons in directorial thinking.
14470	3	a	a brilliant feat of movie making
14471	6	a	A triptych of tales which argue for a stronger editorial hand and the inherent flaw in such a format - all parts of your omnibus better work, or the failures threaten to pull down the successes. 
14472	10	a	Unintelligible for new viewers, appropriate only for the superfan, and even then, an unsatisfying hit.
14473	4	a	For the holidays it does come packaged very well and kids will love the idea of living in the backyard of a zoo, but for some adults it misses the mark.
14474	0	a	Giving a seriously Marlene-Dietrich-like performance in her first major role, Ni Ni is spellbinding as the hooker with a heart of gold.
14475	5	a	This is cringe-inducing humor at its most wooden.
14476	6	a	Celtic Pride isn't the worst sports comedy ever made, but it certainly could have been better.
14477	5	a	The final twist does more to unravel what's come before than to tie it all together, making what's come before feel like a cosmopolitan goose chase.
14478	2	a	A gripping and penetrating examination of contemporary Brazil.
14479	4	a	Hoffman the director can't compete with Hoffman the film's star. And he can pretty much just stand in wonder at the layers co-star Amy Ryan brings to the party. The woman is a natural wonder.
14480	3	a	This is a movie full of sex jokes, but they don't involve mechanics and fluids so much as the nature of sex and the way it governs young life.
14481	7	a	This kinder and gentler sequel features the main characters from Daddy Day Care but with a different cast.
14482	2	a	Mallrats enlived by Jason Lee's stellar performance.
14483	4	a	"Entrapment"" is an old-style heist picture, aided and abetted by some newfangled technical gadgetry."
14484	8	a	Compare it with the book, and it stinks. Look at the film on its own, and it still stinks.
14485	3	a	Benjamin Button falls short of greatness. But no other film this year has been so open to the possibilities of cinematic storytelling.
14486	2	a	...the movie is more concerned with the characters than with the sport. So it's a movie for anyone to enjoy.
14487	3	a	The movie looks amazing. And for the first hour, when storytelling and special effects bond like lovers, it plays even better.
14488	7	a	A mess of a horror movie that spent several years sitting on a shelf and should have remained there.
14489	4	a	There is no fault in the new stars of the latest John Green book-to-movie adaptation and this teen dramedy is a slight cut above the norm in the genre even if a lot of it doesn't add up. Still, it's got heart and a nice theme about living life to the max.
14490	4	a	Not prime Altman, but weaves an interesting path due to many sub-plots.
14491	4	a	Nolte is impressive, as is Charles Durning as the coach, and Bo Svenson is hilarious as a veritable giant of a player.
14492	3	a	If I had to use just one word to describe Nurse Betty, that word would undoubtedly be...Quirky. And I mean that in a really, really good way.
14493	4	a	A short, sweet movie perfect for the toddlers and not too torturous for adults.
14494	5	a	Will anyone who isn't a Fangoria subscriber be excited that it hasn't gone straight to video?
14495	0	a	"Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri"" is entertaining in a way that's practically unheard of these days."
14496	10	a	Clint Eastwood turns a terrorist attack into a bit of post-hoc reality 'entertainment' with the stunt casting of the actual heroes as themselves in a stilted, tone-deaf piece of Christian-American propaganda.
14497	1	a	An eloquent anti-war testimonial, it paints a bleak picture of how there is no simple answer to deeply-rooted hatred.
14498	1	a	The bubbling strain between the leading men is the kind of intimate, authentic work that feels several steps above movie acting.
14499	0	a	Gorgeous MGM musical with all-time greats Garland and Astaire.
14500	5	a	The filmmakers might have benefited from more sleep before penning the script.
14501	4	a	Beneath the sappy music and formulaic story, the core of the film rang true.
14502	3	a	They should hand out complimentary razor blades at the end of Revolutionary Road. But if anyone can find the refresh button on the exhausted suburban malaise genre, it's Kate Winslet. And she does.
14503	4	a	"Superhero ""bromance"" is funny but overly childish."
14504	4	a	Tragedy requires us to genuinely care about the character and Factory Girl fails in that regard, despite Miller's emphatic performance.
14505	7	a	The line 'This is not an American story, it's an Irish one' means nothing ... it is a story as American as McNuggets -- all extra-crispy coating and no real meat underneath.
14506	4	a	The city looks good enough to dive into. If only the humans in the frame weren't so shallow.
14507	9	a	Desperately unfunny, badly written sequel that's essentially a mish-mash of tired cliches, fart gags and genuinely terrible performances. One to avoid.
14508	4	a	"If you approach Habemus Papam as a light-hearted farce - ""One of Our Popes Is Missing"" - then it will work nicely for you."
14509	4	a	Handles the material competently, but not exceptionally.
14510	3	a	I do just what I want to do/ I want everything and I want you, too/I wish I could explain to you/But the things men without women do/You just don't understand.
14511	4	a	"...like Cruise's performance, an overall restraint keeps the heroic story behind ""Valkyrie"" from soaring as high as it should."
14512	3	a	Easily the most shocking and disturbing movie in the series and if they choose to finally end things here, they would be ending things on a high note.
14513	6	a	Pooh's Heffalump Movie exists to introduce a new character that can be sold as a stuffed animal at Disney Stores.
14514	6	a	We Bought a Zoo'' is a sweet-natured, terribly unthreatening drama about redemption and renewal, and it may matter more to the man who made it than the audiences who see it.
14515	7	a	Few scenes connect as profoundly as director Christian Ditter envisions, rendering the effort heavy with quirk and an abuse of coincidence, and light with urgent matters of the heart.
14516	5	a	As scatter-shot as a double-barreled shotgun packed with rock salt. Come back Lili Von Shtupp.
14517	4	a	The result is a movie that crackles quietly without flaring up into an emotional blaze.
14518	4	a	Simply put, we've seen it all before.
14519	9	a	It's such a soul-sucking, humourless mess of technobabble and gobble-de-gook, I'm pretty sure sitting through it made me a Scientologist or something.
14520	4	a	Director Nicholas Stoller doesn't have any more luck stringing the story together than he did the first time around, but he knows how to get a laugh.
14521	1	a	A sumptuous and saddening feast of noir massaged in minute detail by the master of women in trouble.
14522	1	a	An insightful look into the making of a historic moment; Oyelowo raises the roof as MLK.
14523	3	a	Drawbacks aside, with War of the Worlds, Hollywood is calling on Spielberg to deliver this summer's blockbuster, and he accomplishes the task. The movie is solid all the way around, and Spielberg's touches are everywhere.
14524	4	a	A fairly realistic look at the middle school experience that will have kids cheering while their parents are entertained too.
14525	5	a	The problem here is that the film-makers throw too many elements into the mix. Grand Guignol bloodletting is combined with characters and ideas which often seem to have been borrowed from Rebecca.
14526	10	a	If you pay even a single penny to watch the thing, you'll be making the most ill-advised purchase of your natural born life.
14527	6	a	Among the many movies about the California drug scene and lowlife, youthful wannabe thugs, Alpha Dog is far from the leader of the pack.
14528	2	a	"David O. Russell follows The Fighter and Silver Linings Playbook with the third entry in his ""reinvention"" trilogy, a film which is getting as much gold and silver on the mantelpiece this award season as his previous two, but less deservedly so."
14529	1	a	Skyfall is as satisfying as a great martini.
14530	4	a	[Koepp] manages some compelling creepy-crawly moments and captures the wintry mood of Mr. King's small-town upstate New York setting.
14531	3	a	[It] should have been awarded the Most Valuable Player. It ticks off nearly all the boxes ... However, the tastefully polished production offers few surprises.
14532	3	a	The films have been exhibited over the years at festivals and museums but, viewed together, they cohere surprisingly well.
14533	5	a	Overly crude jokes and gross-out humor drag comedy down.
14534	7	a	This movie isn't about anything. This emperor is wearing no clothes.
14535	5	a	[Serry] wants to blend politics and drama, an admirable ambition. It's too bad that the helping hand he uses to stir his ingredients is also a heavy one.
14536	4	a	A typical trip that resembles The Goonies as much as it does Stevenson's novel
14537	6	a	Apart from reviving the original Massacre's pervasive sense of Nixon-era malaise, it doesn't offer much in the way of satisfying origins.
14538	3	a	A fresh take on the teen rom-com, this film harks back to vintage John Hughes movies with its smart, self-aware characters and realistic situations that are both amusing and thoughtful.
14539	7	a	"Pompous and unwieldy, the film gives new meaning to the term ""excessive"" and would test the patience of even the fondest history buff."
14540	4	a	Strip it of its historical trappings, and Amistad is really just another courtroom drama -- a particularly manipulative one to boot.
14541	3	a	[P.T. Anderson] is a terrific stylist ... and the scattershot pleasures he's peddling in 'Inherent Vice' may well satisfy those who like style more than substance, or maybe who like their style with substances.
14542	0	a	This being LaBute, this is an atypical fairy tale story made even more so through the filter of a decidedly dark lens--and the film would not be quite the subversively funny and all-around memorable entertainment that it is without him.
14543	5	a	Definitely in the guilty pleasure B-movie category, Reign of Fire is so incredibly inane that it is laughingly enjoyable.
14544	5	a	As a lighthouse generally indicates, avoid.
14545	0	a	Reviewing Citizen Kane is like reviewing The Bible or Shakespeare.
14546	0	a	Sean Penn's first masterpiece as a director.
14547	3	a	Entertaining and charming, the film is one of the better, more accurate, 'coming-of-age' films to be released in awhile.
14548	7	a	In the climactic scene, as stadium fireworks spark graphic battlefield memories in our hero's mind, Lee's experimental film is positively transportive. Movies always induce something like a dream state...the effect here is more like a hallucination.
14549	3	a	documents the bass line running under the absurdly politicized, hyper-kinetic boxing match that found Muhammed Ali facing off against then-titan George Forman
14550	5	a	Unless you're a glutton for dystopian teen anguish, I'd skip it.
14551	5	a	Fanboys kind of made me want to stop being one.
14552	4	a	Jean Luc-Godard's third feature fuses trademark stylistic playfulness with a stark portrait of the dehumanising nature of capitalist society.
14553	6	a	Hackman could play his role in his sleep, but Romano is asleep.
14554	4	a	Despite its earnest attempts at power drama, the joy of Talk to Me lies in the comedy and the wild performances.
14555	6	a	Stylish but distressingly generic and not particularly scary.
14556	5	a	Director Jim O'Hanlon gives the well-chosen locations an impressive sheen, but Leon F Butler's contrived script soaks everyone in soap.
14557	5	a	A far-fetched fairy-tale about the freakish birth of an infant who was born as an old man and who ages from birth in reverse.
14558	3	a	What makes most of Knocked Up work is its ability to squeeze big laughs out of real-world situations.
14559	0	a	Charlize Theron gives her finest performance yet in the unlikely role of serial killer Aileen Wuornos in this riveting depiction of the Florida prostitute's decent into madness.
14560	0	a	There's debate, drama, a lot of humour as well as harshness, and original characters that take the story to unexpected places that are not plot twists but seem to arise naturally out of their own complex life.
14561	5	a	This hopeless adaptation of some book you've never heard of breaks new ground in its determination not to surprise. 
14562	2	a	A beautiful-looking film with an ugly little fantasy at its heart.
14563	1	a	STRANGER INSIDE 'Dunye puts into question how issues of race and class have become a caste system for the incarcerated.
14564	3	a	Violent but thrilling first of the Bourne action trilogy.
14565	3	a	We have seen this story in a hundred other movies ... But Eastwood, as the producer, director and star, caresses the material as if he didn't know B movies have gone out of style.
14566	4	a	...the picture is never not engaging, and it certainly has its moments. 
14567	2	a	Smells like teen spirit. Nice moments, along with enough children of the famous to start a football team.
14568	5	a	The Darkest Minds is here in all its painfully derivative glory, with little originality or spark and a cast that just aren't given the goods to work with.
14569	4	a	Cranston changes his character from regular Joe to raging psycho - and you believe it utterly. He's extraordinary. Too bad the movie settles for being same old/same old. 
14570	4	a	Sort of like a twee version of Curb Your Enthusiasm, it's this blurring of fact and fiction that transforms Paper Heart into a rom-com for the cynical reality-TV age, one that smartly uses documentary elements to provide real heart.
14571	3	a	Works as a straight-up detective story, and the acting is often breathtaking.
14572	9	a	Couples is so formulaic, so fake and relentlessly bland, it's hard to care if any of these pairings get a divorce, drown or are eaten by sharks. It has neither the ring of truth nor the fun of fantasy.
14573	1	a	The seamless blending of reality and fiction makes Paper Heart such an intriguing addition to the mockumentary genre, especially in light of all the TV reality dating shows.
14574	4	a	Lee and Kirby built Marvel Comics on the foundation of the FF and it's no stretch to say this franchise could still be going strong a decade later with a better opening act. 
14575	0	a	Wayne and O'Hara create a fine rapport, with good performances that build to a truly satisfying climax.
14576	7	a	This is a movie that meets the minimum running time to be considered a feature film and has no grander ambition than to serve as a sneaky alternative for families when Star Wars is sold out.
14577	4	a	Has the feel of a quickie made-for-TV doc. It's bare bones ... but timely.
14578	0	a	The second Saint Laurent biopic in less than a year, and both films and both leading men are great. Amazing.
14579	9	a	A cheap and charmless kiddie-orientated sci-fi adventure film. Pre-teens deserve better than this.
14580	3	a	[E]nough breathtaking visuals to make you forgive the movie its plot holes and its tendency to lapse into product placement parody. 
14581	5	a	One day Cosmopolis may well have either been completely forgotten - or seen to have been ahead of its time, hugely influential and something of an overlooked classic experiment.
14582	5	a	This is an accomplished film that does not condescend to teenagers.
14583	4	a	Let's be honest, this movie is for the fans.
14584	3	a	If Emile Hirsch is short on charisma, he nonetheless whets our wanderlust--though if you're thinking of trekking to Alaska, go with a commercial tour group.
14585	9	a	Miserable, in every sense of the word.
14586	8	a	Overly schematic and the least effective screen adaptation of a David Mamet play.
14587	1	a	The film goes a layer deeper than most formulaic chick flicks. It dabbles in the sociological aspects of why many present-day adults refuse to leave the nest, as well as the effect on aging parents.
14588	0	a	I love this film.
14589	4	a	A typically erratic effort from Hayao Miyazaki...
14590	6	a	Desperately trying to say something complex, it only manages to look as if it said something that mattered.
14591	4	a	The lean story-telling works well for its taciturn characters and spare settings, presented by cinematographer Amundsen, and well scored with assistance from Mastodon.
14592	2	a	It does a fine job of mixing the violence of the American streets with the Hong Kong fighting style that has made Jet Li famous.
14593	10	a	Unwatchable.
14594	0	a	Remarkably sophisticated, honest, consistently hilarious and very real.
14595	4	a	CQ has a modicum of IQ and a dash of style.
14596	2	a	"If there has ever been a point in human history when the phrase ""asymmetrical prostate"" got a bigger laugh than it does [here], I've never heard of it."
14597	2	a	Credible and compelling acting.
14598	5	a	An over-arching smugness blights this comic investigation into true love.
14599	4	a	Luckily, the action picks up when the dialogue stalls, with startling car crashes, cat-and-mouse games and unexpected gunshots that make for a spellbinding climax.
14600	4	a	We get it Fincher, some day we're all going to be dead. Now what?
14601	3	a	Practically screams out that it wants to be cool, and succeeds most of the time. 
14602	4	a	Sci-fi digimation, whirling round the screen like the furniture in a drunkard's bedroom, whisks up the characters in its tornado.
14603	3	a	The superb Servillo - who, when he doesn't have the look of Dennis Norden, is the spit of a lusty Sid James - is the perfect match for Sorrentino's wry vision ...
14604	4	a	Somewhere within The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford ... there is a brilliant film.
14605	3	a	It stands up with the finest work that Deakins has ever done, which pretty much means that it's as gorgeous as film gets.
14606	5	a	The film tries too hard to be funny and tries too hard to be hip. The end result is a film that's neither.
14607	1	a	Almodovar could've played it entirely for laughs, with a flick of his wrist and a tonal adjustment. It's best he didn't, though. The movie putters near the end, but it's a film lover's delight.
14608	5	a	A rare dud from two-time Oscar-winning director Ang Lee, Billy Lynn's Long Halftime Walk marches in formation but stirs little awe. 
14609	1	a	Orange County flies right by with the blink of an eye--not because it is necessarily too short, but because you are having so much fun that you don't want it to end.
14610	4	a	Director David Michod's follow-up to his acclaimed debut, Animal Kingdom, is effective in an elemental way.
14611	7	a	Did writer-director Paul Weitz think that U.S. audiences would be too dumb to appreciate actual satire?
14612	4	a	With its gorgeous cinematography, costumes and production design, Geisha is a visual feast, but it lacks emotional heft and leaves the viewer strangely unsatisfied.
14613	6	a	In its own morbid little way, this is very much a stand-up-and-cheer -- or shriek, as the case may be -- kind of film.
14614	4	a	Rarely has the horror of the Terror been so graphically and effectively evoked.
14615	4	a	Kontroll can't seem to decide whether it's an oppressive Kafkaesque satire, a dystopian love story, or a hyperkinetic action movie.
14616	3	a	Wright uses what he learned on Scott Pilgrim to further his long-standing ability to craft genre comedies that are adept at both the comedic aspects and capturing the crowd-pleasing conventions of the genre with which the comedy is combined.
14617	3	a	It's a buoyant comedy with more warmth and generosity of spirit than anything else in theaters right now.
14618	3	a	...as a piece of pure escapist entertainment, you'd be hard-pressed to find a more enjoyable way to spend two hours.
14619	9	a	A bad superhero comedy that takes its time going nowhere.
14620	5	a	The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford is a gorgeous snooze.
14621	4	a	Pick it up for Ben Stiller's sake--a great first dramatic role.
14622	3	a	Fans will freak and the curious will be rewarded by indie film legend Jarmusch's doc of Neil Young and Crazy Horse.
14623	3	a	For every boy who played with dolls or performed an activity once thought 'girly;' for every girl who played sports or was considered a 'Tom boy...'
14624	6	a	The film has too many characters, too much sentiment and too much time-wasting side material and phony-baloney 'motivation,' when the only thing it needs is to let McCarthy do her thing. 
14625	8	a	Not bad so much as inexplicable. You watch in puzzlement.
14626	2	a	While the film is the first of the genuinely bloated Bond movies, it only rarely drags.
14627	3	a	Peckinpah's treatise on violence and masculinity is disturbing on a fundamental level... and equally difficult to forget.
14628	3	a	By far the best feature film in which Tina Fey has played the lead.
14629	0	a	Seeing it a second time has made me love it even more, not always the case.
14630	2	a	Achieves a number of cheap thrills at the expense of the mechanical shark.
14631	5	a	None of it makes much sense, the characters are largely annoying and the underground Martian city is drab and uninviting.
14632	2	a	Stylized like a Ken Burns documentary.
14633	9	a	One regards Reign of Fire with awe. What a vast enterprise has been marshaled in the service of such a minute idea.
14634	6	a	"I suppose it's possible to argue that The Darkest Minds can be enjoyed for what it is. Unfortunately, that ""what"" refers to something incomplete."
14635	8	a	What should have been, could have been. It sure isn't this Green Slacker.
14636	3	a	The movie's strength is not in its story but in its unsettling and weirdly effective visual and sound style.
14637	0	a	Brilliant romantic comedy from Leo McCarey
14638	6	a	The chaotic onslaught of gruesomely violent and graphically sexual exploitation is so ugly and ceaseless this time that it eventually numbs, and then bores, the viewer.
14639	6	a	Sausage Party, for better or worse, is a movie that actually exists. And, at some point along the way, that fact will actually shock you.
14640	9	a	Interesting only in how precious little rationality it features.
14641	5	a	Convincingly pointless and breezy in its hedonistic hokum...Hence, the third time around is not the charm for this foolish and faceless fright flick.
14642	5	a	The new Phoenix lacks the tension, the grim, sado-masochistic Darwinism of the original or the agonizing nuts-and-bolts of the ordeal.
14643	3	a	The film is beautifully shot and framed, and the story it tells is universal and immensely appealing.
14644	6	a	There are some funny and charming lines, but the film is overlong and it rambles a bit.
14645	4	a	Had the old black man and the young white chick gotten it on, I think some audiences might have exploded. Perhaps sensing this, Black Snake Moan backs off, giving us a neat and clean Hallmark card ending.
14646	2	a	the filmmakers may be hedging too many bets, trying to make the film both acceptable to fans and accessible to newcomers. But while SILENT HILL is far from perfect, it is at the very least a valiant effort
14647	4	a	as daring and audacious as its eponymous hero, venturing into realms of mythos and sentiment with equal dexterity and erudition
14648	4	a	This is not the laugh riot that you might expect. Same goes for the fighting. There's certainly a lot less here than in the average Jackie Chan movie.
14649	2	a	First time feature film director Joshua Z. Weinstein uses his documentary skills to put us in the midst of Menashe's life.
14650	4	a	The best description of the film would be Italians busting each other's balls for two hours-and that goes for the ladies, too.
14651	6	a	Two extraordinary performances can't prevent Factory Girl from being an ordinary movie.
14652	4	a	A movie that crams in so many faces, chronological details and endlessly ham-handed stretches of dialogue that the impact of the legitimately moving segments is considerably diminished.
14653	3	a	Warm and a little syrupy like old school films.
14654	5	a	We have another durable candidate for a slew of Razzie Awards... Vaughn plays the same persona in every movie. He has a blustery, cocksure swagger on the outside while hiding his deep-seated insecurities.
14655	6	a	Occasionally, though not frequently enough, something awesome happens.
14656	5	a	Walker is by far the movie's biggest liability, a walking vacuum in the time-space continuum with a terrifying ability to commit heinous crimes against cinema dialogue.
14657	0	a	A gloriously colorful confection of music, theater and emotion.
14658	4	a	As a tribute, the film is very tender. As a biography, it might have benefited from a more objective point of view.
14659	4	a	The film offers an assured lead performance from Steinfeld, some humorous insights into adolescent angst and a curious lack of narrative urgency.
14660	4	a	Mars Needs Moms isn't as bad as you've heard, nor is it as good as it could have been. Will it entertain your family? That depends on how much your kids like mo-cap technology, and how much attention they pay to the inner logic of a film.
14661	6	a	Just feels like The Rock marking time and paying more dues until the more interesting and challenging offers come his way.
14662	3	a	You can feel tickled into a Finnish shade of pink.
14663	3	a	Funny, inventive, surprisingly affecting and packed full of delightful touches, this is family entertainment of the highest order and definitely worth catching in this format.
14664	5	a	Rinky-dink production values, and sheer mindlessness and creative bankruptcy.
14665	7	a	It might be best to discreetly misplace your invitation to these strained festivities.
14666	2	a	Refreshingly loopy, as only Nic Cage can loop.
14667	5	a	This isn't for the mainstream at all. Instead, Inherent Vice is for the die-hard P.T. Anderson fan, the kind of fan that studies every frame of his films.
14668	5	a	Notably only for a first act that credibly depicts a four-way relationship among friends and lovers without tilting embarrassingly toward titillation and/or soap opera.
14669	6	a	Asking Juliet Capulet for relationship advice is a little bit like asking John McCain for campaign consulting, isn't it?
14670	2	a	It's not deep, and it's far from original, but Hughes' word processor apparently still had a little magic left in it.
14671	6	a	The entire third act is an exercise in manic, flashbacky histrionics -- but Zahn and Olyphant's mismatched machismo and the bizarre mystery at the heart of the story do score high marks for exceptional and thoroughly engrossing weirdness.
14672	3	a	It is enthralling and evocative, despite some flaws.
14673	3	a	...an extraordinarily high tension tale...Even better is that the bittersweet conclusion is far from being a typical Hollywood Ending.
14674	3	a	This slow-burning film about surveillance asks moral questions regarding how long we must contain our racial and prejudicial impulses before acting on our suspicions.
14675	3	a	The film's old-fashioned emotional surge accentuates the absurdity of it taking half a century for Hollywood to properly address Martin Luther King's legacy.
14676	4	a	"Marty"" remade by Jim Jarmusch, ""Jack Goes Boating"" is a long dip in a pool of New York working-class-romantic angst."
14677	9	a	You wonder if the filmmakers intended you to utterly despise everyone in the story. Probably not.
14678	1	a	Turturro, by conveying his character's painful, ecstatic inwardness, creates a bond of sympathy with the audience.
14679	6	a	Unless you've got a burning desire to see some old-timers trying to turn back the clocks and running around in a film they know in their heart-of-hearts is more at home on the small screen, wait for the DVD.
14680	5	a	Unfortunately, this dull and listless movie fails to live up to expectations and will be competing for Razzies rather than Academy Awards as one of the worst movies of the year.
14681	1	a	After all the observations on heartache, politics, art, commerce, passion, identity, mortality, even mental health, six hours begin to seem downright compact.
14682	2	a	The Predator... is an ode to the success of that first movie, to making movies simply because one can, not because one should.
14683	4	a	Good-looking but hollow.
14684	3	a	Inspirational, entertaining and gripping.
14685	0	a	Hoffman shines in a role that demands not showmanship, but a kind of complexity and contradiction that can be rendered only through the kind of dull character details that he excelled in, accumulating them from the inside out.
14686	3	a	Menashe is a quiet triumph, pulling back when other films would go too far, delivering an engaging drama of intimate detail and considerable humanity.
14687	1	a	[Crowe's] commanding performance not only towers over Ridley Scott's epic adventure, but elevates it to a higher plane.
14688	7	a	Not a very pretty sight, and certainly not an enlightening one.
14689	3	a	One-of-a-kind high school comedy for the family.
14690	4	a	Revolutionary Road isn't emotionally engaging or moving.
14691	3	a	Something about its portrait of the battle between men and women rings familiar and true, and it has a sweetness and innocence that elevates the best of the genre.
14692	2	a	A mess? You bet, but one that's not without its pleasures.
14693	4	a	Its stars, Jason Bateman and Melissa McCarthy, steal so many laughs from such improbable places that the bumps in this revenge/road trip farce can be mostly forgiven, though not forgotten.
14694	2	a	In Still Alice, Julianne Moore delivers a heartbreaking, emotionally astute portrayal of a woman disappearing in full view of her nearest and dearest.
14695	7	a	Presumably the aim was to meld dark humor with passionate ardor and high drama, but the tone here is lumpy, crass and overheated.
14696	3	a	A female buddy film with bite.
14697	4	a	Bolt is perfectly amiable but rarely brisk, with neither its premise nor its execution quite inspired enough to elicit more than faint admiration.
14698	10	a	A celluloid chlamydeous test and a complete waste of precious life.
14699	6	a	Maturity obviously is not required to make or see these movies, but would anyone really admit to laughing at a turkey biting a man's penis?
14700	9	a	If it does anything at all, National Security should demonstrate the diminishing returns of Lawrence trying to outswagger, outsass and outshoot Eddie Murphy.
14701	1	a	Alpha Dog operates without outrage -- not because the behavior of the people in the movie isn't horrifying but because the movie knows it is much too late to save those bouncing, happy kids we glimpsed in the opening seconds.
14702	6	a	"Afraid of the dullness of its subject matter, and of being lost in the swarm of patronizing eco-documentaries, Carbon Nation tries really hard to speak to the language of ""young people these days."" "
14703	5	a	The idea that there are moral laws at work in the universe exceeding our man-made attempts at justice is a great one, worthy of a great film. One day, hopefully, Michod will make it.
14704	1	a	Tamara Jenkins's The Savages is a beautifully nuanced tragicomedy about two floundering souls.
14705	4	a	The result is more than usually frightening.
14706	3	a	A fascinating, colourful, sometimes outrageous film that succeeds because it was built on a solid foundation.
14707	5	a	With uninspired fight choreography and sequences so dimly lit the viewer has a hard time deciphering where and what anything is, director Bartkowiak reveals he's no Ridley Scott when it comes to tension and buildup.
14708	9	a	Severely lacking in drama, characters and substance.
14709	4	a	Girls Trip's overriding focus is that of friendship -- in its all its raw, bawdy, compromised glory.
14710	2	a	Ostensibly a courtroom drama, Black or White is actually one of the most sensitive and intelligent introspections of American race relations in quite some time. 
14711	6	a	There isn't nearly enough time devoted to the relationships among the men at the beginning, which undermines what happens to them all later on.
14712	3	a	"Love, Simon"" never feels like it exists merely because it should; its endearing charm makes it a film that viewers will watch regardless of its valuable social impact."
14713	9	a	Unless you have an affection for scrawny, slobbery face-licking films with no bite or bark, don't even think about it.
14714	5	a	I found it easy to root for the werewolves over the derelicts, millionaires, and arrogant police who were victimized.
14715	7	a	Viewers know the gotcha is coming not only because they've been groomed to expect a third-act left turn in movies like this, but because the film's characters won't stop talking about it.
14716	2	a	Damon captures the sense of a good man awakening from a nightmare that turns out to have been his actual life.
14717	10	a	...interminable...
14718	1	a	This is Jack at his best, the kind of role that makes him a star. He gets to bear his teeth, take control of a room, and be devilishly cuddly at the same time.
14719	2	a	Those who adore the books may bemoan the flat emotional landscape of the films, which are less easy to engage with. Fans of the first film will be suitably entertained.
14720	6	a	Must Love Dogs is like a puppy with big brown eyes and a wagging tail who weeps with eagerness to lick your hand, but you take a look around the pound and decide to adopt the sad-eyed beagle who looks as if she has seen a thing or two.
14721	3	a	Not a film for cynics, but a creation of shining optimism...Earnest and utterly charming, handed spark and pace by Hanks. It's a treat to have him directing movies again.
14722	1	a	Selma is the kind of expert filmmaking that's long been absent from an American tradition of historical reenactment-it manages the forgotten art of depicting the graceful human beings that made it history in the first place.
14723	5	a	Decked out in snazzy computer-generated animation, but comes across as more rote than exhilarating.
14724	4	a	There are some fantastic sights in John Carter, but there's also a lot of overkill, with Stanton and crew often cluttering up the visuals with the deranged frenzy of George Lucas retooling his Star Wars sagas.
14725	1	a	A wonderfully drawn and utterly charming portrait of dysfunction that doubles as a curious love letter to the American family.
14726	2	a	You may not believe a minute of it, though you won't forget Nelson's face.
14727	4	a	There's nothing like a well-placed nod to the classics to help elevate a dumb summer comedy.
14728	6	a	Wildly uneven romantic drama.
14729	4	a	Terrific supporting cast with eccentric characters lifts this comedy above the norm; Vaughn's rapid fire delivery of witty stream-of-consciousness dialogue really scores.
14730	1	a	A promising start. 
14731	3	a	[A] joyous claymation comedy ...
14732	4	a	Jarrold struggles to sweep things along with quite enough vigour - budget constraints crowd the edge of the frame - but Gadon is intoxicating as Elizabeth. A star is born.
14733	2	a	Even though some of its special effects are now dated, Santa Claus: The Movie is a touching tale that deserves to be rediscovered by younger generations.
14734	1	a	A treasure.
14735	3	a	This is B-movie material all the way, yet it's not only watchable, it's engrossing. That's because the material is in the hands of an A-talent director, who knows, as few of his contemporaries do, how to manipulate the plastic qualities of a film.
14736	3	a	A lovely, loopy modern-day 'Brief Encounter' that has the wisdom not to push too hard or linger too long.
14737	1	a	A visual stunner.
14738	9	a	In the search for gags involving inappropriate contact between adults and a supposed child, the film doesn't overlook an orifice or an excretion.
14739	6	a	When you wrap a movie around a gimmick, the wrapping better be taut and engaging or the gimmick falls flat.
14740	0	a	The film is defiantly short on structure, but the beautiful chaos is so chaotically beautiful that only the surliest viewer will think to complain.
14741	1	a	A joy to watch and will have you beaming by the conclusion.
14742	1	a	It Comes at Night is very close to a masterpiece. Enveloped in dread and oozing with tension, it's one of the great recent studies of the fear that comes from a desire for survival. 
14743	4	a	How often do you come across a soothing, unassuming film as gentle as this?
14744	6	a	It offers a good amount of crowd-pleasing action, but the story is convoluted and the heroes are scowling mannequins.
14745	0	a	It's all about a mood, a feeling that leaves you aching to knead the unspoken into a satisfying loaf of thought, but sits unleavened like a cold lump of dough at the bottom of your gut...Carol is a masterpiece, a shining reflection of what movies do well.
14746	5	a	Comes to life only when the characters are roller skating, which is not often enough.
14747	2	a	This lively animated adventure keeps us entertained even if the story and characters aren't particularly well-developed
14748	3	a	A delightful coming-of-age story which helps prove that lonely teens can indeed be reached by the right adults.
14749	3	a	Poignant coming-of-age drama focusing on a young adult woman.
14750	6	a	Dragon Tattoo offers a handsome package built on rickety foundations, hoping to pass inspection on good looks alone.
14751	3	a	The most inventive, humane comedy in ages, probably the best-directed action film of the summer, and easily the most intelligent science-fiction story in a year lousy with the things.
14752	3	a	Where McCanlies eventually almost succeeds in demolishing his laid-back little embassy of wonder and good will is his refusal to practice what his characters preach.
14753	4	a	Mostly amusing and good-natured, occasionally hysterical, and actually manages to sneak in a subtle lesson about nature.
14754	3	a	... fairly bulges with quirky hangdog charm ... 
14755	10	a	This is quite possibly the worst documentary I have ever had the displeasure of watching on the big screen.
14756	4	a	Astro Boy alternately soars and sputters through a story line that's not quite sure who it's aimed at.
14757	9	a	From poor conception through to shoddy delivery, Devil's Due is a tedious and wholly derivative horror experience.
14758	4	a	Dark subject matter, but Goran Dukic's film is whimsical and determinedly optimistic about life.
14759	2	a	A very serviceable and stylish thriller and more than justifies its bloated running time with some top-notch performances that should keep even the most ardent of Narcos/Breaking Bad fans muy contento.
14760	3	a	The cast is spectacular: Roberts looks relaxed, luminous and credible, Javier Bardem is suitably rugged as her new lover, while Richard Jenkins is brilliant as her grumbling prayer pal.
14761	4	a	Another piercing performance from [Frances] McDormand. 
14762	0	a	Director Alexander Payne, working from Bob Nelson's economical script, and employing Phedon Papamichael's stunningly bleak black-and-white cinematography to great effect, produces a slice of gritty, uncompromising but also deeply human satire.
14763	6	a	A bloated, tedious, uninspired, sluggish and vapid bore that can only be enjoyed by very shallow, unctuous philistines.
14764	4	a	Damon, thank the family-friendly-movie gods, really knows how to hold his head above the corn.
14765	3	a	A sobering and serious Australian movie that touches the deep places in us that are haunted and colored by love, loss, community, and grief.
14766	4	a	The story of how a self-absorbed Korean film director spreads chaos and disappointment into the lives of two women he seduces and abandons.
14767	3	a	It's a Dead Man's Party in Santa's Village ... clever and infectious
14768	1	a	I this movie has some of the most powerful moments I've seen I think all year.
14769	5	a	Christopher Robin shows it's not easy to update a classic. In this case, doing nothing would have been the best thing to do.
14770	3	a	Law is a talented actor trapped in a male model body. He makes us care about this cad we shouldn't give a flip about through his ability to charm and disarm.
14771	6	a	Chinese ballet star Li Cunxin meets girl and America and falls in love 
14772	5	a	Less a movie than a montage, the swinging sixties shot in an arc both tiny and trite.
14773	5	a	Not much worth seeing in this mess of a movie.
14774	1	a	"The French Lieutenant's Woman"" is a beautiful film to look at, and remarkably well-acted."
14775	1	a	Logan Lucky has the briskness and sheen of a professional, a man who, after years of restlessness, has become comfortable enough to simply tell a story with confidence, clarity and gusto.
14776	4	a	Worth seeing for the superb performances from its two leads.
14777	10	a	Identity Thief starts off moronic and then goes downhill.
14778	3	a	"In someone else's hands, ""Crimson Peak"" might have come off as a costume drama shot out of a cannon, but del Toro's is, crucially, a costume drama shot by a cannon."
14779	5	a	Should just count ourselves lucky that the final reunion on a bridge doesn't involve Benjamin on horseback and Paul Young on the soundtrack.
14780	5	a	Schrader privileges theological debate over shocks and was neither the ideal director for a franchise horror film nor as incomprehensible a choice as some suggested.
14781	5	a	In what civilization is this kind of behavior romantic?
14782	6	a	War of the Worlds is a big, clunky movie containing some sensational sights but lacking the zest and joyous energy we expect from Steven Spielberg.
14783	4	a	As the genre goes, it can be entertaining, but The Bourne Identity as a whole can't live up to the sum of its parts or its very weak ending.
14784	4	a	Nick Park's talents often serve only to highlight the fundamental lack of inspiration at Early Man's core.
14785	6	a	"There's nothing surprising about ""Think Like a Man Too,"" but that predictability may well ensure its success with the audience that made the original such a huge hit."
14786	4	a	If you didn't see the ending coming a mile away, then I'd like you to send me your bank account number and access codes so that I can deposit a special prize into your account
14787	4	a	That pain in your neck is cinematic whiplash.
14788	10	a	What's so funny?
14789	6	a	Unlike most recent comic-book adaptations, Fantastic Four doesn't think it's about anything. In fact, it's doubtful that the film thinks, period. 
14790	9	a	Richard Jefferies' script groans under the weight of ridiculous situations and atrocious dialogue.
14791	6	a	Loses steam early on as the result of a jumping bean plot.
14792	4	a	It is entertaining enough, yet it seems awkward and stilted at times. Other times, it is totally loopy.
14793	4	a	Eye-rattling visual chaos that many moviegoers will want to rate X, for Excedrin.
14794	3	a	A breezy satire on consumerism that takes a smart idea and develops it into an entertaining morality tale.
14795	5	a	The scariest thing about this festival of loose ends is the thought of just how much must have gotten lost in the translation.
14796	5	a	It's a disturbingly conventional and painfully cliched bore that doesn't violate any existing cinematic rules, except maybe that romantic comedies are supposed to be funny.
14797	4	a	...visually dull and intriguing in only the most generic sense, but still a showcase for the twin talents of Saoirse Ronan and Margot Robbie.
14798	3	a	Not since Rocky brought Silvester Stallone to virtually instant stardom has there been a more effective attempt to repeat the phenomenon.
14799	2	a	Phil Alden Robinson's film starts as a caustic comedy, and becomes a teary, life-affirming, and sentimental journey of a dying dad.
14800	2	a	Retains a real sense of power. Its message never wavers, always visible beneath the gore.
14801	5	a	Meet the Fockers is as tacky as its title, as crass as a kid learning his first cuss word.
14802	3	a	Veteran star Chan, who plays it mostly straight, has great bromantic chemistry with Cusack, surprisingly convincing as an ancient Roman warrior trying to protect a child of noble birth.
14803	4	a	Steven Soderbergh ... is a steady hand when it comes to these convoluted crime capers and this pleasingly unspools to reveal a plot within a plot.
14804	4	a	At some point, irreverence and wit notwithstanding, enough is enough.
14805	4	a	Compared to some of this summer's blockbusters ... this is better than average.
14806	2	a	...Clearly displays the workmanlike instincts of its creative team, instincts which neither inspire greatness nor fail altogether.
14807	5	a	"Chappaquiddick"" is reminder that while Camelot had its fair share of tragedy, none of the Kennedys were angels - but we already knew that, right?"
14808	9	a	Needless to say, logic takes a holiday, just not in the Bahamas. [Blu-ray]
14809	5	a	Lazy would-be horror film.
14810	6	a	An already thin story boils down to surviving invaders seeking an existent anti-virus. If only there were one for this kind of movie.
14811	3	a	It's Hopkins' impersonation of the larger-than-life title figure that holds the movie together. 
14812	4	a	Kate Hudson looks great in a swimsuit and heels...is that enough to recommend theater viewing? Not really.
14813	2	a	"Teenage boys get their shape-shifting robots, angry cars, and space wars, so if the Bellas want to sing ""Oops I Did It Again"" on a rocket, let them have it."
14814	4	a	Two previously boring actors [Hartnett and Sossamon] ... bring their characters to sparkly life.
14815	1	a	This is still a slick, gripping thriller and Fincher's stylish fingerprints can be seen all the way through.
14816	3	a	Keeps you guessing throughout, a very well written piece and yet another Oscar contender.
14817	5	a	Even in the world of the digitally perfect, a black man seems doomed to be a disposable sidekick, and the heroine must represent every feminist ideal at once.
14818	0	a	Saturated with poetic languor and a deeply sophisticated sensuality.
14819	0	a	Beginning like the classic animated stories, with a beautiful princess being rescued by a handsome prince, it raises a laugh immediately with a brilliant send-up of the saccharin duets the young lovers usually sing.
14820	3	a	An engaging spin on the reliable crime subgenre of lovable thieves.
14821	5	a	"If the film is made with the understanding that campiness needs to be straight-faced to be funny, then are its ""unintentional"" laughs really that unintentional?"
14822	4	a	For the filmmakers, there are simplifications that must have been inevitable, for dramatic and narrative purposes, when it comes to depicting the years of wartime work. But what of the other choices that have been made?
14823	10	a	If exposure to cosmic rays made all women look like Jessica Alba, then every Lifetime movie should glow green. 
14824	8	a	The film winds up as a cutesy vanity project, though it makes none of the participants look good.
14825	5	a	Bobby Jones deserves a better movie than this one.
14826	2	a	"The Miracle Season"" is an inspiring family film but there is no draw except word of mouth. If those entertained spread the word then this little film could find its audience."
14827	6	a	It's a grueling movie, and a thin one.
14828	8	a	This swan song is in serious need of some Auto-Tune.
14829	0	a	A special film with a rich sense of character, developing the director's fascination with average people taking unexpected chances with their routine lives.
14830	6	a	After meandering around for more than an hour, the film snaps electrically into focus for the pivotal scene
14831	0	a	perhaps Streisand's finest hour, on all fronts
14832	4	a	When everything starts being explained, the mystery evaporates and the world of the game loses its eerie bafflement.
14833	8	a	It's a pity the creatures don't eat the cast up faster
14834	2	a	Kudos to the casting director and Winslet's Aussie accent.
14835	2	a	It delivers on every level fans have been hoping. It may even be better than its sometimes problematic source material.
14836	6	a	Some day, Sandra Bullock and Hugh Grant will make a perfectly charming romantic comedy together. Until then, we have Two Weeks Notice, to remind us that bad things can happen to good ideas.
14837	0	a	A Robert Altman masterpiece that weaves together the lives of Sothern California denizens together around an earthquake.
14838	4	a	Charlize Theron turns a Monster into a human being.
14839	5	a	A shallow, confusing and vexing film.
14840	5	a	Even though it is relentlessly intense, at times even deeply moving, The Passion ultimately leaves you numb.
14841	6	a	Bonello tries to demistify it's subject but sometimes it feels like the character overcomes his vision. [Full review in Spanish]
14842	3	a	In this, the fourth instalment in the series from the original team, you have a classic Bond film that wants for nothing but a trim.
14843	0	a	"Knocked Up"" has an elegance of form, a generosity of spirit and a mad determination to take things too far - and then farther -that approaches comic perfection. And in the end achieves it."
14844	1	a	The mood is darker and quieter than the Coens usually present, though some of the dialogue has a deadpan humor.
14845	6	a	Despite a great ensemble of actors, it will leave you hanging from a cliff.
14846	2	a	In a major coup, director Amy Berg convinced O'Grady to appear in [Deliver Us From Evil], and his testimony reveals a man who's chillingly divorced from the full weight of his actions.
14847	3	a	This sad, informative film is a high-quality documentary and another feather in the cap of James Marsh.
14848	5	a	Never binds into a satisfying whole.
14849	4	a	This road movie heads in predictable directions but with unpredictable results.
14850	4	a	A stellar cast.
14851	6	a	Like a made-for-TV holiday special, it's a hug from a stranger instead of a memorable night with the family.
14852	1	a	The decisions the characters make throughout the film are deeply rooted in who they are, not strictly because this disease forces them to make that choice, and that makes It Comes At Night an all-consuming and deeply disturbing film.
14853	5	a	This film is more like a limousine than a Cadillac - it is very long and carries far too many people.
14854	9	a	Ten years in the making, and this is all we get?
14855	3	a	Rosamund Pike has given the performance of a lifetime in the film.
14856	1	a	"Ralph Breaks the Internet"" is giddily of its moment, a colorfully wacky satire of web culture that doesn't care whether it's still relevant in five years or five days."
14857	3	a	Profoundly eloquent and empathetic, elevated by Julianne Moore's restained, delicately nuanced performance.
14858	6	a	The film is on far less ground when it eventually becomes yet another wartime domestic tale, with Maybury's semi-kicky style draining out slowly until mediocrity settles in.
14859	5	a	The movie isn't just mediocre -- it's profoundly mediocre.
14860	3	a	It succeeds because Allen's muse is completely activated, unlike last year's time-waster You Will Meet a Tall Dark Stranger, in which thought ran no deeper than the title joke.
14861	2	a	Blanchett is good to watch as the dignified witch.
14862	5	a	Revolutionary Road isn't just a failed literary adaptation. It's a failure of the worst kind: It doesn't even make you want to read Richard Yates' deservedly legendary book.
14863	0	a	Underrated at the time of its release, this majestically paced western is one of the finest achievements of the genre and stands as a career-best for many of its participants.
14864	3	a	A kicky mix of space-movie mayhem and cowboy-movie corn.
14865	0	a	constantly bursts with life and meaning, despite the fact that very little happens in the conventional narrative sense
14866	3	a	[Director] Lawrence's compelling little film pursues a deep question: why people make the choices that they do - and how they then live with those decisions, right or wrong, weak or strong.
14867	3	a	...delightfully surprising freshness and soul where all the hackneyed conventions usually are.
14868	4	a	So, you know, it's fine. It's nothing special.
14869	4	a	Adults will see the huge plot holes that pepper Hotel for Dogs but the filmmakers know that the real audience, the youngsters, won't care.
14870	5	a	Lawrence and Christian have the luxury of more time to explore [the story], but instead they merely add several external, superficial elements that misunderstand and circumvent the story's center.
14871	3	a	Cage's increasingly crazed and manic performance is very watchable.
14872	2	a	There is a world of possible interpretation lurking beneath the surface of Frank Cottrell Boyce's script, which is as disorientating as the scenario the characters find themselves in.
14873	6	a	Does have its share of very powerful moments, and it boasts some strong performances. Whether audience members will be able to concentrate on them amid the ultra-realistic and excruciating violence, however, is questionable.
14874	0	a	A masterpiece.
14875	4	a	Doug Liman has come up with a really fun piece of eye candy and that's as much as one should hope for in a summer shoot'em'up.
14876	6	a	As lovely as the elegiac music and breathtaking shots of the Tibetan countryside are in Unmistaken Child, they don't really move things along.
14877	3	a	Broken Embraces is a riddle, wrapped in a mystery, inside a slightly overindulgent parade of gushing film references.
14878	3	a	"At nearly three hours long, ""An Unexpected Journey"" has moments when the caravan seems both overstuffed and out of balance, but it's such a scenic trip that only a stubborn homebody could complain."
14879	4	a	Gateway horror full of punchy repartee and an empathetic soul. The blending of the spooky and sweet is infectious.
14880	9	a	If you like watching men with no necks thumping each other, this could be your Citizen Kane.
14881	3	a	It's a no-nonsense crime procedural that suits its hero.
14882	5	a	"Westfeldt tries with all her might to ensure that the film is socially and romantically ""edgy"" by ridiculing anything that might smack of old-fashioned, middle American morality and dowsing us with the characters' unquestioned narcissism"
14883	3	a	Won't be for everyone, but if nothing else, you'll never look at your groceries the same way again.
14884	5	a	Frankly, it's painful to watch such a strong cast struggle so desperately to hold the film together while it falls apart around them
14885	3	a	A story of the heart brought beautifully to life.
14886	3	a	An escapist fantasy that women in the audience can enjoy by musing, 'I wish I had her problems' - and her car, house, wardrobe, figure and men, even wrong men.
14887	4	a	...a silly film that exists primarily as a vehicle for James... this marks the emergence of a comedy star who may get to fulfill the promise he shows here in films to come.
14888	6	a	It's telling that we don't find Messing's character worthy of a male prostitute's love.
14889	4	a	...it's got a title that perfectly matches its subject matter: They're both too long by half.
14890	0	a	This is a darkly funny, deeply moving and always audacious high wire act of a film that, much like its unforgettable heroine, obeys none of the rules or niceties and is all the more memorable and exciting because of it.
14891	0	a	People will tell you this is a deeply romantic film. Don't buy it - because you'll be missing out on the true value of the movie.
14892	5	a	It's a strictly date-night-rental affair, and if you still get Ryan Reynolds and Dane Cook confused, this will do little to help sort things out.
14893	3	a	The Soloist is at its best when it lets mysteries such as the power of music remain mysterious and at its worst when it tries to explain them.
14894	10	a	Even under the best of circumstances, there's nothing redeemable here.
14895	3	a	[Tim] Burton's marvellously imaginative view of the afterlife as a ghoulish extension of mundane earthbound problems is a visionary masterstroke crammed with wit and invention.
14896	4	a	"See it in the right sick frame of mind, and ""Tim and Eric's Billion Dollar Movie'' can be shockingly and terribly hilarious. Or not."
14897	3	a	Any film where John Ritter dies TWICE can't be all bad.
14898	9	a	This isn't a journey, it's a funeral procession.
14899	6	a	Too depressing to fill audiences with delight, but it does seem to validate questionable attitudes, especially an indifference to the suffering of innocent people and a willingness to shoot first and ask questions later.
14900	3	a	Meet the Fockers isn't quite as funny as its predecessor, but it definitely has its moments. 
14901	5	a	Sincerity is no substitute for dramatic excellence, and in this case Sayles's ambition proves far greater than his accomplishment.
14902	1	a	Tina Fey, the film's producer and star, keeps getting better and better in each of those positions. Here she hits a new high mark in both.
14903	0	a	Techs are a marvel across the board.
14904	6	a	Formulaically uplifting. More hagiography than biography, it winds up an inspirational tale told in an uninspired way.
14905	6	a	For maximum entertainment, a movie can't afford to waste so much time being its own carnival barker, relentlessly trying to drum up interest.
14906	5	a	Toy planes might fly at Christmas, but Flight of the Phoenix got stuck halfway down the chimney. Ho, Ho, No...
14907	4	a	A family film that proves surprisingly distinctive.
14908	3	a	Just give Theron the Oscar now. ... Rarely has an actor been given such an opportunity to play so far against type and rarely has she succeeded so well.
14909	6	a	Land of the Dead doesn't lack for creeps. It's just likely not the kind of complete frightfest that will have you wanting to go back for seconds.
14910	5	a	Frankly, it's painful to watch such a strong cast struggle so desperately to hold the film together while it falls apart around them
14911	4	a	Doesn't succumb to gratuitous violence or forehead-smacking stupidity. That sounds like smaller praise than it is.
14912	4	a	If you keep your expectations in check, the encounter doesn't disappoint.
14913	0	a	a beautiful, lyrical cinematic ode to lost souls finding each in an unlikely place
14914	6	a	This film's bleak and murky vision, and somewhat incomprehensible spiritual mumbo-jumbo storyline, just didn't do it for me.
14915	0	a	Cheadle's skillful performance makes Petey a flawed hero worth rooting for, even when his actions offend. Ejiofor also impresses with his subtle turn as the conflicted, success-hungry Dewey. In addition, the film boasts an excellent sound track.
14916	2	a	...The Assassination of Jesse James grabs on to many of the classic tropes of the Western -- the meandering passage of time, the imposing landscapes, the abiding loneliness, the casual violence -- and sets about mapping their furthest edges.
14917	3	a	Travolta wins hands down with his accent in a pleasingly intense performance that helps propel the story along.
14918	6	a	Here's a suggestion: hire a filmmaker with flair, someone capable of energizing this lame series beyond what it deserves -- someone who won't abide by the shock note.
14919	7	a	This film is nothing more than an excuse to cobble together some sketches, which range from utterly dull and stupid to mildly titillating due to some nude nubile actresses.
14920	3	a	It mostly succeeds ... in advancing the characters' dramatic arcs in interesting ways. I mean, who wouldn't want to watch old friends build a whorehouse together? 
14921	3	a	Stylishly directed and beautifully shot, The Great Beauty is an emotionally engaging and superbly acted Italian drama that plays like a modern day version of Fellini's La Dolce Vita.
14922	3	a	Will Smith finally makes the leap into romantic comedies with the delightful if somewhat predictable Hitch. Will, baby, what took you so long?
14923	6	a	That pounding you hear is the sound of nails going into Renee Zellwegger's career coffin
14924	6	a	If you weren't a kid when you first saw Space Jam, you're a lot less likely to find it palatable. [Blu-ray]
14925	9	a	So obsessively and so graphically bloody-minded that it comes perilously close to the pornography of violence.
14926	1	a	It's just about impossible to walk away disappointed from the thrills and beauties of Daggers.
14927	3	a	This third installment of the Final Destination franchise is the most disgusting, and viscerally enjoyable movie blood-bath in years.
14928	3	a	It's not a candy-coated version of teenage-dom. It's harsh, and awkward, and funny, just like being a teenager is.
14929	6	a	Like its predecessor, Crank: High Voltage is speedball cinema, a pure narcotized rush of blistering action, odious stereotypes, and shock-for-shock's-sake nastiness.
14930	7	a	A would-be sophisticated frolic so droopy and inane that the plot holes and dull performances almost obliterate the gorgeous visuals.
14931	3	a	This film has taken decades from conception to screen, but to Bening, it must feel as if it was meant to be.
14932	4	a	There is some violence but younger teens should enjoy it. However, it doesn't feel like it will spawn a frenzied following.
14933	0	a	The film is a zinger, with Hawke giving Toller the hungry, doomed conviction of a Graham Greene hero.
14934	1	a	Tim Burton's The Nightmare Before Christmas has a grotesque charm, a pie-eyed magic.
14935	5	a	The Darkest Minds is the latest Hunger Games knock-off to get the big screen treatment - and the latest to offer another clunky and melodramatically rendered dystopian future where adolescents are maltreated by adults who fear them.
14936	5	a	is beautiful to look at, but this feels like a Lifetime movie given the A-list treatment....in failing to steep us in Isabel's pain and mental state in act two, Cianfrance leaves us with an overly indulgent husband and self-centered wife in act three.
14937	1	a	The Light Between Oceans has one eye on the coming awards seasons, the other on delivering some wonderfully weepy entertainment. Expect success on both fronts.
14938	4	a	Crank: High Voltage is an extreme bit of lunacy that must be seen to be believed, just don't say you weren't warned about what you were getting into after wards.
14939	1	a	By the end of Lost in Translation, we don't know much about Japan, but we know a lot more about the human condition.
14940	4	a	There's no doubt that Jim Caviezel was put through the wringer here, and he gives a spiritual performance that's offset by the physical ordeal he had to endure during the torture scenes and the crucifixion.
14941	0	a	The film, and its cumulative emotional effect, is something of a brilliant, passionate, unflinching tour de force.
14942	7	a	Too long by about a half hour, very much in love with its own excessive style, it still manages to be kinda creepy, at least when it stops taking its metaphysics too seriously.
14943	3	a	[Angry Birds] proves to be more than just a gimmick, and doesn't skimp on any of the quirky wackiness that you might expect from a film about blob-shaped, flightless birds battling pigs.
14944	2	a	A film that verges on greatness, but -- due to occasional shallowness -- falls somewhat short.
14945	8	a	A fairly perfunctory sex comedy, which is too bad because the premise is amusing.
14946	7	a	On its own terms, Fantastic Four is a pretty lousy movie, but it looks even worse coming on the heels of so many recent first-rate comic book adaptations.
14947	5	a	It's not much of anything, apart from eye candy.
14948	4	a	Marvelous Will Smith and his mostly watchable supporting cast soldier on bravely, but they're marching straight into quicksand.
14949	2	a	Where John Carter continually gets it right is pacing, levity, and breadth of story.
14950	4	a	Merely another entry in the unnecessarily crowded field of Old Guy Befriends Young Boy and Teaches Him About Life movies.
14951	5	a	Bottom-drawer Bond.
14952	8	a	Paul Weitz's American Dreamz assembles a sumptuous buffet for the viewer, but since Weitz isn't hungry, he just stares at the spread, dumbly refusing to eat when really he should gorge.
14953	5	a	With a movie unwilling to go for the jugular, it's more like the dismal The Story of Us than The War of the Roses.
14954	1	a	Without a doubt, the script offers Lane her most well-rounded role since Unfaithful. 
14955	2	a	A measured, intelligent film that doesn't overplay its topicality or its anti-terrorist theme. As a showcase for Philip Seymour Hoffman's mastery of nuance, A Most Wanted Man also serves as a tribute to a singular talent taken far too early
14956	9	a	It's an insult to Jet Li's acrobatic talent, and also to DMX's svelte, feral intensity.
14957	0	a	Embrace of the Serpent is a clearly beautiful film, with images as poetic as its study of humanity's destructive impact on the earth and on each other
14958	5	a	The occasionally amusing puns and over-talented voice cast don't compensate enough for the meager story and the haphazard morals aimed at indiscriminating children.
14959	4	a	Resolutely downbeat, this tale of Victorian gender-bendering scores thanks to skilful performances, particularly from Close and McTeer, and a exhaustive attention to period detail.
14960	3	a	Jurassic Park III may be extinct from memory before you leave the multiplex, but it's still dino-mite summer movie fare.
14961	6	a	The Foxx-Farrell pairing can best be summed up by the first real Crockett-Tubbs scene in the film: on the rooftop of a club, on the phone... having separate conversations. The two share the frame and the on-set air but nothing else.
14962	3	a	SKYFALL has everything you love about Bond from yesteryear; and infuses the modern elements that resuscitated the character.
14963	9	a	An anachronistic mess made of cliched characters and situations...
14964	3	a	Guillermo Del Toro has long been a filmmaker who devotes nearly all of his energy to visual style, but he finds a solid foundation for his twin fascinations of elaborate production design and body horror in this Gothic ghost story.
14965	4	a	a Tyler Perry movie for the rest of America, without so much melodrama
14966	4	a	The good news is that once the talking stuffed animals of Christopher Robin's past come into the picture, one cannot help but be charmed, indeed won over by all involved, the screenwriters expertly mining Pooh's singular philosophies.
14967	4	a	Entertaining, and occasionally inspired, but Ralph Breaks The Internet is too often content to achieve a quick laugh, rather than exploring the themes its set-up suggests.
14968	10	a	Just call it 'Aliens for Dummies'--dark, murky, loud, gory and incredibly dull.
14969	3	a	It's gruesome and nasty and a heck of a lot of fun for people who get a kick out of Fangoria.
14970	9	a	Here's a sentence I never thought I'd write: Carmen Electra is more interesting than Steve Martin.
14971	3	a	Deliver Us From Evil proceeds with a sober clarity that lends credence to its devastating case.
14972	1	a	[A] raucous adventure into infinity.
14973	5	a	It ranges from try-hard indie-movie to pointless prat-falls. A waste of talent and your time.
14974	5	a	"The cut-rate production resulted in what Reeve termed ""catastrophe"" for a film intended to marry a serious message to the series' signature action, humor, and romance."
14975	1	a	"In a year of outstanding documentaries, ""Tupac: Resurrection"" rates up there with the best."
14976	4	a	A movie that manages to make both sex and violence dull.
14977	6	a	Screenwriters Mark Schwahn, Marc Hyman and Jon Zack can't decide whether they want Perfect Score to be funny or serious, with the result that it falls short of being either.
14978	4	a	As my son says, 'The books were a lot better.'
14979	4	a	click for full review [Greek]
14980	3	a	Productively acknowledge real-life dangers, with stellar animation and designs shoring up the storytelling of Johnston and Pamela Ribon's witty script...a useful all-ages fable for our time.
14981	3	a	A Big Men Shouting movie that works.
14982	4	a	When it sets out to capture some of the meandering aimlessness of teenagehood, it succeeds.
14983	5	a	Sly's boxing saga begins to go lightweight.
14984	0	a	Figuring out when to laugh or cry, and why, is what this unforgettable black comedy is all about. You'll do both. 
14985	3	a	Cockeyed and raffishly amusing tale of redemption, spilling over with blues music and southern-fried sexism.
14986	3	a	While cruder than the first film, Rocky II successfully drives its hero back to the underdog status needed to make the final fight as exciting and satisfying as it is.
14987	1	a	The dynamic that operates throughout this film is fantasy versus reality, not just in the lives of the characters but in American life in general.
14988	8	a	It's unlikely that even WALL-E could bring himself to scoop up this movie and leave it on his post-apocalyptic junk heap.
14989	1	a	A very cool satire.
14990	4	a	This appears to be a breakout role for the talented and charismatic Chou, whose star should rise in Hollywood. The movie is full of visual eye candy that includes use of a split screen and rapid editing to speed up the car chases and...
14991	3	a	Valentine or propaganda? No matter how you swing it, this is an energetic introduction to the Godfather of Gangsta.
14992	1	a	The movie rarely loses its grip and is a remarkable accomplishment.
14993	5	a	The environment in which stories like The Hunger Games or Divergent gained followings has changed, and The Darkest Minds has not adapted to survive it.
14994	4	a	It's well-intentioned subject matter that's handled, for the most part, rather poorly by Clint Eastwood...
14995	3	a	Valentino: The Last Emperor makes no attempt at being a definitive portrait of Valentino. It is content to be a breezy look at the designer's twilight years.
14996	5	a	Not even the great Michel Piccoli can save a film with little bite but too much forced humor
14997	6	a	With Myrtle inexplicably running up haute couture outfits for the locals as part of her unclear scheme, the film is as superficial as a catwalk parade.
14998	2	a	Russell is a cool and clever director, with a vision all his own.
14999	3	a	The screenplay by Andrew Bovell ... is not as concerned with matters of plot as it is with the mysteries of morality and justice playing out behind the scenes.
15000	2	a	Romantic, sweet without being cloying, and light on its feet.
15001	4	a	Though there are no real belly laughs or any Farrelly-like set pieces, this is still a better than average comedy, thanks to its witty script and its amusing collection of characters.
15002	3	a	Director Paul McGuigan... gets great performances from his leads, making a virtue of their chemistry together, particularly in the early joyous stages of their relationship when Peter, charmingly, has no idea who Grahame is.
15003	4	a	...the film's only sublime moments happen in scenes where the population gets blown up.
15004	3	a	The picture may be too wholesome and twee for fans' of the director's edgier work like Almost Famous but it deserves to be a big hit with families.
15005	4	a	A fresh and amusing teen comedy all about the anxiety of trying to find a date for the prom.
15006	6	a	A missed opportunity to make a smart, affectionately witty skewering of obsessive fanboy culture.
15007	3	a	Early Tim Burton is creepy, dark fun for tweens and teens.
15008	1	a	A classic European film noir with an irresistible score by Miles Davis, it builds tension from a series of seemingly minor mistakes that echo the political/military context of the postwar era.
15009	4	a	okay for what it is
15010	4	a	While a fuel cell or two short of animation's final frontier, Astro Boy capably fills the space between Jimmy Neutron: Boy Genius and Wall.E.
15011	3	a	The Angry Birds franchise keeps growing and now it does so with splendid animation and the funny and explosive shennanigans of the characters of the game. [Full review in Spanish]
15012	4	a	If there's an overarching theme it's that people respond to incentives and so regulation of the financial market is necessary to see that the incentives offered are not perverse.
15013	1	a	The film may lack grit but the stellar cast adds to its allure, helping to round out this dynamic account where reinvention offers the means to endure.
15014	1	a	With the help of acting giants, [director Tamara] Jenkins turns The Savages into a twisted, bittersweet pleasure.
15015	5	a	It suits a lot of people, but I find it hypocritical and false.
15016	2	a	The entire story behind John Carter is the essence of high concept, especially in the day and age it was originally created... a blast of a film.
15017	5	a	No doubt about it, to divulge the plot would spoil the experience -- you'll be shocked to discover, and maybe even surprised to learn, just how lame the damn thing really is.
15018	1	a	I suspect I'll watch this movie over and over. It's simply a blast.
15019	5	a	A rote comedy that tries to pay tribute to this much-maligned subculture, but instead resorts to lazy stereotypes and comedy conventions.
15020	2	a	One of those relatively rare comedies that's at once puerile, charming and very funny throughout.
15021	5	a	Towne just doesn't capture his subject.
15022	2	a	Funny to me, but maybe not for everyone. Hell, I don't care, you're either in the category of the type of person who will like this or you're not. The choice is yours, but anyone pre-disposed to like this type of film will be happy they took the trip.
15023	1	a	"Happily, despite all the technical details, ""The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey"" is exciting, tantalizing and satisfying."
15024	9	a	The first film was bad, the second worse, and the third almost unbearable.
15025	3	a	The drama is low-key, the theme of short term pain versus long term gain is intriguingly explored, it may not have the gung-ho action that some audiences demand but it is a solid well-made thriller.
15026	4	a	Life or Something Like It has its share of high points, but it misses too many opportunities.
15027	1	a	By the end of the movie, when all your questions have been answered, you're left with the exhilarating high of having been manipulated by a gifted artist in a diabolically dark mood.
15028	5	a	What could've been sleek and subtle is loud, garish and unwieldy.
15029	5	a	A movie that isn't smart enough to realize how stupid it really is.
15030	4	a	Entertaining strictly as a big-budget soap opera.
15031	3	a	If a group of your witty, talented and absolutely committed friends made a movie, this is the kind of truly 'indie' film to which they would aspire.
15032	0	a	A rich, resonant meditation of male romantic obsession ... Not only does Hitchcock demonstrate a total mastery of cinematic point-of-view, but he turns what might have been mere melodrama into film poetry. Perhaps his greatest film.
15033	3	a	If you're about to enter the world of The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo for the first time, this is a terrific place to start.
15034	7	a	[...] one would expect events to be gradually fleshed out until the mystery behind the attack is finally revealed, just in time for a bodacious climax, right? Yeah.
15035	3	a	Crowe, who aims high to plant a big smile on your face, does so here more than competently.
15036	7	a	A dark, stupid tale.
15037	0	a	Still proves as thrilling as ever.
15038	3	a	If a little twee for grown-ups, this is riotous fun for kids. Even if it's not Pixar-perfect, it'll definitely do until Up touches down.
15039	3	a	What animates this dramatically constrained film are the lively words and the vitality of nature. An image of butterflies blooming in a bedroom is Keats' worldview in miniature.
15040	2	a	Enchanted is a sugar spun delight. It's as fluffy as a bunch of newborn bunnies and as cute as an entire collection of buttons.
15041	5	a	Chuck actually goes much further and becomes more sexually crude than Apatow's work, and its attempts to become redemptively cute are way too saccharine.
15042	4	a	Though never boring, American Hustle does itself feel a little like a con - a skilled exercise in creative misdirection.
15043	9	a	Mean-spirited, ugly little movie.
15044	2	a	Hitchcock may be taking liberties in its ideas about the director's psyche, but it's a genuinely entertaining movie.
15045	9	a	Williams, of course, has been doing a gruff-turns-to-lovable schtick as opposed to any organic acting for more than half of his motion picture career, so his work here is what one might call dreadfully predictable.
15046	3	a	It's both better than its earlier reputation, which was based on the cut version, and yet still disappointing in some ways.
15047	4	a	A strong early effort from Jane Campion.
15048	8	a	Cross Crossover off your list of movies to see.
15049	4	a	At its heart, this a fluffy genre parody that knows exactly what it is and economically fulfills the mandate of its limited goals without veering off toward the grating self-indulgence of Spaceballs.
15050	5	a	It's a crass, exaggerated, intermittently intriguing gimmick concept of visual effects that wears thin very quickly.
15051	7	a	...talent does not matter much, just as long as the women?who, of course, all look like supermodels?wear skimpy, transparent outfits throughout the movie.
15052	9	a	Despite all the state-of-the-art weaponry, it's a total misfire.
15053	6	a	What Hannibal Rising is, mostly, is a hoot. Gong Li cautions the nightmare-plagued Hannibal that 'Memory is a knife -- it can hurt you.' And let's not forget the classic, 'They ate my sister.'
15054	4	a	That the film works in spite of the people behind the camera says a lot for the people in front of the camera.
15055	4	a	Goofy contemporary western that mixes Chicago hoods as rustlers riding in sedans with real Wyoming cowboys on horseback chasing them in a dude ranch setting.
15056	2	a	The film's cool, distant beauty is mirrored in the performance of the wonderful Cate Blanchett, who plays the wealthy, older and experienced Carol. As Therese, whose infatuation with Carol opens her eyes to who she is and what she desires.
15057	5	a	This movie lost me when it started comparing the plight of a fictional teddy bear to that of the slaves. Umm...no. 
15058	4	a	It never rises past a second-rate thriller.
15059	6	a	Cholodenko's tepid melodrama is an exercise in boilerplate storytelling.
15060	5	a	A hip-hop Cheech and Chong picture crossed with Animal House that's about as cheerfully vulgar as you might expect.
15061	9	a	When Justin Timberlake is the best thing about a film, you know you're in trouble.
15062	1	a	Vengeance is the ace card in this rough game of acquiring justice in a cloaked system with degenerates at every turn. And, it's a heavyweight component of the Trilogy's impact no matter the medium used for its telling.
15063	6	a	If you can forgive some woeful casting and a plot that is as creakingly thin as an old staircase, you can enjoy director Christopher Nolan's The Prestige.
15064	3	a	This funny and subversive film is by no means as unwatchable as some people have made Makavejev's work out to be.
15065	3	a	It's all silly but remarkably fun and should wring smiles from even the grouchiest cat lover.
15066	10	a	That's how awful this picture is. It can't even come up with new diarrhea jokes.
15067	1	a	One of the year's most crackling adventure films, one of Bond's most satisfying outings, and proof that you can indeed teach an old horndog new tricks.
15068	5	a	Darker than the original, not for very young kids.
15069	5	a	The tone baffles and wobbles. This is one of the least visually appealing films ever to go out under the Disney banner.
15070	4	a	Its commercial compromises cripple it as a movie.
15071	6	a	Thanks to its two leads, the film remains vivid, honest and deeply felt.
15072	4	a	This is a fact-rich but drama-poor film, constructed with professionalism but lacking passion.
15073	3	a	In terms of creating a strong cinematic world, Tarr has few equals.
15074	4	a	A well-meant, if not exactly transcendent, adaptation of Elizabeth Gilbert's beloved, Oprah-endorsed memoir.
15075	3	a	I, Robot is that rare entry among summer blockbusters -- a film with something on its mind. 
15076	3	a	Shot in blotchy, grimy black-and-white and edited in a style almost reminiscent of the French New Wave, 'Pi' is as jarring to the eye as it is enticing to the mind.
15077	6	a	Blood and Wine is a murky attempt at film noir that has a couple of good twists, but overall it wastes its talent.
15078	6	a	Musically explosive, emotionally powerful and flat-out funky, Get on Up tells the outrageous life story of James Brown with a quirky brilliance worthy of the man at its center.
15079	3	a	In the end, The Soloist isn't about BIG MOMENTS, it's about the grace notes, the kind that stay with you.
15080	3	a	A finely drawn human drama, it just fails to go far enough with the supernatural elements.
15081	4	a	It is a rare feat to make a sequel better than its predecessor but here Sonnenfeld manages to do just that.
15082	6	a	This is an affectionate and good-hearted movie that could've been a whole lot better and could've been a whole lot worse.
15083	3	a	Evelyn's strong cast and surehanded direction make for a winning, heartwarming yarn.
15084	5	a	Segues between its various pawns before coldly, cruelly sending them to their execution.
15085	9	a	If every cloud has a silver lining, my lining is that my year-end worst list is one film closer to completion.
15086	9	a	Everything that's good [in the film] has a downside, and everything that doesn't work has something that keeps it from failing completely.
15087	5	a	A comedy without the laughs, and an action film with a non-existent level of excitement, Blue Streak is an obvious and misguided effort.
15088	1	a	Once again, Shults has delivered a top-notch psychological thriller.
15089	4	a	... its relevance grows in times when tempers are easily exasperated and the use of violence is privileged. Here it is, I insist, the best of Selma. [Full review in Spanish]
15090	3	a	Perhaps some day the original Asimov stories will make it to the screen... [T]his I, Robot is one of the best science-fiction films we're likely to see this year. 
15091	0	a	For all its bleakness and disillusion, there is a poignant innocence in it.
15092	3	a	As a boxing movie, Against the Ropes is perfunctory... As a biopic, it's likewise uninspired stuff.
15093	3	a	Has all the elements for a memorable farce and succeeds more often than not.
15094	3	a	Every frame of Inti Briones's starkly gorgeous black-and-white cinematography ... hints at an inherent contradiction, either visually, in the narrative or in its larger themes.
15095	1	a	A gift that keeps on giving, The Artist is a film that demands your attention at every moment. All senses are glued to the screen and director Michel Hazanavicius delivers with drama, laughter, romance and stellar performances from his cast. 
15096	8	a	The idea of more kids getting lost in the hidden interstates of Texas, lining up for the slaughter is, frankly, fairly boring. I mean, come on...even Police Academy went to Miami Beach for their fifth film.
15097	2	a	A look into how war can change the lives of not only those on the frontlines but those covering an everlasting conflict in a strange land as told by an authentic voice that's part funny, parts moving, and indeed parts frustrating
15098	4	a	This could have been a leftfield little gem, but LaBute struggles somewhat with the light comedy. and there's also the small plot problem: since Betty is as mad as a bag of baboons, it's difficult to really sympathise with her.
15099	7	a	Although it's got the shortest running time of anything we've seen all year, Jonah Hex doesn't feel so much snappily paced as it does rushed and disjointed. 
15100	9	a	King's Ransom deserves to be bashed, burned, and have its ashes scattered over Hollywood
15101	2	a	Unlike in its predecessor, The Fault in Our Stars, the path to pubescent enlightenment in Paper Towns is more literal than existential, giving your tear ducts the night off at the cost of something a little deeper.
15102	9	a	The unappealing cross-country trip of a dog, a cat, and a hamster.
15103	1	a	Although Clockers is, as I suggested, a murder mystery, in solving its murder, it doesn't even begin to find a solution to the system that led to the murder. That is the point.
15104	4	a	Relies upon dread over cheap scares, and for an extended period the film flies above and beyond the expectations of a cold-opening January horror release.
15105	6	a	Memoirs of a Geisha, the big-screen adaptation of Arthur Golden's best-selling novel, has a lesson to teach: Designing a movie isn't the same as directing one.
15106	3	a	"Hitchcock"" marks the first time Hopkins and Mirren have appeared together on-screen, and it's as fun to watch as you'd imagine."
15107	8	a	The moment the movie loses its lighthearted spirit is the moment it loses touch with reality.
15108	9	a	The result is shrill and charmless.
15109	5	a	"Competently directed, and delivered with the expected emotional beats, ""Still Alice"" achieves its modest goals, but one wishes it had a grander vision."
15110	7	a	Mawkish, manipulative, bombastic tearjerker [that] seems more about making a statement than translating the story into affecting drama.
15111	3	a	"Call Me By Your Name"" is a visually stunning coming-of-age story that boasts a star-making performance by Chalamet."
15112	6	a	While The Lazarus Effect isn't the worst scary movie film you'll see this year, it is probably one of the most predictable and lazily plotted.
15113	4	a	"For a robust action story about three people from very different backgrounds attempting to make a positive influence on their world, ""Hancock"" is a step in the right direction."
15114	2	a	Director Bryan Singer keeps the pace fast, and although we know the ultimate outcome, it's easy to get caught up in the excitement of what-if thinking.
15115	3	a	This film isn't pretty, but it has some kick: It is to Shakespeare in Love what wild pheasant is to Chicken McNuggets.
15116	3	a	We're as fascinated by his eccentricity as we are impressed at his high standards and taste.
15117	3	a	Bourne aspires only to be a fun popcorn movie -- and, for the most part, it is.
15118	3	a	The Prestige isn't art, but it reaps a lot of fun out of the question, How did they do that?
15119	6	a	Just when it seemed there was no other possible way to copy a cat, they prove you wrong.
15120	9	a	Bad movies just don't come any sadder than Life or Something Like It, a shapeless, miserable mess.
15121	4	a	Like its four-armed Tharks and its ten-legged Calot, this adaptation of Edgar Rice Burroughs's series of sci-fi novels has too many moving parts for its own good.
15122	4	a	[It] manages to make off with just enough laughs to work, thanks to the wondrous McCarthy, one of the few actresses in Hollywood allowed to showcase her wit and charisma as much as her physique.
15123	2	a	A refreshing and assured meditation on tolerance that does a darn good job of masquerading as a zombie shoot-em-up.
15124	0	a	The Southern-Gothic-lite tapestry Rapp builds allows Altman to do some of his most nuanced storytelling.
15125	3	a	Staggers down that fine line between sentimental and snarky
15126	4	a	What starts off as something quite slick slowly devolves into something resembling a typically generic anime film. What a shame.
15127	2	a	Every now and then a small, intelligent, quietly thought-provoking film slips through the Hollywood studios' net and prompts the thought, How did this ever get made?
15128	3	a	Even though a little less Hitch might have been a better thing, the Fresh Prince keeps the proceedings from becoming too stale.
15129	4	a	As uncomplicatedly likeable and effortlessly rootable as its main character and star, The Imitation Game ultimately wins at any easy game, when it could have risked - and revealed - so much more.
15130	5	a	Quite scary at times, intriguing ideas and a good cast, including Ian McShane and Adrian Lester, are used badly.
15131	5	a	This generic offering simply doesn't transcend the tropes of the genre at hand.
15132	4	a	If you can get past all the over-bearing 'Live your life for the moment' message, the movie can make your two hours pass by with a fair amount of enjoyment.
15133	3	a	With the gargantuan amount of talent invested in this production, it just seems churlish to quibble over details.
15134	5	a	Decent actors wasted; impossible, idiotic plot twists; an unimaginative shooting style; an okay but unspectacular bit of action. Yep, it's a February movie all right.
15135	6	a	Never overcomes its overly familiar story and structure, even with some catchy traditional music generously spread throughout.
15136	1	a	Rosamund Pike gives the performance of her career in this honest, extraordinary tribute to Marie Colvin and war correspondents, which couldn't come at a more prescient time.
15137	3	a	You can enjoy the lowbrow apocalypse as surreal theater.
15138	2	a	A genuinely creepy and deeply disturbing experience, as would be expected by fans of the games
15139	5	a	"Tim Blake Nelson, credited as producer / screenwriter / play author / editor / director for ""The Grey Zone"" has taken a huge bite of a grim story of insurrection and destruction, leavened with spiritual salvation, and makes it, overall, boring and tedious"
15140	2	a	"Kate Winslet as sexy femme fatale with a wicked pair of shears is a lot of fun. As her mum ""Mad"" Molly, Judy David triumphs."
15141	3	a	Rather than a groundbreaking piece of new gadgetry, this thriller is like an old, well-oiled machine.
15142	4	a	"Since I would give the visual portion of ""Arctic Tale"" the maximum number of stars and the audio portion the minimum, I suppose that I will have to split the difference and give the film as a whole the middle amount."
15143	5	a	Not as bad as its release date implies nor as good as its creative team suggests.
15144	4	a	Any charm in having such content delivered by a talking teddy bear has officially worn off by now. None of this is really even all that shocking -- just bland.
15145	0	a	Forget the Christmas connection: This all-timer can be watched any time of the year.
15146	3	a	Stiller plays a familiar character with a nice energy and presence, making the most of all his character's asides and observations.
15147	3	a	Focus may not be an important film, but it's an easy pill to swallow.
15148	6	a	...it flies on and on until its power to hold us simply peters out.
15149	6	a	Even with its limping screenplay and general drift toward competence rather than excellence, Birdman does pull us well enough into its fistful of compelling characters.
15150	2	a	"Largely sweet and insubstantial, not so much ""funny"" as it is charming and grin-making."
15151	6	a	By the expedited conclusion it all feels less like a Peter Berg film and just another chapter in Will Smith's tentpole history of major creative failures.
15152	3	a	"Aside from maybe ""Friday Night Lights,"" I can't think of another recent sports movie that dared to suggest athletic achievement isn't a worthy goal in and of itself. "
15153	4	a	This is a movie that literally wallows in its base and crude story making you itch and run for the shower after exiting the theater.
15154	1	a	A charming ensemble piece, that may be the ultimate campus comedy, about media-fixated, affectless youngsters who became spokepersons for Generation X
15155	6	a	Eleanor Coppola serves it up as nice and light as a sweet French pastry until it finally falls flat in an unfulfilling final act. 
15156	1	a	A real crowd pleaser with laughs so big and often that you're going to miss some of the lines.
15157	8	a	Be thankful that its star, a singer, dancer, mother, and woman of the world, has plenty of day jobs to go back to.
15158	6	a	If you've had a hard week, it provides a healthy dose of whatever.
15159	5	a	A stronger screenplay and more sensitive direction would have made this movie into something far more genuinely uplifting than it is.
15160	7	a	Jim O'Hanlon's drama offers forgettable performances and mediocre BBC One-level melodrama.
15161	4	a	What the movie does that the book couldn't do is tap into the poignancy that comes of seeing two stars who used to be young and beautiful suddenly looking very mortal.
15162	4	a	The jokes are surprising timely, reminding viewers of the ways men and women are held to different standards.
15163	4	a	A charming eye-roller with a nice streak that goes deep.
15164	3	a	If you like heart attacks with your movie-nights out, then sign yourself up for the war.
15165	4	a	A very irregular and minor filme in the work of Ang Lee, which, however, deserves to be applauded for the courage with which criticizes the excessive American patriotism. [Full review in Spanish]
15166	4	a	The Joneses starts with a fresh identity but finally feels like the product of a focus group.
15167	6	a	"Despite its stars, despite its premise, and despite the presence of cute canines, ""Must Love Dogs"" is the most bland romantic comedy of the summer. Possibly of the year."
15168	3	a	A superbly written, brilliantly acted and frequently surprising film that is by turns sexy, shocking and ultimately moving.
15169	7	a	Like much of MacFarlane's work, A Million Ways suffers from an inability to maintain consistent characters or to make plot funny.
15170	3	a	A raw slice of life that goes beyond the obvious external issues.
15171	3	a	"Given its stark visuals, its authentic acting by non professionals, and its humanism, ""Capernaum"" has become the obvious entry by Lebanon to our Academy Awards."
15172	3	a	Anton Corbijn's new thriller is perhaps the best so far to tackle the War on Terror, thanks to an ingeniously twisty, and deeply cynical, storyline plus a towering performance from Philip Seymour Hoffman ...
15173	2	a	The weakest film in the three, which is a disappointing way to wrap up a trilogy, but once it stumbles past its lumbering first act it warms up considerably.
15174	1	a	[Russell] seems to be having obscene amounts of fun, which becomes contagious very quickly.
15175	4	a	Skyfall is not, of course, ''darker'' or more serious than previous Bond films, but it's more knowing about its own conventions.
15176	1	a	A delightfully vicious film that's bound to piss off everyone.
15177	3	a	"If ever [the characters in] a film embodied Hannah Arendt's principle of ""the banality of evil"", it's The Tin Drum..."
15178	0	a	The look of the film is absolutely gorgeous.
15179	0	a	It's a flawlessly crafted, stirringly intelligent, resonantly emotional story about two women daring to follow their hearts.
15180	2	a	If the destination seems inevitable, there are some nice bits along the way.
15181	3	a	There's a lot of the unspoken in Call Me by Your Name, a perceptive film about lust, jealousy, uncertainty, repression, and, maybe, love.
15182	3	a	The social commentary isn't subtle, but Romero delivers the goods so effectively that many won't even notice.
15183	6	a	Feels like three bad movies instead of one good one. Not as bad as SPANGLISH, but stil...
15184	5	a	I found this tale of a space-station crew testing a device that could end Earth's energy crisis to have some great moments, but largely suffering from being too derivative and, on occasion, barely comprehensible.
15185	5	a	Un intento forzado por seguir explotando el personaje de Hannibal Lecter, vistosamente filmado y producido pero sin otra excusa argumental que intentar explicar lo inexplicable.
15186	8	a	The greatest trick New Line Cinema ever pulled was convincing the world that it had something of great amusement behind their decision to hold Snakes from view up to the last minute. Now that the slither is out of the bag, let the yawns begin.
15187	3	a	Nicolas Cage is so gleefully over-the-top as the troubled cop of the title that you will either be repulsed or fascinated by his performance and, since it lives or dies by it, the movie itself.
15188	5	a	There are nice moments, but this is pure bombast, and Chan's natural action flair is not given free rein.
15189	5	a	Ya gotta love the skydiving Elvis impersonators.
15190	8	a	In terms of actual laughs, this is somewhere between a scorching STD and a sleepy corporate-gig Dennis Miller show.
15191	4	a	Nowhere near as bad as The Fault In Our Stars.
15192	4	a	[A] well-acted film about making the move from the street to the mainstream.
15193	8	a	A rancid, unfunny disaster full of embarrassing performances and shamefully simple-minded comic notions.
15194	8	a	"Manufactured and manicured to appeal to the teenage fans of the book, ""Paper Towns"" is polished and edgeless."
15195	4	a	Reminds us, sweetly, charmingly, and humorously, what Will Smith used to be like before he became an overnight action sensation.
15196	4	a	It's a steamy, searing saga of rigorous redemption confronting creepy Southern seediness. But it's not nearly the wake-up call it could have been.
15197	6	a	If you didn't see and laugh at the first Ted, and maybe also at MacFarlane's button-pushing TV series Family Guy, then another movie deserves your entertainment dollars.
15198	7	a	...packed with situations that only exist to provide punchlines and actors talking about love without convincing that they're in it. 
15199	0	a	This is one of [the Coens'] best films, yet, its indelible images resonating long after the final credits roll.
15200	4	a	While you're watching the movie, it's hard not to get caught up in all the fun. Black and company are having a blast here, and it's infectious.
15201	0	a	Sean Penn steps behind the camera to craft one of the most powerful films of the year.
15202	4	a	It's all painstakingly done - but not quite as involving as it should be.
15203	6	a	Inevitably there are some funny moments, and of course this is an endlessly watchable cast. But the movie is just too over-the-top.
15204	6	a	Logan Lucky is momentarily entertaining, but it is very quickly forgettable; a minor work from one of American cinema's most restless mainstream filmmakers that has such little impact, he might as well have remained in retirement.
15205	6	a	One of those infamous 'based on a true story' movies in which just about everything is a lie.
15206	3	a	Ready Player One is a feast of nostalgia, action and visual style, which more than makes up for its fairly minor narrative shortfalls.
15207	5	a	Unfortunately, the filmmakers forget that the most important part of an in-joke is the joke.
15208	4	a	Director Brian De Palma does his stylish best to weave the patchy script into a cinematic quilt, but despite his best efforts -- and they're often formidable -- the thing just doesn't cohere.
15209	4	a	It's homespun homily time: TALL TALE may look like a rousing adventure story for the whole family, but it's really a vehicle for the kind of tiresome moral aphorisms that only William Bennett could love. . .
15210	6	a	This movie is nothing more than a classily cast disaster, a Something About Mary meets Meet the Parents train wreck we've seen too many times before.
15211	0	a	The film's goals are in the right place: character development and character growth.
15212	5	a	The more Harris has milked his creation, the more ludicrous Hannibal has become, the mystique of inexplicable monstrousness diminished with each appearance.
15213	1	a	What makes it so haunting is the sensitivity to its lead characters and their unusual plight.
15214	3	a	Imaginative, ridiculously anachronistic and distinctly masculine, this is Disney's best traditional animation effort since The Emperor's New Groove.
15215	4	a	The Other Boleyn Girl works both as an engagingly sordid meditation on protofeminism and contemporized sisterhood set in a time and a place where either/or were grounds for, at the very least, defenestration.
15216	4	a	Though ultimately something less than the sum of its parts, the film's performances are reason enough to see it.
15217	6	a	Really stupid.
15218	9	a	...a curiously sloppy attempt to resuscitate the franchise.
15219	6	a	It's sad that the overall script is so lacking because there are a few glimmers of brilliance. 
15220	3	a	It's big and loud and busy and a whole lot of fun. 
15221	3	a	Its unique oddball blend of fatalistic Hemingway-esque masculinity, swoony romance and mythology, literary allusions...and grab bag of styles...makes Pandora and the Flying Dutchman nearly as hypnotic as the romance it retells. [Blu-ray]
15222	0	a	"Button"" ends up being an eloquent and moving tale that keeps all its lighter and darker elements in near-perfect balance."
15223	4	a	Some of the gags are more cringy than others -- like Craig Robinson's cracka-hating box of grits -- but don't call it empty calories.
15224	0	a	In its consideration of the commercialization of evangelical Christianity for an audience that has no time for the teachings of Christ, First Reformed's concerns are entirely of the moment.
15225	4	a	Features bursts of humor and electrifying energy offset by speechifying and a dud of a subplot.
15226	3	a	There's no denying its technical bravado and the haunting power of its subject.
15227	3	a	Douglas makes for a sympathetic and wily hero.
15228	2	a	Spielberg is the master of telling a visual story, and here he is in top form.
15229	3	a	Deliberately awkward and bravely subversive.
15230	3	a	Much fun amongst WWII w/Eastwood, Savalas, Sutherland, and Rickles.
15231	3	a	In a world of depression and negativity, this is a fun, optimistic and positive film. It is an emotional, feel-good movie with a solid message. Be who you are. Love yourself.
15232	0	a	In a time when movies often are sonic assaults, and meaning can be lost amid the clatter of explosions, gunshots and screeching cars, The Artist has an utterly beguiling purity.
15233	7	a	"[VIDEO ESSAY] The best thing the movie does is that it reminds us that we too will wither and die - some sooner than later. Eat some pizza. Smoke a bowl. Any of those experiences will far surpass the one you will have watching ""Inherent Vice."
15234	6	a	In the end, Entrapment's cleverly convoluted plot is its least confusing aspect.
15235	3	a	Fun, flashy musical with Banderas in early role.
15236	0	a	There's leisure to the storytelling, a splendor that captures the movie's celebratory but also melancholy ideas about our time on this mortal coil.
15237	0	a	Bob and Charlotte's relationship in particular is exquisitely portrayed; a sort of platonic romance, it's a relationship that exists because of the things that aren't said between them just as much as the things that are
15238	4	a	Meddles uneasily between comedy, romance and thrills
15239	2	a	[Paul Thomas Anderson's new movie] is a kind of companion piece to Altman's The Long Goodbye, and it's the sort of failure that only a director of his talents could make.
15240	4	a	For all its technical beauty, there's something lacking. It often feels a bit like Spielberg phoned the film in or at the very least painted it by numbers.
15241	6	a	If Against the Ropes were a comedy, it would be called Pugilistally Blonde.
15242	3	a	A Most Wanted Man concludes on a bleakly prescient note, not only in offering an extraordinarily trenchant critique of American foreign policy but also as a moody send off to Hoffman himself. 
15243	5	a	Misfire offers talking characters, forgettable musical score.
15244	3	a	Aspires to be both a whammo action blockbuster and an intelligent think piece...a delicate balance for any film to pull off.
15245	1	a	Matches The Dinner Game laugh for laugh.
15246	3	a	This film's strength comes from how it lulls you into a dream world that you are a little suspicious of, only to get blindsided by the truly dark side of revenge.
15247	3	a	Guatemala's first-ever Oscar entry is an absorbing, beautifully-shot drama of cultural ritual and the drive of one young woman to escape a rudimentary social system.
15248	3	a	It's funny, involving and touching in nice doses. Plus it stars Hailee Steinfeld and features our longtime pal Woody Harrelson. Kelly Fremon Craig has made a dandy directorial debut.
15249	6	a	With nowhere to go except toward that incongruous moral, the story is getting thin on the ground, obliging director Jorge Blanco to pad with the usual plush stuffing -- bland action and busy edits.
15250	4	a	"Twohy correctly banks on the fact that his audience will be too busy sifting through those aforementioned ""red snappers"" to care about the details."
15251	3	a	Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets is superior to its predecessor in every way: It's more thrilling, more entertaining and, yep, more magical.
15252	3	a	In the end, The Good Girl is about the way we all delude ourselves into believing those things we need to believe in order to get by.
15253	2	a	This comedy/romance story is about communication and being in touch with yourself.
15254	5	a	"Due"" Should Never Have Been Found"
15255	0	a	Filmmakers Joel and Ethan Coen build and sustain tension so masterfully throughout this adaptation of Cormac McCarthy's novel that even trouble that's been telegraphed still shocks when it arrives.
15256	9	a	Alba is bad, but her co-stars are worse. Stockwell can't get a decent performance out of any of them. Even the sharks seem to be hamming it up.
15257	5	a	Eastwood has pondered both mortality and spirituality before and far more successfully.
15258	9	a	There's a good bit of gore, bad plumbing and standard psychotic bad housekeeping, but not much more.
15259	3	a	A movie that will thrill you, touch you and make you laugh as well.
15260	4	a	A well-done Hungarian black comedy set in Budapest's underground subway system.
15261	5	a	Aaron Eckhart plays the thoroughly modern monster, caught up in a battle between good and evil that threatens all mankind. Somehow he finds time for romance.
15262	3	a	After Columbine, this dark comedy isn't as funny.
15263	7	a	Like many video games, Resident Evil has a drearily long setup, then a lot of blood and gore, then an overextended ending.
15264	7	a	Little man, little effort, little result.
15265	5	a	"Poor story choices and strange, if not outright silly, character decisions result in an experience that will ultimately leave audiences feeling a great amount of ""meh""."
15266	9	a	Don't expect to laugh more than five times and you won't be disappointed.
15267	4	a	Their brand of scatological nonsense may have found its most favorable home on the big screen.
15268	5	a	The problem isn't just that MacFarlane is a bad actor, but that Anna's character makes absolutely no sense.
15269	1	a	What begins as a patient and unvarnished look inside one man's depression escalates into a crazed psychic and spiritual unravelling.
15270	3	a	On the one hand, it is a masterful piece of craftsmanship, replete with outstanding cinematography, set design and special effects makeup work. On the other hand, it's slow-paced and overstuffed, not to mention
15271	4	a	Requires little brain-power to contemplate its almost non-existent plot; instead, it tries to sustain audiences with one dinosaur chase after another.
15272	3	a	Slick, sly and ever-soslightly subversive, The Green Hornet is an irreverent comedy bound to annoy comic-book purists - usually a good sign - and sure to delight everyone else. Think this year's Kick-Ass.
15273	7	a	"Peter Jackson has formally moved away from the artistic act of directing, and into the business of creating synthetic movie ""product."" "
15274	4	a	The chemistry within the cast has survived the long separation, and although some of the reappearances don't exactly serve the story, they certainly contribute to the atmosphere.
15275	4	a	All in all, it's good natured, quirky fun of the kind Australian cinema does so well.
15276	4	a	Seems cheaply shot and perhaps that is why it just does not ring true.
15277	6	a	In the class of American boxing movies, it's barely a welterweight.
15278	4	a	Coffee and Cigarettes will attract fans of Jim Jarmusch's quirky film style and offbeat humor.
15279	4	a	Suffers from unconvincing plotting, and a third act so bad it brings the roof of the whole endeavour caving in
15280	9	a	Ultimately, its greatest shortcoming is that it's lazy, half-hearted button-pushing, more grimly tedious than gung-ho.
15281	3	a	Overall, the movie feels brighter, smarter and sleeker than the first.
15282	4	a	A sweet little film for anyone that enjoys blurring the lines between fantasy and reality. Climaxes strongly. Has moments of greatness and moments of not-so-greatness.
15283	9	a	Compared with the psychological probing and spiritual brooding of Batman Begins, Fantastic Four is proudly dumb, loud and inconsequential.
15284	10	a	Ineptly written, feebly acted, clumsily directed yawner of an adventure yarn.
15285	4	a	So what if the political satire is as thin as wax paper?...In the end, the gleeful action, absurd silliness and crude pleasures outweigh the film's weaknesses.
15286	3	a	succeeds at being simultaneously cerebral and primal
15287	1	a	"Though ""Three Billboards Outside of Ebbing, Missouri"" pursues a number of narrative strains, it's really about lost characters doing whatever they can to scheme their way out of a rut."
15288	4	a	Yet as obnoxiously convoluted and overwrought as everything is, somehow [director Julius] Onah manages to still present things in a way that's fascinating no matter how pointlessly bizarre much of what is transpiring undeniably is.
15289	3	a	The remarkably thin plot works primarily due to Auteuil's disarming charm.
15290	2	a	Manages to thoroughly entertain, evoking laughter and tears.
15291	8	a	As distressed as a comedy can be without qualifying as a snow emergency.
15292	3	a	...a fine adventure story with breathtaking cinematography of magnificent landscapes.
15293	1	a	Both Crudup and Sutherland deliver superb performances in the support of a thoughtful, committed, and richly visualized film.
15294	4	a	[It's] a mess, but if you're willing to pick through it, there's some gold amongst the dross.
15295	6	a	It's not terrible: It offers a handful of funny and touching moments and maintains a level of cuteness. But it's far from original, and its star chemistry doesn't exactly light up the screen.
15296	1	a	Wyler's superlative rendition of Henry James' novel Washington Square is meticulously mounted with great acting from Olivia De Havilland, Monty Clift, and particularly Ralph Richardson, dark-noirish lensing, and powerful score from Aaron Copeland.
15297	3	a	I think that's a big part of what makes Logan Lucky a very fun movie: You're lost, you're lost, you're lost -- and then it all makes so much sense that you feel like you should have known what was happening all along.
15298	0	a	Roger Moore's best performance as Bond. He's sterling in this one.
15299	2	a	It is a patchy film, haltingly paced, but the visual invention is astonishing.
15300	6	a	One very long, dark ride.
15301	3	a	Matchstick Men is so good when it is good that it's somewhere between exasperating and galling when it undermines our invested goodwill with a monster contrivance out of deep left field.
15302	2	a	The documentary film crew gets remarkable behind-the-scenes access to Valentino's fashion empire.
15303	5	a	It makes you wonder if this trip was really necessary.
15304	6	a	An exploration of the results such a situation could bring ... [T]hose results are admittedly predictable and formulaic.
15305	4	a	Fluffy, fun and all-round charming stuff.
15306	3	a	The Edge of Seventeen went beyond the edge of glory and created a new standard for coming of age films about being a teenager in high school.
15307	3	a	Within the context of modern family comedies and the vast enabling wasteland of tweener TV, these people feel almost three-dimensional.
15308	6	a	Its disparate elements never add up to approximating real life.
15309	9	a	The franchise is losing altitude fast.
15310	4	a	More than any recent comedy I can think of, Meet the Fockers seems likely to split audiences between those who find it deliriously funny and those who grind their teeth at its obviousness.
15311	2	a	Oddball existential western animation.
15312	2	a	Penn has a real feeling for the stray moments in life that suddenly rush up and overwhelm us with emotion. He also has an eye for beauty in the wilds, of which this film has many. And he's very good with actors.
15313	0	a	It's a film that justifies repeated viewing, each time a new detail underlining its resonant depiction of love as an adventure.
15314	1	a	confirms both Spielberg's mastery of cinematic thrills and the comparatively empty bombast of today's summer tentpole movies, even the better ones.
15315	5	a	The film relies heavily on Depp's performance, but it's so over-the-top that it's just not that entertaining.
15316	6	a	None of the characters interested me.
15317	2	a	It remains as one of the more entertaining pieces of cinema of the previous decade.
15318	1	a	A truly beautiful photographed film.
15319	1	a	Spielberg's tribute to the Holocaust reps Hollywood cinema at its best. Looking at the phenom from Schindler's narrow POV, the film is sharply-written and anchored by three great actors, Liam Neeson, Ben Kingsley and Ralph Fiennes.
15320	0	a	Fight Club is not a glorification of violence. It is a deconstruction.
15321	5	a	DeNiro is pretty much the only reason to see Meet the Fockers...[betrays] creative exhaustion.
15322	4	a	A slick, starry thriller that entertains for the full two-hour running time without threatening to do much more than that.
15323	6	a	The special effects for this film were pretty bad.
15324	3	a	"Embrace of the Serpent"" is film at its most ambitious and uncompromising."
15325	4	a	Not as bad as claimed, but not very good either.
15326	4	a	Many of the plot set-ups get plenty of laughs, but the movie feels like a series of contrivances.
15327	6	a	Like most of Apatow's work, Knocked Up walks a perilous line between sarcasm and sentimentality, and though it's extremely funny in bursts, the movie flirts once too often with schmaltz before toppling into melodrama in its third act.
15328	3	a	As with any big screen version of a comic book/TV series, the filmmakers up the stakes a great deal, providing not only more explosions and bigger set pieces, but also more atmosphere.
15329	4	a	McAbee has fashioned a film rich in ocular humor.
15330	3	a	Brilliantly directed and superbly written, this is a hugely entertaining drama with impeccable production design work, a fabulous soundtrack and note-perfect performances from a terrific ensemble cast.
15331	5	a	As soapy as it ever was.
15332	2	a	Restores some faith that there are some creative minds left in animated films that Pixar hasn't added to its talent pool.
15333	8	a	Filled with real characters, great pop culture references, foul-mouthed jokes and with a gooey sweetness right at the center, Knocked Up is a comedy classic.
15334	3	a	A movie that takes on sex, religion and race in the rural South. But the most enduring aspect of this film, written and directed by Craig Brewer, is its great compassion.
15335	2	a	A lightweight but sincere glimpse at starting life when many are ending it.
15336	1	a	The movie dazzles us into self-examination.
15337	0	a	What's striking now is how utterly modern it is in structure.
15338	4	a	An ingenious, G-rated claymation adventure.
15339	4	a	This is UPN-style storytelling and aesthetics trying to pass as serious filmmaking.
15340	0	a	It is a commanding performance from Hoffman, and an overwhelmingly satisfying note for this actor to end on.
15341	6	a	Siblings Jonathan and Christopher Nolan's adaptation of the novel by Christopher Priest offers three acts of exasperating muddle.
15342	3	a	With everyone having fun, both in front of and behind the camera, it's hard for a viewer not to find the whimsy contagious.
15343	4	a	Jindabyne loses its general sense of direction.
15344	2	a	A valuable look at an important slice of recent history.
15345	4	a	The setting is spectacular, but its ghosts underwhelm. Kudos to del Toro for bucking the minimalist trend in spooky movies, but his Grand Guignol spirits are so visible they begin to resemble fun-house monsters.
15346	3	a	In addition to being [Smith's] filthiest, this is his most free-associative movie. In spite of and because of its homemade look, it's also his funniest.
15347	4	a	Too many false endings and time issues aside, Hitch is difficult to discount when it handles the rom-com formula better than most of its insufferably dumbed-down ilk.
15348	10	a	It's almost like [Scott]'s trying as hard as he can to make the worst movie of all time.
15349	4	a	Vikander and Fassbender show these stresses well, and the idea of taking a baby for their own is a surprisingly dark but welcome addition to the well-trodden postwar melodrama narrative.
15350	6	a	To watch David O. Russell's zany farce is to see an alert mind at work, but the movie doesn't work. Huckabees is a distancing intellectual film with too small a heart.
15351	0	a	After two artistic flops, it appeared that filmmakers Joel and Ethan Coen had taken a fall. Not so. They're back with their twelfth and perhaps greatest film.
15352	5	a	Starts off simple, gets unnecessarily complicated, ties itself into further knots.
15353	3	a	It all makes for an interesting look at infamy in the hands of the brash young Cox.
15354	5	a	What drove the original was the clash of personalities, but here, when all you have is a just lot of sand, things get pretty dry pretty fast.
15355	3	a	The puppets are extremely impressive and the fact that the strings are constantly visible is used to brilliant comedic effect, particularly during one of the film's crudest scenes.
15356	4	a	Lehmann, far from the glory days of Heathers, has made a movie about a hard-on, in which he relentlessly pounds a flaccid premise.
15357	4	a	In spite of its strong performances and glossy production, The Soloist plays a tune youve heard too many times.
15358	1	a	Mix X-Men with True Lies and Spy Kids then add the retro design of The Powerpuff Girls all tied together with the magical technology of Pixar...
15359	5	a	It starts off strong but quickly becomes so contrived and repetitive that by the time it finally lumbers to its deeply unsatisfying and ludicrously melodramatic finale, you feel like an idiot for having wasted your time watching it
15360	6	a	Beautifully shot in high contrast black-and-white, Dead Man fails not because of any one particular flaw, but instead stumbles, caught in a quagmire of metaphysical constructs and Western lore.
15361	3	a	This digimated all-animal western borders on the inspired.
15362	6	a	Mendes and Deakins are so busy trying to be visionary that they don't notice that characters are wandering too far from their roots, and half the time you can't see what's going on.
15363	0	a	Humorous asides in no way interfere with the ability of this modern parable to drive home a sobering message about the sanctity of marriage. Faith-based entertainment at its best that you don't have to be Born Again to appreciate.
15364	3	a	Still a quirky, deadpan classic even if it isn't aging nearly as well as you'd hope. 
15365	5	a	Facing the Giants feels like an overly earnest church sketch of the type many evangelical congregations use as a teaching tool on Sunday between the worship music and pastor's message.
15366	6	a	For older children and adults, it's thin soup.
15367	0	a	'Get On Up' has Chadwick Boseman going for it, who is thoroughly convincing as the Godfather of Soul
15368	3	a	'The Hobbit' is another ambitious, gorgeous and faithful trip into JRR's writing - and because of this, it won't win any new fans if you had no patience ten years ago. For those who do, you'll definitely want to go there and back again.
15369	3	a	It may also even have the power to make you think twice the next time you run through the drive-thru at your local KFC.
15370	1	a	[Julianne Moore] delivers a brilliant performance that buoys Still Alice just when it seems too much to bear. Oscar is waiting in the wings.
15371	4	a	Sometimes flawed material can be saved by great performances and good intentions.
15372	1	a	A surreal, demented delight.
15373	3	a	A pulse-pounding piece of documentary reportage, and a terribly important account of a social problem in developing countries that won't be going away anytime soon.
15374	7	a	Had Paramount played more team ball, they coulda been a contender
15375	5	a	This surprise Netflix addition comes from a distinguished franchise, but like a paradox, no matter how hard you think about it, it will always be logically unacceptable.
15376	0	a	It's The Great Escape as performed by chickens and is every bit as good as you could imagine.
15377	2	a	A good night out for those who want something creepy that will stick with you for a while after seeing it.
15378	6	a	I Origins is a semi-bizarre mix of sci-fi, parable and romantic drama that, while frequently engaging, never really holds together.
15379	6	a	[T]he movie's sights are a surprising treat. The same cannot be said of the story...
15380	5	a	The story seems to offer more than it ever really delivers, and in the end we're not quite sold.
15381	3	a	Capraesque. Hitchcockian. Add Wootastic to the Lexicon.
15382	4	a	While not one of Cronenberg's stronger films, this anti-capitalist adaptation still merits attention.
15383	4	a	"The Sandlot is a movie with a comfortable working knowledge of the term ""family entertainment."
15384	4	a	It's engaging enough to keep us watching, but never finds any real focus.
15385	6	a	Director Brian Henson should have left brand expectations out of it and simply carried on in the vein of his father's excursions into fantasy.
15386	0	a	One of the sharpest and corrosively perceptive films to emerge from Hollywood.
15387	0	a	Amadeus is a must for any music lover, any film lover, or anyone who reveres excellence.
15388	2	a	Steven Spielberg's Jurassic Park first introduced me to what movie magic can be.
15389	1	a	[The characters], like us, are looking for answers in a rare movie that boldly and thoughtfully asks the right questions.
15390	1	a	a sweet and sometimes painfully honest portrait of the interrelationships among four largely internal characters
15391	3	a	Turns these animals' tales into triumphs of endurance and dynamite parenting, which does become difficult when you're low on food and weigh as much as a car.
15392	1	a	By adeptly combining action and ideas, it proves that Hollywood can still produce astonishing entertainment.
15393	0	a	One addictive picture which you won't be able to help but watch again and again
15394	7	a	A sloppy script from Craig Mazin shows no sense of character, and dragged-out direction from Seth Gordon shows no understanding of comic momentum. 
15395	2	a	A little slice of Southern Gothic is just what the back room doctor ordered in this summer of explodey superhero movies.
15396	6	a	"Many of Flowers' individual performances and scenes are striking and masterful, but taken as a whole, it's less a film than a rallying cry of ""Our people feel more deeply than yours."
15397	3	a	A first rate film with an outstanding cast...
15398	1	a	Continues the resurrection of Nicholas Cage's career.
15399	2	a	High-spirited, well-acted, and even a bit more substantive than I could have anticipated.
15400	9	a	So gross, brutal and just plain bad that I may never want to see another Jason Statham movie.
15401	3	a	It's not exactly scary but it made me so tense I could hardly breathe, let alone think.
15402	5	a	Even Smith needs good material, and it's fitfully supplied here.
15403	9	a	We know how she does it. The better question is: Why should we care?
15404	4	a	One of Kaurismaki's more pleasant and likeable films.
15405	3	a	Bridges is an admirable achievement, one that probably does more to reposition its maker as someone who can carry a movie without carrying a gun than as the director/star of a Love Story for the Loving Care set.
15406	3	a	Mystic falters occasionally, but I respect its effort and I'm happy to see Mr. Eastwood growing as a director.
15407	9	a	Dunmore slogs through the story with an overripe sense of gravity that, when mixed with the film's carefully botched look, makes for one murky moviegoing experience.
15408	3	a	"A comedy that delivers in every way, ""American Dreamz"" easily gets my vote."
15409	5	a	"By the time ""Taking Woodstock"" comes to an end, you may find yourself asking ""Was this long, strange trip really necessary?"
15410	5	a	A purported comedy that had me mentally following minor characters off screen, wondering if their lives might be more interesting than what was happening on it.
15411	0	a	It's no news that Murray is a creative comic actor, with films like Groundhog Day and Rushmore on his resume. Here he's at his very best.
15412	4	a	Schrader is the divine mortal who wrote Taxi Driver and Raging Bull. He's as passionate as ever; what he has lost is his discipline.
15413	1	a	Gritty and electrifying.
15414	5	a	Kevin Smith's weakest film, and a guilty pleasure among his fans, but a movie that I found to be very rhythmless and flat.
15415	2	a	Script-wise, there is nothing truly revelatory here, but the patient viewer will be rewarded by a film of unique awe and heart wrenching wonder. 
15416	5	a	Unfortunately, the movie around him is as flat and formulaic as a Washington pen-pusher.
15417	4	a	Paul Blart: Mall Cop is a tongue-planted-firmly-in-cheek force to be reckoned with.
15418	2	a	A great contraption of a film, The Prestige is a classy little maze of distractions, obsessions and showmanship, a magic trick of a movie that keeps the viewer mesmerized and then ends with a flourish.
15419	4	a	A tender, moderately satisfying essay on fate, the haves and have-nots of the world, parental responsibility, opportunism, and modern family dismemberment and values.
15420	4	a	Hancock is either a brilliant disaster or an often uneven masterwork.
15421	5	a	A little like modern country music - odd moments of sincerity, heart and authenticity peek through the plastic, the hype and the manufactured hokum.
15422	1	a	This is Bond like you've never seen him and a dynamite Daniel Craig, never better in the role, nails Bond's ferocity and feeling. Skyfall is smashing, just smashing.
15423	2	a	It's Amy Adams who lends the role a heart bigger than the frame can contain. I defy anyone to watch this movie and not fall hopelessly in love with her performance.
15424	2	a	...the sort of light, breezy entertainment that feels a lot more like George Roy Hill or Peter Bogdanovich than it does Ridley Scott.
15425	2	a	There must be a helluva lot of Mallrats fans out there, and I feel pretty confident in saying that they'll pretty much adore this new DVD edition.
15426	4	a	Chadwick Boseman's performance makes you forgive the obvious hiccups. 
15427	3	a	An overplotted, gimmicky presidential-assassination thriller, its interlocking pieces have to fit just so for it to stay coherent and ratchet up the tension.
15428	1	a	Instead of setting aside creativity to kneel before the Movie Machine Conformitybot, Greengrass jumped out from a dark corner and knocked the 'bot out with a bag of nickels.
15429	4	a	A movie that suggests that not just the chickens but the locust-monsters inevitably will come home to roost in a postbellum South -- a 'Heart of Dixie' -- haunted by its violent, bigoted past.
15430	9	a	Like watching someone else play a bad videogame.
15431	3	a	Spielberg's Worlds is filled with terrific scenes but ultimately, he draws the film to a predictable and utterly disappointing conclusion.
15432	1	a	Savage, sweeping, spectacular.
15433	4	a	The seventh Trek extravaganza emerges as a disappointment, slightly better than the inept Star Trek V but markedly inferior to Parts II and VI.
15434	1	a	War of the Worlds is an attack-of-the-aliens disaster film crafted with sinister technological grandeur -- a true popcorn apocalypse.
15435	4	a	Better than OK, but no Spirited Away.
15436	6	a	[A] film of sentimental perceptivity delivered by some of the most amiable and charismatic actors working today. Sad then that it is not a great film thanks to a series of critical miscalculations by its acclaimed writer/director.
15437	3	a	The script's lively, modern points of departure give it a few surprises.
15438	5	a	click to read the full review
15439	0	a	impossibly good
15440	5	a	Like Kevin Kline's ridiculously pretentious Harrison, the film fancies itself much more interesting than it is.
15441	5	a	What Depp can't help is the film's vulgar uselessness.
15442	5	a	"Have you heard of ""a comedy of manners?"" Well, the two-hour waste of talent How Do You Know is a comedy of over-cooked mannerisms."
15443	8	a	Mel Gibson as a chicken.
15444	4	a	Walker: Texas Ranger - The Early Years
15445	6	a	A throw-it-at-the-wall-and-see-if-it-sticks onslaught of potty jokes, puns, celebrity cameos, J-horror, and j-high sophistication and wit. You get laughs, but not nearly as many as you'd hoped.
15446	2	a	Streisand and especially Hoffman are a hoot.
15447	4	a	In the more eye-pleasing The Artist, the plot eventually comes too close to its inspiration, though its early moments were headed for mastery - and transformation - of style.
15448	3	a	A truly powerful portrait of community and lost innocence.
15449	3	a	Okay, I'm saying it: Javier Bardem is the next Robert De Niro.
15450	3	a	A terrific Saturday matinee for pretty much anyone.
15451	3	a	The exquisitely photographed landscapes pull you out of your living room and into the grandeur of the West.
15452	6	a	The kids will love it; parents will just have to put up with it. 
15453	1	a	As an homage to silent films, it works. As a cinematic narrative of classic quality, it falls short.
15454	4	a	Amistad is worth seeing for the stormy scenes on board the slave boat, and for Djimon Hounsou's magnetic performance. Otherwise, it can't decide on its direction, and this unique historical event is stifled into a less than thrilling courtroom drama.
15455	6	a	It's a marvel [Seth MacFarlane] hasn't torn a rotator cuff from patting himself on the back so much.
15456	4	a	Even if it's a bit too knowing in places for children and a bit lightweight in others for adults, as a whole it gives Pixar every chance to show that even with a moderate story line it can give us something to savour.
15457	3	a	Parker and Stone unleash the Jerry Bruckheimer id with the movie we all know Hollywood would seriously like to make...cannot be denied its humorous high points.
15458	6	a	Red Planet's lack of original ideas locks it into a decaying orbit.
15459	0	a	I've never seen a movie quite like Embrace of the Serpent.
15460	6	a	Some projects are just too misguided for the star to mug and shrug his way out of. Consider Rock the Kasbah at the top, or the bottom, of that list.
15461	9	a	Every time the performers insinuate some fresh response, the concepts close in on them. I began to dread even the funny bits, because I knew director Peter Billingsley would milk them to death.
15462	6	a	And the Oscar for Best Performance in Her Underwear goes to ... Christina Ricci, playing a pint-sized Jezebel who gets a spiritual wedgie from a half-crazed, blues-singing black man named Lazarus.
15463	4	a	Funny and heartwarming, if not entirely original, Bolt is bound to charm audiences of all ages.
15464	3	a	Despite some heartbreak in the last half, this film brims with humanity and some priceless humour, too.
15465	7	a	As I have said in the past, I have barely been able to contain my excitement in the recent avalanche of quality Disney fare. Not.
15466	6	a	Director Laurence Dunmore films everything through a corrosive brown fog, obscuring and muffling the film's life force.
15467	5	a	The Darkest Minds never communicates the overwhelming horror of a society whose children are either dead or in the process of being exterminated, or the hopelessness of kids discovering that every potential benefactor may have ulterior motives. 
15468	4	a	Jessica Chastain and Michael Greyeyes bring smarts and chemistry to this worthy Western.
15469	3	a	This is a tighter, smarter film than either 'Shaun of the Dead' or 'Hot Fuzz', and buried beneath all the blue-goo aliens and terrible punning is a heartfelt meditation on the perils and pleasures of nostalgia.
15470	5	a	Required viewing for the fan of pious filmmaking or the cinematographer in film school. From a story and character perspective, it's sadly very forgettable.
15471	5	a	This is a neo-minstral show.
15472	9	a	Much happens -- some of it incomprehensible, most of it pointlessly preposterous and all of it slightly less involving than watching algae grow on a stagnant pond.
15473	2	a	Whether conscious or not on the part of the filmmakers, the gory logic follows America's understandable desire to rationalize the effects of such physical violence that its invisible soldiers are suffering in Afghanistan and Iraq.
15474	3	a	The Thing Called Love charms and touches.
15475	0	a	It is one of the most profound and moving experiences that cinema has ever conveyed.
15476	2	a	It's not a pretty picture, but it is a funny one, if you agree with Tanovic that all human behavior tends toward folly, cowardice, self-deception, corruption and hopelessness.
15477	5	a	The tension never heightens to the point where you worry about the protagonists...
15478	6	a	...the feel of an old-school weeper...
15479	2	a	There's a casual, endearing familiarity to everything on display, but it never feels pandering or in service of a filmmaker's sense of nostalgia. 
15480	3	a	Jack Goes Boating doesn't exactly herald the arrival of a major new filmmaking talent, but it does act as a modestly entertaining showcase for a group of versatile performers.
15481	3	a	A brilliant pastiche on so many genres, it has no right to be as entertaining as it is, or as gripping.
15482	0	a	Right up there with the best of the revenge genre, and earns praise from this critic for its sophisticated brand of humor which kept me in stitches from start to finish.
15483	9	a	Structured around a series of blackouts and gross-outs, Silent Hill is one long free fall through icky surrealism and underlighted nightmares.
15484	3	a	Dialogue is witty and performances are first-rate. While it's Cumberbatch's show, Knightley is very good as a woman thrilled at being able to put her intelligence to use.
15485	3	a	a charming lesson on tolerance that should delight children and adults alike
15486	2	a	The Edge of Seventeen has more than enough earnestness of heart to make up for its structural shortcomings. It's a teen film with an uncommonly honest ear for interactions.
15487	9	a	The results are supposed to be funny, but are instead painful.
15488	7	a	Like a wasted appointment at a bad psychic's reading room. All the set dressing is there, but it leaves you with an empty, unsatisfied feeling inside.
15489	1	a	Trevorrow keeps the film moving with the crackerjack skill of a screwball comedy - almost nobody in the film is allowed to be uninteresting or unfunny. 
15490	5	a	A startling mishmash of tones - the goofy kid-approved levity in with upper-tier night terror imagery.
15491	2	a	Imaginative sci-fi tale with a metaphysical dimension.
15492	6	a	A moody, plodding film.
15493	0	a	Shame draws the rutted map of war's psychology, in bold and grievous strokes recognizable to any audience, and liable to frighten and humble them all.
15494	3	a	This rockumentary leaves Vertical Limit and Cliffhanger in the powder snow. The men's versions of the events are fascinating, often amusing and blatantly honest.
15495	3	a	Get ready for a more heated debate than any election season. Is Peter Jackson's ambitious, overblown adaptation worth it, or is it a flagrant attempt to create a cash cow out of a children's book? The answer is yes.
15496	6	a	This scenario is, as presented, so jarringly unreal that I gave up trying to follow the plot and settled back to enjoy the look of the film and some of the performances.
15497	1	a	It constantly keeps us off balance, even as it never loses its own.
15498	1	a	A stealthily engrossing work that should appeal to viewers who haven't seen, say, Affliction. 
15499	6	a	Has the integrity of a solid B-movie.
15500	4	a	Even when the film connects, I can't help feel that it's mostly because it's set the target too low.
15501	2	a	Marvel at its strangeness
15502	6	a	Self-conscious about its heroism with portrayals that lean toward the glib and the professionally uplifting, the film milks our sympathies too readily to be emotionally convincing.
15503	4	a	We witness the birth of a new genre, the Post-Slasher Movie.
15504	8	a	The Game attempts to exude menace through hardcore forehead-wrinkling and gangsta nose-crinkling, but his efforts are more comic than sinister.
15505	4	a	Josh Charles is reliably smarmy as well. If they ever do a Real Genius remake, that guy is your new Dr. Hathaway.
15506	1	a	Guillermo del Toro's gothic horror, haunted house shocker -- perhaps the most visually striking film of the year -- is in a class by itself. A rich and effective horror movie.
15507	3	a	A conventional but first-rate spy thriller.
15508	7	a	These sequences make it apparent that Story, despite his last name, would really rather just be shooting home movies of his attractive friends goofing around
15509	3	a	A Most Wanted Man is Hoffman's film. He doesn't just dominate the picture; he wears it like a scruffy but well-fitted suit. It's an honourable last bow.
15510	4	a	Secondhand Lions is not a great movie, but you'd have to be an old coot not to like it at least a bit.
15511	3	a	Robert Pattinson's most interesting performance by a mile.
15512	6	a	The film's lack of personality permeates all its aspects - from the TV movie-esque, affected child acting to the dullest Irish pub scenes ever filmed.
15513	3	a	The film affectionally spoofs animated-fantasy formulas.
15514	6	a	A movie that begins with high tension gradually fizzles out.
15515	2	a	Choose sequels with the return of an iconic cast, emotional depth, a humorous script, and visual eye candy from beginning to end.
15516	4	a	The film's attempts to flesh out Felt's personal life fall flat and the story has a bit of trouble sticking the landing. Regardless, it's a fascinating story with a surprisingly strong tie to what's currently happening in the U.S. government.
15517	2	a	Roman Coppola may never become the filmmaker his Dad was, but heck - few filmmakers will. But based on CQ, I'll certainly be keeping an eye out for his next project.
15518	3	a	In the film, Alexander Payne's overview of America is extraordinarily, multifariously profound.
15519	3	a	Hoffman, in particular, is a delight - he has an infectious comic energy that seems to light up the rest of the cast.
15520	4	a	Here's hoping this first romantic comedy won't be his last. Or the best.
15521	5	a	TV-trained writer-director Daniel Taplitz displays little imagination and almost no sense of comic timing.
15522	1	a	When Smith and Monaghan are interacting with Sonny the robot, you swear he's a real person who just happens to look a bit odd.
15523	3	a	Not all the gags work, not all the gross-outs serve the greater good, but How High is funny, quick, and the very definition of a pleasant surprise.
15524	1	a	The violence and coarseness of Three Billboards have a purpose. McDonagh is searching for the humanity, the nobility, within his characters, and thankfully, though the journey is brutal, eventually we find it along with him.
15525	3	a	This is patient filmmaking, trading sensationalism for the rewards of investigation.
15526	6	a	Non-action movie fans will enjoy it, patriots will enjoy it, and Harrison Ford fans will enjoy it
15527	2	a	If the equally naive Superman were released today, would it receive a similarly cold reception?
15528	7	a	It really wasn't that bad of a film, it was just too flat and preachy.
15529	1	a	As long as Almodovar keeps investing such thought and energy in his work, he can play with whatever themes he desires.
15530	4	a	Doom may not be a sure-fire hit, but it's certain to satisfy its target audience.
15531	4	a	See this in a cool theater on a hot summer day.
15532	6	a	Vantage Point requires three simultaneous coincidences for the ending to work. That may be a record.
15533	2	a	It's a free-for-all in comedy's gutter, a 'bad' movie that still manages to keep you giggling convulsively, even though you know you shouldn't.
15534	3	a	The script by Don Roos, who also directed, makes good use of the dramatic irony.
15535	5	a	Flounders about in a flux of narrative indecision and juvenile confusion.
15536	1	a	Casino Royale remains the best of the recent Bonds, with Skyfall just a notch below it.
15537	0	a	'Carol' is the most romantic movie of the year, and through Rooney Mara's performance-and Haynes' careful direction-it might also be the most cathartic.
15538	9	a	A gimmick in search of its own point.
15539	0	a	Effectively a Western in space, Serenity is a thoroughly entertaining, smartly written, beautifully acted, rip-roaring action-adventure movie, that will appeal to both Firefly fans and newcomers alike.
15540	4	a	As overlaong and pretentious as its title, The Assassination of Jesse James is worth a look almost in spite of itself.
15541	7	a	American Pastoral is a strong reminder that not every book is destined to be translated onto the big screen effectively.
15542	9	a	Translates your average bad teen comedy into a below-average adult romantic comedy.
15543	2	a	Andy Tennant, Will Smith and Kevin James have managed to deliver a decent comedy out of a one-note idea.
15544	3	a	A valentine to the soft-core lover in all of us, and proof that on some levels, Jane Fonda will never be taken seriously.
15545	5	a	Compared to Pixar's recent masterpiece Coco, so full of life, imagination and eccentricity, Early Man is middling, it's grey vs. technicolour.
15546	1	a	Matt Tyrnauer's sharp-eyed documentary Valentino: The Last Emperor follows the luxury-loving pooh-bah and his indispensable, since-forever lover and business partner, Giancarlo Giammetti, through a season of magical dresses and minor diva snits.
15547	4	a	Coffee and Cigarettes feels thin and slight at times.... But at its best, the movie achieves the charm and delight that underscores Jarmusch's best work
15548	3	a	Sam Mendes has done a magnificent job, creating both a relevant and timeless entry into the Bond canon, while deftly adding homages to the series' past.
15549	1	a	The movie flows gracefully along, unrushed but ever forward, like time itself. And New Orleans' lovely old neighborhoods and romantic ambiance form the ideal locale for a gently fantastical tale.
15550	3	a	A tour-de-force piece of filmmaking about the art of survival - and a cinematically-glorious throwback to the Gene Hackman era.
15551	6	a	The writing is unimaginative -- Tech says 'snap' more often than that elf from the cereal commercials.
15552	1	a	Beautifully, inventively constructed, and filled with rich performances that are perfectly calibrated to the offbeat tone [director David O.] Russell was going for.
15553	5	a	A too-long title is just the first problem for this too-long, misguided, so-called romantic comedy.
15554	3	a	Pays sweet tribute to the folk music of Appalachia.
15555	2	a	The performances are excellent and the result is an altogether sympathetic, if not entirely original film, from the latest member of a talented movie dynasty.
15556	9	a	It's harmless enough, but harmless garbage is still garbage.
15557	3	a	Although the movie takes us further into the actual process of industrial death at Auschwitz than any American movie has yet dared, The Grey Zone never stoops to sensation or melodrama.
15558	5	a	Mostly mediocre heist flick.
15559	4	a	You want explosions, expertly choreographed violence and implausible situations easily remedied by running up a wall and doing a back flip? Cradle delivers the goods.
15560	4	a	If you accept The Expendables for what it is -- Stallone having some simple, stupid fun -- you may be surprised to find yourself joining him.
15561	5	a	"Golly, is it too much to expect more character dimension than this from the director of ""Schindler's List""?"
15562	0	a	Enchanted is not a perfect movie ... But it is so thoroughly delightful when Adams is on screen you forgive its faults with a smile.
15563	3	a	It's breathtaking, heartbreaking, tragic, gorgeous, and true all at the same time.
15564	6	a	Early Man is wanting: of a cleverer narrative, of memorable characters. It's not bad, necessarily. It just feels like an early draft of a better movie to come.
15565	3	a	For entertainment value, there's nothing this week to rival Bolt. It's a clever, funny family film.
15566	5	a	Van Sant's ... adoration of uncommunicative kids with limited vocabularies and awesome hair is beginning to wear a little thin.
15567	1	a	Lost in Translation's artful blend of romance and cross-cultural comedy is just the tonic for audiences weary of big, dumb, loud summer blockbusters.
15568	3	a	A lacerating portrait of an abused, impoverished youth drawn to a life of crime and violence...startlingly fresh and deeply moving.
15569	3	a	Risks dullness and embraces preachiness to pursue an idea that is given lip service by politicians but is rarely addressed in motion pictures: 'How do we inspire ourselves to greatness?'
15570	2	a	You may not realize until you're watching The To Do List how refreshing it is just to see this familiar story told from the female perspective. 
15571	3	a	Expecting Tina Fey to bash the War on Terror and a certain president in Whiskey Tango Foxtrot? Think again.
15572	5	a	Below average mystery. Slow and uninvolving. Thurman nude scene is body double.
15573	3	a	Liam Neeson is excellent. Regardless of whether he accurately embodies the real Mark Felt, he fulfills the role we expect from Deep Throat - a crusader who won't back down.
15574	0	a	One of the few legitimate offshoots of David Lynch.
15575	6	a	Exotic locations and vibrant colors mask what is essentially a Japanese soap opera voiced in English...
15576	5	a	Too often, the viewer isn't reacting to humor so much as they are wincing back in repugnance.
15577	7	a	The film's disregard for basic plot lucidity either stems from contempt for its audience, or from post-production decisions aimed at making something, anything, out of nothing
15578	5	a	This strategy is wrong at every level. It renders the images nauseating, it constantly rejects you emotionally from the performances, and it's showy and distracting. Worst, it turns the real issue of post-traumatic stress into a technological gimmick.
15579	4	a	The best way to combat a lackluster script is good casting, and Diane Lane, John Cusack and Christopher Plummer are quite the foot soldiers in Must Love Dogs.
15580	6	a	It does almost everything well, from the direction to the performances. But it does nothing great, dragged down by an uninspired, and oddly uninspiring, script.
15581	5	a	The film is let down by a script that could never draw out its characters and make its predictable story build to anything more than what's anticipated.
15582	5	a	Ranges from bad sci-fi to stereotypical B-horror to British TV-like drama to Child's Play-like slasher to... just plain weird
15583	3	a	Sometimes talented filmmakers can pep up even the most hackneyed material with an infusion of energy and talent.
15584	0	a	With a sense of swagger and an unflinching pace, Carnage Park is truly a cinematic triumph from top to bottom.
15585	5	a	It's not a good movie despite its stylishness and performances, but it does have a short window of appeal for reasons entirely independent of its plausibility.
15586	9	a	If you're going to make a cheesy psycho-killer thriller, just go ahead and embrace the Roquefort. Pretending it's anything else is only annoying.
15587	2	a	It's very, very interesting but it's sort of like you've got to have that magic combination: you've got to have looks and heart.
15588	4	a	It's a fairly uninspired screenplay. And the same can be said for both the Boleyn girls. They are both extremely fetching in their tight bodices but unengaging as characters.
15589	6	a	A labor of conviction that comes remarkably close to faith-based sadism.
15590	3	a	The Curious Case Of Benjamin Button is not just a technical marvel, it is an epic piece of storytelling with an incredible attention to detail.
15591	3	a	For beautiful, intimate moments, few films at Cannes this year were in the same league as The Rider. 
15592	8	a	This wannabe epic is forgettable, bland and way too long.
15593	0	a	Sorrentino's juxtaposition of contemporary Roman indulgence and the Eternal City's place in history's imagination makes for a bittersweet epic in which a solitary character, Jep, stands in for the director, and us, and experiences an epiphany.
15594	4	a	Inspirational, laden with tough love, and on occasion a tad hokey. Stand and Deliver on the basketball court.
15595	4	a	After a Disappointing Summer, This is Good B-Movie Pulp Fiction.
15596	4	a	It's a mixture of the military/industrial complex paranoia of The X-Files, the deadpan style of Sam Spade and the wisdom of Confucius-lite.
15597	9	a	Max Payne. Epic Fail.
15598	0	a	Joel and Ethan Coen have a great catalog of films behind them, but they paint their masterpiece with No Country For Old Men.
15599	5	a	A dulling experience. The movie screams been there, done that and offers nothing new to the table.
15600	3	a	A sun-baked symphony of rust and dust, Rango has a spiky, unsentimental appeal, sending out slightly risque jokes to parents while staying safely out of the danger zone for kids.
15601	3	a	A biopic that plays out like a cerebral thriller, this film traces the life of Alan Turing, the British maths genius who essentially invented the computer and won World War II before being driven to suicide by a cruel legal system. 
15602	1	a	The funniest, smartest American comedy in years. It's destined to become a cult classic.
15603	5	a	Though some, including the filmmakers, might find this sort of material smart and real, others might consider it middlebrow and not particularly representative of the complex and interesting people they know, some of whom are even men.
15604	4	a	Director Todd Graff does have a keen understanding of kids in the world of performing arts, as he shows here and in his earlier and better film Camp.
15605	3	a	Leave your sense of reason at the door and surrender yourself to the oo-la-laughs.
15606	4	a	An occasion when style really does triumph over substance.
15607	3	a	... before labeling this as just another chick flick, keep in mind that it's a whole lot more enjoyable than most of the current pre-summer blockbuster-wannabes that studios are unloading right now.
15608	6	a	Flashes of color and streaks of movement can make for a striking picture, but only if you can see what's taking place, not to mention if you care about who is in jeopardy.
15609	5	a	The narrative miscalculation is extraordinary and ruinous to the extent that I can't conjure an example of a similarly enjoyable movie being beheaded so efficiently.
15610	2	a	Almodovar has a keen eye with the camera, and this helps keep us interested. His love of coincidence also creates some moments of the unexpected.
15611	4	a	The end result, however, is a skewed picture that manages to promote Hollywood-style derring-do and make fascism look more stylish and profound than it has done in years.
15612	1	a	Eminem summons things from deep inside himself to shed away ego and portray a calm, frustrated, worried kid who doesn't even talk too much.
15613	3	a	[Chadwick] Boseman captures the volatility, on and offstage, of the entity we recognize as James Brown, the flamboyance, the fierce ambition, and the uncompromising determination to be treated with respect.
15614	3	a	A smart, arch and rather cold-blooded comedy.
15615	4	a	It's safe to assume its sharp comments on what kids can do to marriage - and friendships - come from years of observation.
15616	9	a	Scarcely even feature length, and bewilderingly chaotic.
15617	1	a	'Pollice sursum.' Thumbs up.
15618	6	a	The quirky potential of Herek's background and Jolie's charismatic persona ought to have been shaped into something more interesting than such pseudo-profound fluff.
15619	6	a	Foregoing substantial character development for a lot of back-and-forth squabbling between people who can't make up their minds, the film is often frustrating in its dumbed-down repetitiveness.
15620	2	a	An honest, warts and all portrait of a woman so driven to inform readers of the mad violence in the world that it cost her her own life.
15621	4	a	Colorful super spectacle suffers from script, pacing.
15622	4	a	The biggest, grandest dinosaur movie ever.
15623	5	a	The strain of messianism in Will Smith movies is becoming ever more pronounced.
15624	3	a	McQueen and Edward G. Robinson are aces.
15625	3	a	Franco's stories, sometimes coarse and flimsy on the page, operate like launch pads for a slew of fresh, frisky performers. But the delicacy of the movie's narrative and its almost mystical thread of yearning come from Coppola.
15626	3	a	...a fleet, quirky, computer-animated feature that I found ingenious, charming and almost entirely engaging.
15627	3	a	A beautifully animated romp through the world of Pooh as created by A.A. Milne.
15628	4	a	Overcomes its sloppy set-up to be light, enjoyable entertainment.
15629	4	a	What's not to enjoy?
15630	4	a	The movie we see here, though admirable in parts, is numbing as a whole.
15631	2	a	An offbeat melodramatic Western with added comedy that makes the villain a more arresting subject than the hero.
15632	3	a	A thinking person's action picture ... it is definitely one of this summer's better blockbusters.
15633	9	a	Packing it to the gills with character actors may give it a modicum of gravitas, but it doesn't do anything to buoy Landesman's poorly-executed script which sinks like lead.
15634	3	a	[Three Billboards] is a startling piece of work: a perverse, comic and tragic revenge story in which all the characters defy our often very low expectations of them. 
15635	6	a	Too precariously straddles the line between fun and cheese, often going a bit too far over the top.
15636	4	a	In the end there may not quite be enough here to make the film a classic, but it's enjoyable and lively and warm while it lasts.
15637	1	a	Its sleazy, scuzzy nature comes not from a forward desire to push the standards of taste but a been-there sense of the ways of the world.
15638	6	a	Unfortunately - much like Afghanistan and the war itself - as soon as the camera pans away, everything else is all but forgotten.
15639	4	a	I'm embarrassed to admit it, but I liked this movie. The Coreys were actually funny in this one.
15640	3	a	The film births wonderful performances from all three lead actors, as well as Marcia Gay Harden, who's palpable in preternatural ways, Thomas Guiry as the boy in love with Jimmy's daughter, and virtually everyone else with a strip of film time.
15641	9	a	It's not worth the quality time you could be spending with your children or the extra change in your wallet.
15642	3	a	A dandy paranoid thriller that begins confusingly but gets swifter and leaner as it goes.
15643	3	a	[A] stirring and remarkable true story.
15644	4	a	MacFarlane knows how to strike a healthy balance between juvenile humor and using his characters to express some of his passionate personal beliefs
15645	5	a	Jokes come thick and fast in a film that plays to the cheap seats but may bewilder the younger viewers at whom it's presumably aimed.
15646	4	a	Land of the Dead is second-rate Romero, which means it's far better than most horror films being made today
15647	1	a	"As directed by Clint Eastwood, ""Invictus"" is an inspirational story about fortitude, spirit and reconciliation."
15648	9	a	Animated alien entertainment exclusively for those who've already had their brains sucked out.
15649	5	a	For a movie about an immortal bald man killing witches in modern day New York, it still feels far too bland.
15650	3	a	Astute character studies are the point here, rather than a neat and tidy story.
15651	4	a	Yet another example of writer/director Klapisch's way of finding fresh new insights within the most mundane of circumstances.
15652	6	a	I generally don't like my action movies so action-free.
15653	8	a	This was a humorless film about tiresome characters who kept getting more annoying the more serious they became.
15654	6	a	Playing up the socio-religious rifts of the first film, the sequel reflects the country's current political schisms.
15655	4	a	Getting past the passages of forced teen coolness, this likable sci-fi romp brings some PG-tastic fun.
15656	6	a	Turns out there is something more annoying than an infatuated bunch of Star Wars nerds. Turns out a movie about an infatuated bunch of Star Wars nerds can really set your teeth on edge.
15657	1	a	Ooh, boy, this movie's got the funk AND the soul.
15658	3	a	Eastwood seems to have become M. Night Shyamalan. It's a good thing, since Shyamalan has been doing such a lousy job of it.
15659	3	a	[Chan] still can turn a silly little action comedy like this into a high-spirited, butt-kicking good time.
15660	3	a	Bright Star deals with the sonnets and the bonnets - top marks to the production and costume designer, Janet Patterson - with wit and restraint, and proves that a chaste romance needn't lack for passion, or poetry.
15661	4	a	A charming, touching and funny film, which sits near the top end of the rom-com world.
15662	3	a	While it's not in a league with Blade Runner, The Terminator or even Robocop, I, Robot is an efficiently designed, well-oiled machine.
15663	5	a	Although the movie offers a few chuckles here and there, it fails on almost every level.
15664	3	a	While it's not as frightening as other del Toro offerings, there's no escaping the constant anticipation of having the pants scared off you. It lurks around every atmospheric corner.
15665	2	a	As cinema, Selma is commendable; as cultural barometer, it's beyond reproach.
15666	3	a	Serenity is another superior, smart genre item.
15667	5	a	Mark Felt is a lacklustre staging of a fascinating episode in recent US history. Despite Neeson's strong presence, this is a deep throat that never finds its voice.
15668	6	a	"It held my attention, which is more than I can say for some of the so-called ""art films"" that come out at the end of every year."
15669	4	a	It's this career-best turn from Cumberbatch which helps to raise the game of this highly entertaining but technically functional British biopic.
15670	4	a	"Sister"" ... broods on the past, on how it defines the present and future, but as a film about remembering it is not especially memorable."
15671	3	a	If not for the amazing performance of Burt Lancaster, the film would collapse under its own self-righteousness.
15672	1	a	Josh Mond's debut film is the indie find of the year, filled with scenes that hit like a shot in the heart. Cynthia Nixon digs so deep into her character that you can feel her nerve endings. 
15673	5	a	"Django Unchained"" already recently nailed it. By contrast, ""A Million Ways to Die in the West"" is an attempted copycat -- messily comprised of some comedic hits but more misses -- that we just didn't need."
15674	1	a	An insta-classic piece of filmmaking, perfectly capturing the spirit and personality of the original yet somehow making you feel engaged and interested in a follow-up that, let's face it, you likely didn't have the need to see.
15675	3	a	A heart-warmer to make a cynic grin.
15676	4	a	Mendes is careful to keep the mood largely sombre ahead of a gruesome denouement which, visceral as it is, doesn't alter the pattern of the film; delivering more food for thought than fire in the belly.
15677	5	a	Crossover has too much going for it. It has a wonderful message about making smart life choices, but the story shuffles among too many subjects -- sports, romance, friendship -- to let audiences hear it clearly.
15678	4	a	Zalla gets very good performances from his mostly inexperienced actors.... The trouble is that the film is so bleak as to be almost hopeless.
15679	6	a	Might be enough to give viewers some vicarious thrills, but it's a little disconcerting for me to see Hannibal Lecter becoming less dimensional with each new movie.
15680	3	a	I changed my mind about this movie three times.
15681	6	a	It's too bad that Ms. Feste didn't ditch the female victim bit and make a movie about a survivor.
15682	1	a	Life as a blanket: He's you and you're me and we're both Bob Newhart in this brilliant comic romp. 
15683	4	a	There's just enough novelty, action and comedy in the tank to see this film teeter across the finish line, even if it does cough and splutter for much of the journey.
15684	9	a	A big, noisy headache of a movie...
15685	8	a	Even the normally reliable Kudrow can barely disguise her contempt for the material.
15686	3	a	Compelling drama takes on big life questions.
15687	4	a	The film works best when the two [leads] are having talks together with Murray playing it quiet and sincere. Sadly there are fewer of such moments than the film needed.
15688	4	a	It misses the opportunity to examine why a community of people - each of whom has already given up on life - would band together to form a new society of desperate misfits.
15689	7	a	This is juicy stuff, but the filmmakers have absolutely no idea what to do with it.
15690	5	a	There's a certain laudable doggedness in its creation, I guess
15691	9	a	so superficial and poorly directed that I've got to think that even those inclined to appreciate a gangsta-flavored action flick will be shaking their heads in disappointment.
15692	1	a	"To Live"" is a simple title, but it conceals a universe."
15693	4	a	Not only are there not enough good, smart roles for women, the movies that do contain those roles are too often one-dimensional.
15694	9	a	This franchise ran out of steam halfway through the credit crawl on the first movie, and there's been nothing but garbage-in-garbage-out since then.
15695	0	a	The Nightmare Before Christmas cleverly refashions its yuletide characters into Edward Gorey refugees.
15696	8	a	Laughable in a lumbering and boring way.
15697	1	a	Overlooking a disappointing conclusion, War of the Worlds is a marvelous entertainment of imagination, edge-of-your-seat suspense, and surprising thoughtfulness.
15698	1	a	"While ""Skyfall"" obviously has a great fondness for the past, it's not trapped there. It also anticipates Bond's future. In this immensely satisfying movie, so do we."
15699	10	a	The dialogue by Curtis-Hall and Darin Scott is a degrading string of profanities and inanities, interspersed with sadism and exploitation of women. Their opinion of their target audience should depress moviegoers of any color.
15700	3	a	Depp gives a smart, subtle performance, and Turturro is terrific as a foe who's both exactly what he seems and exactly the opposite.
15701	3	a	Director Tamara Jenkins focuses on the largely unexplored relationship between brothers and sisters, and she does so beautifully, thanks to the extraordinary talents of Hoffman and Linney.
15702	6	a	While most animated features, even the bad ones, champion individuality, Bee Movie flies in the opposite direction by rallying around the notions of conformity and subservience.
15703	6	a	A high-end Lifetime production.
15704	3	a	Good performances all around, especially from Zellweger and Kinnear. Lots of good laughs laced with nastiness.
15705	5	a	If you pitch your expectations at an all time low, you could do worse than this oddly cheerful -- but not particularly funny -- body-switching farce.
15706	1	a	The Bridges of Madison County is a beautiful film, not only in the way it was photographed, but for the manner through which the characters are revealed to us.
15707	2	a	Harmless fun for the dating crowd.
15708	3	a	Alpha Dog is a commanding ensemble piece.
15709	3	a	This is the film that the American Godzilla could have been, but wasn't.
15710	2	a	It's a chilling tale that leaves us with the fear that Latin America's exploding social problems may well be beyond solution.
15711	1	a	Provokes thought and provides joy in equal measure.
15712	3	a	Possibly the most suspense-charged mountain-climbing movie ever made.
15713	9	a	An accidental comedy trapped in sci-fi/action garb, like those actors swathed in their medieval tunics, stumbling and lurching along.
15714	6	a	...a mildly entertaining, visually well-crafted animation that can wait for rental.
15715	1	a	This is a subject that must never be forgotten or glossed over. A film such as The Grey Zone serves both art and history in helping to ensure that will never happen.
15716	1	a	a twisted masterpiece of self-parody
15717	7	a	Simply casting too wide a net to feel truly satisfying. In trying to be color blind, it just comes off as tone deaf.
15718	3	a	Nurse Betty suffers, however, from a script that relies on jaded hit men for comic impact. We've seen it done too many times since...Pulp Fiction.
15719	6	a	"As always, the action combines buff bods, sculpted sheet metal, testosterone, guns, bone-crushing throwdowns, tattoos, revving engines and a ""Transformers""-like delight in having as many things as possible smash into each other"
15720	6	a	Neither Jolie nor Burns bring much to their roles, and their chemistry together is nearly non-existent.
15721	1	a	It's a prickly little gem of a film.
15722	3	a	It Comes at Night is emotional, haunting dystopian horror that will leave you shaken.
15723	4	a	Muriel's Wedding is still a solid and entertaining movie. Just understand what you're getting in to.
15724	6	a	Although We Have a Pope is a heady concoction, it may not have mass appeal. It is blessed with a memorable performance by Michel Piccoli as the bewildered, overwhelmed cleric. But Nanni Moretti's direction at times seems as random as Melville's journey.
15725	6	a	Affleck and Paltrow seem to be enjoying their roles far more than we do.
15726	3	a	A movie with a preposterous plot, exotic locations, absurd action sequences, and so much chemistry between attractive actors that we don't care.
15727	6	a	It's cutesy enough to serve as a pleasant time-waster for those hungering for blue-collar romance in Chi town.
15728	0	a	... remarkable for how it turns literature into pure cinema, all emotion and image and heady sensation.
15729	6	a	Failure to Launch shoots itself in the foot by refusing to take its premise seriously. The very thing that seems most interesting is the same thing that the film goes out of its way to avoid dealing with.
15730	5	a	A proficient enough by-the-numbers nail-biter, but it certainly doesn't scale any cinematic heights.
15731	4	a	Sassy, snappy two-hour spin-off from the original cult favorite.
15732	3	a	While the narrative occasionally falters, The Soloist wisely avoids the pitfalls of the inspirational biopic by not tidily sewing things up. Instead, it presents a moving tribute to friendship and the power of music.
15733	10	a	From Dusk Till Dawn will be a real disappointment for most Tarantino fans.
15734	0	a	A masterpiece of epic proportions. Nothing captures all the different sides of the terror of the Holocaust as well as this gripping story.
15735	0	a	This is about as full a cinematic meal as it gets.
15736	5	a	Mercifully fleet and lamentably uninteresting...
15737	0	a	Accompanied by a sleepy music score from composer Mark Orton, Nebraska is another wonderful feature film from director Alexander Payne.
15738	3	a	Existential howl of despair meets stoner belly laugh in the latest project from Rogen and collaborators, who follow 'This Is the End' with another high-concept comedy that, like a horror movie, reduces its characters to meat.
15739	4	a	Foster's acting packs a punch but her 'Flight' is grounded by one too many coincidences.
15740	10	a	Julia's late career seems an apologia for buying someone else's husband and getting away with it, for the most part, in the court of public opinion.
15741	6	a	...an agreeable yet hopelessly forgettable little romcom.
15742	1	a	Nothing about this witty, inventive film obeys the rules.
15743	5	a	Uninspired sitcom about a man visiting home to a family that disrespected him as a youth.
15744	5	a	"Dull and unmoving, Hereafter offers little more than cop out resolutions to its supernatural themes, and a lack of testicular fortitude in its refusal to utter the words ""Heaven"" or ""God""."
15745	0	a	Andrew Dominik has taken the familiar story and reconstructed it is such a fascinatingly abstract manner that it feels as if we are watching it unfold before our eyes for the very first time.
15746	3	a	An incendiary, psychotic film surely guaranteed to polarize both critics and audiences alike
15747	1	a	An animated walk on the dry side
15748	3	a	Fair and factual, John Curran's film showcases a living, breathing performance from Jason Clarke as the Massachusetts Senator many say got away with murder.
15749	8	a	Delivers just about every bit of all-around entertainment I could ask for from a movie about chickens escaping from the farm.
15750	4	a	. . . pretty enjoyable if you look at it as the B-movie it really ought to be, rather than the E-ticket major studio release it actually is.
15751	3	a	An inarguably powerful film
15752	5	a	Whitaker's performance is one of only a few positives, as a film that ends on such an illusory, elaborate and downright absurd finale.
15753	6	a	Less of the domestic squabbling could have made Hitchcock a movie worthy of its namesake.
15754	5	a	Quite frankly this was not the movie for me, and while I'm not familiar with the source material I have trouble believing the legions of pint-sized fans that adore it are going to be happy with how their favorite tomes have been adapted.
15755	2	a	Giggling at the absurdities and inconsistencies is part of the fun. But the talented cast alone will keep you watching, as will the fight scenes.
15756	0	a	Cumberbatch's Aspergian odd man out is this film's greatest asset. Knightley is delightful.
15757	3	a	The screenplay walks a tightrope, managing to stay amusing and lighthearted while handling hefty themes.
15758	0	a	"Three Billboards Outside of Ebbing, Missouri,"" a tragicomic juggling act packed with vivid characters doing bad things at considerable moral cost, plays like a scalpel-sharp game of Catch the Sociopath."
15759	2	a	In its best moments, it gently shows us how Bolt's discoveries parallel those of a child in learning self-reliance.
15760	7	a	Tough going in spite of its obvious desire to please.
15761	0	a	It's a harsh, terrible story of a rite of passage, a boy's love and a journey to hell, and it's so brilliantly told that we feel the cold above and the all-consuming flames beneath.
15762	4	a	You certainly can't say this over-the-top thriller skimps on action. The final third or so is wall-to-wall brawling, shootings and explosions.
15763	9	a	"Failing almost entirely at amusement, ""The Road Chip"" may be most useful as a lesson for children to be more discerning about their movie choices."
15764	1	a	Harrowing, visually striking, and almost too on the nose for the current sociopolitical moment, It Comes at Night is one of the best films of the year.
15765	3	a	Like kids being told a new but familiar fairy tale, we can sit back and enjoy the telling.
15766	9	a	This is a movie that starts out like Heathers, then becomes Bring it On, then becomes unwatchable.
15767	9	a	A lot of Crossover's manifest failings could be forgiven if the on-court action was thrilling. But Space Jam had better basketball scenes. For that matter, so did Dr. J's The Fish That Saved Pittsburgh.
15768	1	a	Curiously tense throughout despite a paucity of physical action.
15769	6	a	Hits all the marks you expect, but with few surprises and a protagonist that doesn't inspire empathy, Bleed for This doesn't go very far.
15770	5	a	Nobbs is such a spectral presence that infusing any measure of life into this person is an insurmountable challenge.
15771	0	a	When it comes to animation, it doesn't get any better than this.
15772	6	a	The information sorting and gathering required by Barry L. Levy's screenplay feels like night school as opposed to a great night out at the movies.
15773	3	a	An intelligent examination of sexuality and relationships.
15774	3	a	Good, eeevil fun for everyone.
15775	3	a	It captures the tense flavor of a particularly heady time in Saint Laurent's life, during which he struggled with addiction and illness and juggled relationships ...
15776	5	a	"Early on, a character remarks that ""Wit is the most treacherous talent of all"" and based on the evidence contained within, the minds behind ""Becoming Jane"" are among the least treacherous people that you are likely to meet."
15777	10	a	What's great about this hideous, soul-scarring, brain-melting film is that it teaches children that to win at a competition... you must play as dirty as the other team.
15778	0	a	The story is extremely powerful. This is a very depressing film, but also very well crafted.
15779	4	a	This isn't great Altman but it's fun Altman.
15780	5	a	Many other critics have praised it, but I find it hard to enjoy a film so offensive. Be sure to keep kids away.
15781	0	a	Go ahead. Soak up the Beauty. It's one of the best films of the year.
15782	4	a	To put it most bluntly, the thing is just too long and too slow.
15783	4	a	A bone-headed farce that embraces its banality with sheer jubilation. Farley and Spade bring their inspired and nutty SNL antics to frenzied form.
15784	3	a	Cameron proves himself modest here, finding an unexpectedly low-key approach to a monumental subject.
15785	3	a	"We get an effective combination of raw, in-your-face direction - Friedkin has a ""two takes only"" rule - and a finely honed script."
15786	5	a	These are indeed moms, and they do have dinner, but the 'fun' part is in short supply.
15787	9	a	What do you do with a crummy horror movie that has been sitting on the shelf for a couple, or maybe three, years?
15788	1	a	"The To Do List"" doesn't reinvent the wheel; we all know the ""summer that changed everything"" trope. But it's startling when you realize how rare it is to see a girl chasing sexual experience so doggedly - and with such a lighthearted tone."
15789	3	a	A deeply felt, moving and genuinely tragic study of a marriage tearing itself apart.
15790	6	a	Couples Retreat is like watching somebody's boring vacation videos, except that they're filled with big stars.
15791	5	a	A Private War ultimately sides with the late journalist's assertion that the whos and whys of war matter far less in journalism than finding the right human-interest angle to hook an audience.
15792	3	a	A slam-dunk for Julia Roberts.
15793	5	a	Whoever said 'blondes have more fun' may have been right, but that doesn't mean we have to PAY to watch it happen in such trivial fashion.
15794	6	a	Recounts the true story of Chinese ballet star Li Cunxin's defection to the US in the schmaltziest TV-movie terms imaginable.
15795	0	a	Despite the undeniable merits of Jackson's other works, Heavenly Creatures strikes me as the best film he has made.
15796	2	a	...Guy Pearce is fabulous as Warhol, delivering a complex portrait of the pop artist as a bundle of contradictions.
15797	3	a	Pooh's Heffalump Movie is a charmingly sweet experience for very young moviegoers that also may make their parents smile.
15798	3	a	[F]or those drawn to cinema from diverse origins, wishing to learn more about other cultures, Ixcanul is a delicious, strong brew.
15799	1	a	Treats the ensuing issues of conscience and compromise with subtlety and warmth.
15800	3	a	[Coppola] shoots, with Girlhood DP Crystel Fournier, in sumptuous glossy-magazine-spread fashion, the effect of which ought to impel the most abstemious moviegoer to dash to the nearest bistro immediately upon leaving the theatre.
15801	8	a	I found this to be one of Clint Eastwood's worst films. I thought the emotion was very fake.
15802	5	a	I'm not really sure what the point of the movie is beyond giving Alma her rightful place in film history and putting her over-praised hubby back in his place - if what the picture depicts is true.
15803	4	a	Universal should have left well enough alone, heeding the immortal closing words of Farmer Hoggett in the original.
15804	3	a	...an exercise in pure entertainment.
15805	4	a	In all the gargantuousness, however there are redeemable moments, especially in Ford's oddly scaled Civil War episode.
15806	7	a	It's hamhandedly squeezed through the Hollywood rom-com template, resulting in a movie as moribund as the relationship it portrays.
15807	0	a	For my money, this is the best of Allen's films in which he does not himself appear
15808	3	a	Even while tackling sensitive issues such as alcoholism, bullying, and the consequences of nonconformity, Pegg and Wright never take themselves or their characters too seriously.
15809	4	a	Tim Story's screen adaptation of the Marvel comic is cheesy in production values; it's the clash of personalities that makes the film in any way fantastic.
15810	9	a	Consider the code cracked, translated, and laid out for all to see: different is special is good, and ordinary morality is a sham, anyway.
15811	4	a	Still, the stylistic games reflect Yi and her generation's larger dilemma. Paper Heart is a movie that can't commit about people who don't know how to.
15812	3	a	This is a heartfelt and smart-tongued micro sci-fi with a tone and voice entirely its own, faltering only in its half-hearted attempts to become an ensemble piece.
15813	5	a	What should have been a tense political thrilling blockbuster, ends up a wasted effort with a limp storyline that once again fails to give the book justice.
15814	1	a	A sweet and loving film where the characters are less mindful of an outside response and more consumed by the amorous temptations they possess.
15815	4	a	Who did it is less important to Ozon than a lampooning of the Sirkian aesthetic of pure artifice, but there's too much irony in the air for him to spin anything but the most brittle of confections.
15816	6	a	While the majority of this experience is a treat to observe, the abysmal conclusion is an unforgivable sin. 
15817	3	a	A sprawling story that benefits from Eastwood's stripped-down approach. There are no jive talking Tarantino exchanges here, and no crowd-pleasing pyrotechnics.
15818	6	a	The laughs are supposed to come from the mix-ups ... but this stuff is so attenuated and idiotic, it makes even less sense than is the norm for such flyweight workouts.
15819	5	a	Another indie director more interested in style than substance.
15820	3	a	Director Jeffrey Levy-Hinte does a terrific job re-creating a landmark moment, with behind-the-scenes footage complementing triumphant performances.
15821	1	a	Unexpectedly warm and huggable, and far funnier than you'd ever guess... one of the wittiest, most endearing holiday films in recent memory.
15822	6	a	Little more than a feature-length screen test for TV icon Ray Romano.
15823	1	a	It's a piercing glimpse of a young man's bright, confounding first love, the kind of love that brings disorientation and rhapsody.
15824	6	a	Content to offer an endless string of mistaken identities and contrived misunderstandings in the vein of a failed TV sitcom spinoff like The Ropers.
15825	2	a	The feature-length film, modelled on Pixar films, merges the best of western and eastern animation styles. result is an entertaining film that should satisfy both adults and children.
15826	2	a	A particularly energetic, jaunty Bond adventure, the kind that is just plain fun to watch, in a perfectly relaxed and undemanding register.
15827	6	a	A neat summation of how liberal thinking boils down to one symbol -- a soiled, tattered American flag, emblem of our supposed national shame -- and one phrase: 'Force him.'
15828	5	a	Dead Man is a strange, slow, unrewarding movie that provides us with more time to think about its meaning than with meaning. 
15829	4	a	It's all mano e snako, and lots of silly fun. At least Snakes on a Plane doesn't try to be anything but what it is.
15830	5	a	Stereotypes across the board, puerile one-upmanship games, and an utter failure to explain why, indeed, these two even were together.
15831	1	a	The theatrical version is some kind of compacted masterpiece, hormonal, vital, dazed, blissfully unhinged... I'm too attached to Donnie Darko to worry over its wanton weirdness, its mix of concreteness and intangibility.
15832	8	a	Man has the kind of dizzying tonal changes that makes one wonder if a P.A. should've administered a breathalyzer test on Levinson during production.
15833	5	a	Molly Ringwald is appealing, but the film has little else going for it.
15834	3	a	Moves at a rhythm akin to the gently lapping waves...yet somehow swiftly establishes the personalities of the three sisters, a contradiction that speaks to the resonance of the performers and Koreeda's skill at eliciting emotional truth.
15835	1	a	Making gorgeous use of grimy tunnels, writer-director Nimrod Antal frustrates expectations in the best possible sense.
15836	5	a	Further evidence that you can reanimate the dead only so many times.
15837	6	a	The incessant shots of old, and better, vampire movies on the various characters' TVs become distracting and annoying.
15838	6	a	Orange County is a likable curiosity, but never more. If it's remembered at all, it will be as the starting point for a new generation of Hollywood stars.
15839	3	a	Simple, relentlessly charming fairytale conjures some old-fashioned Mouse House magic - and a star-making turn from Amy Adams.
15840	5	a	Too often, diarrhea-into-a-hat feels like a metaphor for what MacFarlane's doing with the movie.
15841	3	a	Early Gere film with fabulous cinematography.
15842	6	a	A ridiculous film, but I guess I had fun watching it.
15843	5	a	The expected misunderstandings ensue, as you'd expect, which would be pretty excruciating if not for the performances of Hoffman and Streisand.
15844	6	a	A hit-or-miss movie.
15845	9	a	Heavy-handed, unbelievable, predictable, and when without Gwenyth, a not very exciting film to find oneself bouncing ultimately boredly through.
15846	1	a	Among the least cynical and most humanistic features of recent times.
15847	3	a	Although is not for everyone, Sausage Party is an irreverent animated comedy with a surprising depth and social criticism. [Full review in Spanish]
15848	4	a	The story line is too slight... but thanks to a showstopping performance by Chadwick Boseman, Get on Up is quite entertaining.
15849	3	a	What we get is a larger metaphor about change that is as adaptable now to our current Commander-In-Chief as it is to many difficult transitions throughout history.
15850	4	a	The many millions who swooned over their romance in Titanic should expect to encounter a very different couple in Revolutionary Road. The bloom is very much off the rose.
15851	3	a	A lighthearted, good old-fashioned jungle adventure.
15852	2	a	[James'] remarkably winning performance turns Blart into the ultimate underdog--a decent guy who's finally having the kind of day he deserves.
15853	2	a	[A] gleeful, gaudy tribute to one ungainly misfit and her determination.
15854	9	a	...exceptionally preachy...
15855	4	a	A well-acted entertainment that's highly respectful of the story it has to tell. It's disjointed but fun to watch.
15856	3	a	Deeply emotional, distressing drama not for faint of heart. 
15857	4	a	As drama, Cadillac is adequate. As a jukebox musical, it soars.
15858	0	a	Miles Teller is riveting. The cast is strange, but also superb. 
15859	6	a	A very creepy ghost story that is long on atmosphere and mercifully short on blood and gore.
15860	0	a	no ordinary bio-pic. It is as kinetic and as kaleidoscopic as the radical new approach to music Brown introduced.
15861	5	a	The murders themselves, apparently revenge for the robbery of a high-roller, were indeed messy. But they don't hold a candle to the disarray that is director and co-writer James Cox's film.
15862	3	a	...Thrilling, it's intriguing and most of all, a lot of fun. It frankly takes a welcome 'byte' out of every other blockbuster on show at the moment
15863	3	a	There's a directness to the production that might feel blunt were it not elevated by Moore and Baldwin's heartbreaking duet performance ....
15864	1	a	I say good for Russell for risking a protagonist who requires some patience and forgiveness.
15865	2	a	It makes for good family viewing.
15866	4	a	An inoffensively average, formulaic entertainment with a marketing-problematic point of view.
15867	0	a	Raiders is a classic and repeated viewings, especially when presented properly on the big screen, only reinforce this further.
15868	4	a	Hitch isn't a memorable date.
15869	3	a	A witty, winning Austen bio for tweens and older.
15870	1	a	Mara's Lisbeth can be brashly young and impossibly smart. It's a performance that should well serve the upcoming sequels.
15871	4	a	Cianfrance's moving but messy melodrama can't quite conjure the elusive alchemy of adaptation.
15872	3	a	...a stylish, violent crime drama where you either go along for the ride or shouldn't bother getting on.
15873	3	a	...has all the features of greatness except the magic.
15874	1	a	Hardly a walk in the park, this powerful journey is one of Van Sant's darkest. Grips the viewer in a vice of guilt that gets tighter to the point of strangulation. A dark and gripping masterpiece.
15875	8	a	Agonizingly lame.
15876	4	a	A guilty pleasure...
15877	1	a	"Cinema that's challenging and offbeat is always in danger of being overlooked. But ""The Rider"" deserves to be seen."
15878	3	a	While the narrative on the whole is ultimately very straightforward and uncomplicated, the weight is provided by some tremendous performances, incredible style, and a magnificent score.
15879	4	a	Debuting actor Chi Cao's athleticism is the movie's most striking element.
15880	0	a	No one wins awards for movies like this, but this is escapist entertainment raised to the level of art.
15881	2	a	The challenge thus set of making Venice the moving force in propelling the play has been met by Mr. Lean as the director with magnificent feeling and skill.
15882	0	a	DreamWorks rules, and Chicken Run is king.
15883	3	a	If most of the characters seem underdeveloped, they are also convincing and interesting.
15884	4	a	Slow, depressing family drama finely acted
15885	3	a	Other actors would have milked the dramatic opportunities here for all they were worth, but Nixon and Abbott - the latter glimpsed briefly in A Most Violent Year - keep their sights on the heartbreaking inevitability of the situation.
15886	6	a	An assassination thriller that boasts the glossy tourist vistas of an airline magazine combined with a serious case of instant-replay-itis.
15887	3	a	As The Empire Strikes Back was to Star Wars, so Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets is to last year's freshman introduction. In short, it's bigger and better.
15888	6	a	Liebesman knows how to make us cringe whether it is the most graphic of violence, or those spine-tingling moments where we are painfully waiting for something to jump out of the closet at us, or emerge from the darkness with a CHAINSAW.
15889	6	a	The final screenplay is as devoid of real emotion as it is of real characters.
15890	0	a	Fincher's achievement is, in both quality and spirit, a film of great beauty, and it touched me deeply.
15891	4	a	While not a classic by any means, is still a mostly entertaining experience.
15892	8	a	"It takes roughly five minutes before the first fart joke arrives in ""The Road Chip,"" with the production wasting little time before they reach for desperation."
15893	4	a	We've seen variations on the character before. But Fanny Ardant's performance as the straitlaced wife ... is insightful and note-perfect.
15894	1	a	What takes it to the level of important cinema ... is the central Selby-Wuornos relationship, which turns out to be symbiotic in the manner of the Smith-Hickock relationship in In Cold Blood.
15895	9	a	It's hard to care about anything going on in this shapeless would-be franchise, which lurches from scene to scene without building any real excitement.
15896	4	a	There isn't much plot here; just an impressive amount of street partying, all the more impressive for recreating period, with swarms upon swarms of reveling extras, on the cheap. 
15897	4	a	It's still schlock, mind you -- but artful schlock, and a marked improvement over the preceding entry.
15898	0	a	An intoxicating masterpiece, and the very best film to come from China's Fifth Generation.
15899	5	a	Even as a musical celebration, the movie is a misfire. Instead of re-creating the ecstatic, improvisatory flow of Brown's stage act, the film cuts almost everything into glittering bits and pieces.
15900	7	a	They are both visually very stunning to look at, both a wee on the wooden side, acting-wise, and both a mite forgettable.
15901	3	a	Let's hope Wright, Pegg and Frost concoct more wild doomsday scenarios together. Their work makes for a good time at the movies ...
15902	3	a	Sally Field triumphs in her first full-bodied leading role in a film in years. 'Doris' skillfully walks the line between broad comedy and emotional drama, never missing a beat.
15903	5	a	It's not funny, though it tries to be, and it has nothing serious to say about the politics of the SATs, though it purports to.
15904	6	a	This is not about a reluctant hero drawing courage from some deep personal well. It's not about dread and danger. It's about visual effects.
15905	3	a	It's a film with depth, tackling big issues while managing to be an immensely personal story at the same time.
15906	3	a	It's a fun flick, even though its wizardry is more technical than imaginative.
15907	4	a	not awful, but getting there
15908	10	a	Often evoking the dark humour of a Beckett play, with its world a relatively plausible representation of an unforgiving and tragic universe.
15909	6	a	[Cruise] looks about as German as Jackie Chan would in a lederhosen.
15910	5	a	It sounds like a vehicle with plenty of comedy mileage, but Failure To Launch quickly runs out of steam.
15911	3	a	Schrader has made his best film in years with his eco-warrior country priest.
15912	6	a	There's a sharp comedy to be made about America's misadventures in Afghanistan. This isn't it.
15913	4	a	The well-worn platitudes and pained moralising are a bit much, but the music is tremendous.
15914	4	a	'Fast Five' will push all your action buttons, and some you haven't thought of. So what if you hate yourself in the morning.
15915	1	a	Not content to simply re-create the success of its predecessor, the sequel... reveal[s] itself to be a surprisingly philosophical work.
15916	7	a	It is not even bad enough to be good camp comedy.
15917	3	a	Menashe is all about capturing the painful dynamic of feeling completely alienated, even when you're in a room surrounded by people just like you.
15918	1	a	What we learn about the evils of colonialism and the importance of chronicling one's past, whether European, American or indigenous, is transcendent.
15919	3	a	The Incredibles is a zippy, visually powerful riff on what happens when a hero feels like a zero.
15920	6	a	Presumably, the audience is stunned that it can understand the filmic metaphors... and thus, they must be genius. 
15921	9	a	In form and content, plotting and politics, the film is egregiously disguised as a smug, inspirational piece, but in reality, it is the cinematic equivalent of being offered free hugs from Donald Trump.
15922	2	a	A good time.
15923	6	a	Feels like three. But Hugh Grant and Sandra Bullock have some wonderful moments together, as the airhead boss and the drudge who becomes a swan.
15924	1	a	Spielberg is enough of a master showman to break up the horror with small rewards.
15925	2	a	Shot with an annoying lack of color, this is a less than compelling, but still moderately interesting, look at FBI agent Mark Felt aka DeepThroat, telling a Watergate story with no Bernstein and little Woodward.
15926	8	a	Has there ever been an uglier animated feature? The eerie, fever-dream-like faux three-dimensionality, the cyborg-like humanoids, the septic, etiolated colors.
15927	1	a	Above all, Allen manages to capture something warm and wonderful about the love of a city, similar to the feeling he captured about New York in his early films Annie Hall and Manhattan.
15928	2	a	It's a good, solid little film about a man whose story deserves better.
15929	6	a	A pitchy affair that ultimately misses its mark.
15930	6	a	"A movie with one too many agendas-especially considering it is inspired by a real-life female singer who broke the gender barrier on the actual ""Afghan Star."
15931	4	a	The character interaction is pleasant, but there's only so much Sharif and Boulanger can do with the underwritten screenplay.
15932	6	a	As she did with her first script, the gender-bending 'Kissing Jessica Stein,' Westfeldt goes for something radical and winds up pulling her punches when things start getting interesting. 
15933	1	a	Everyone loves a good murder mystery. And with a distinguished director like Robert Altman at the helm, and with talent like Glenn Close, Patricia Neal, Charles Dutton, Ned Beatty, and Julianne Moore, it would be hard to miss.
15934	5	a	A disappointingly limp small-town farce played several shades too broadly by a cast that has done better work elsewhere.
15935	3	a	The skilfully re-created look of the era in the actual locations lets the viewer drop right into one of the darkest chapters in U.S. history, a time when blind hatred and bigotry set public policy.
15936	2	a	As you would expect from a Spielberg film, the production values are first rate, with great special effects and great visuals, especially the stunning way the digital world of Oasis appears. The acting, and of course the direction, are both solid.
15937	3	a	Wittier by the reel, Bolt is can't-miss family entertainment, and a glad relief from the solemnities of award season.
15938	2	a	Even if it's a bit mannered and over-constructed, there's plenty in here to get us thinking
15939	3	a	Whether we're closely gazing at Maria or watching her stride along the ashy volcano's side from a distance, Bustamante lets images linger long enough for their beauty to fall away, giving us a compelling and tragic look at where our coffee comes from.
15940	4	a	"The Chamber of Secrets,"" while more visually striking and entertaining, still suffers from many of the same problems that plagued ""The Sorcerer's Stone."
15941	3	a	A laugh-out-loud funny, adrenaline-fueled romp.
15942	5	a	It's difficult to know who this downbeat film is for exactly.
15943	5	a	With subplots about pregnant girlfriends, drug-dealing cousins, and other sob stories that are mentioned but not developed, Coach Carter's exceptional message is delivered with little imagination.
15944	5	a	Without Kate Winslet's on-screen presence, this small, quirky Australian film is unlikely to gain any traction.
15945	9	a	Unimaginative.
15946	4	a	If you think that Cradle's plot sounds stupid, that's because it is.
15947	6	a	The thing in this film that feels most alive is a slice of cheese rotting on a playground blacktop -- which would be a funny joke if it was intentional.
15948	0	a	The Da Vinci Code's basically The Sound of Music compared to this.
15949	3	a	It offers the rare combination of romance, humor, an inventive conceit and social relevance, without adhering slavishly to rom-com conventions.
15950	7	a	a respectful but inert advertisement for intercultural cooperation
15951	2	a	Often scarier for what it doesn't say or show, which may also make it somewhat frustrating, since you're never sure exactly what's happening either.
15952	7	a	Surely there is some middle ground between a history lesson and mindless action-adventure. The people who made Valkyrie not only didn't find that ground; they weren't even looking for it.
15953	5	a	"The questioning yields but modest insights, more along the line of ""love is a hard thing to find--when you have it, keep it"" than any heretofore undiscovered secret formulas."
15954	5	a	An object lesson in how not to adapt a comic book. A crushing disappointment.
15955	1	a	Mysterious and complex, as it muses bittersweetly on marriage, longing and the disconnectedness one can feel from another culture or people.
15956	3	a	The key to the film is Foster, who reminds us why she's so missed these days.
15957	4	a	The heavy hand of screenwriter-director makes for preachy viewing.
15958	3	a	Not prime Brooks, but good enough.
15959	3	a	These are fascinating, three-dimensional individuals brought into the foreground by a pair of today's finest actors.
15960	3	a	Aided by two very strong performances from Ben Affleck and Gwyneth Paltrow and filled with a number of really well written scenes by Roos.
15961	9	a	In case we haven't had enough fear-mongering in the past few years, this schlock takes up the slack.
15962	4	a	A thorny, welcome reminder of the mainstream media's short-term memory regarding the abduction, extradition and torture of innocent Muslims under the Bush administration and beyond.
15963	3	a	Theron's triumph elevates the rest of the movie, which tends to wobble between harsh docudrama and sensationalistic TV drama.
15964	9	a	What's to hate? Let me count the ways. The laziness of the writing. The numbing overreliance on poop and pee jokes. The long, arid stretches between anything resembling a joke.
15965	2	a	It's best seen as a breezy entertainment and a reminder of how potent some of these performers -- many of whom are dead -- were in their primes.
15966	4	a	Whiskey Tango Foxtrot is sometimes entertaining, sometimes annoying, and sometimes does make us think. Even so, it's just not as deep as it wants or needs to be to hit home. 
15967	9	a	It is, quite plainly, like watching a movie that's trying to go out of its way to be horrible.
15968	3	a	"Overall ""Still Alice"" feels rather incomplete, but the blemishes are overshadowed by some tender and potent moments, a lovely score by Ilan Eshkeri and Julianne Moore's fantastic performance."
15969	5	a	Paper Towns romanticizes a lost-and-found teenage daydream that comes across as a little insincere and more than a bit tone deaf.
15970	6	a	As ever, the jokes are a jumble of the gross, the baggy, the raunchy, the mistimed, and -- every once in a while -- the refreshingly incorrect.
15971	9	a	... goes after its targets like a clueless klutz oblivious to the fact that the ticking bomb he's carrying is about to blow up in his face. 
15972	6	a	The Road Chip hardly qualifies as great cinema. And really, no adult goes to these films because they want to. But it is a perfectly serviceable accompaniment to a choc top and bag of popcorn.
15973	6	a	Uneven in tone and pacing, Larry suffers from an identity crisis, unsure whether it's a wacky, back-to-school comedy or a bittersweet portrait of two lost souls at the crossroads.
15974	4	a	While it won't win points for originality, The Bounce Back is a charming and occasionally really funny romantic comedy.
15975	9	a	An insult to the viewer's intelligence, which sticks to silly slapstick while failing to get around to making a mature statement about relationships.
15976	4	a	MacGraw never could act her way out of a paper bag, but she dies very prettily, cuing Oscar winning violins and O'Neal's Big Scene.
15977	2	a	Dey ultimately lets Chan down. If the legendary actor could have brought in old school chum Sammo Hung, he could have made this a great picture.
15978	5	a	Home runs for all the young actors with Reeves stuck at second base.
15979	3	a	Jindabyne is wonderfully acted by Laura Linney and Gabriel Byrne, two first-rate performers working close to the bone and concerned foremost with making an audience understand their characters, as opposed to merely liking them.
15980	1	a	Campion's big-sisterly encouragement of Cornish's lovely, openhearted performance -- and Whishaw's well-matched response -- results in a character instantly, intimately recognizable to anyone remembering her own first love.
15981	0	a	It is monumental movie-making: visually thrilling, technically astonishing, and emotionally engaging.
15982	6	a	"It needs a smarter script. It needs at least two or three perfectly engineered, joke-after-joke sequences. It needs a smart director - did you really do ""Wag the Dog,"" Levinson? - whose idea of political satire goes beyond freshman-year sarcasm."
15983	3	a	The tragic loss of Philip Seymour Hoffman resonates through Anton Corbijn's challenging but ultimately rewarding thriller.
15984	0	a	[Eastwood] masterfully gives the story and characters their proper amount of breathing room and translates the script into fluid, fertile visual passages dripping with heart, heartache, passion, compassion and rage.
15985	9	a	... writer-director Ron Shelton is a long way from the cerebral wit of his Bull Durham heyday.
15986	1	a	Soderbergh is back for real, with no signs of rust at all 
15987	7	a	A cobbled-together clone of Sex and the City, minus most of the humor and poignance.
15988	6	a	It just wants to play some of the big hits you love while ticking off a checklist of standard biopic milestones.
15989	6	a	Aiming for a different angle, the fifth installment, which is technically proficient, slightly tweaks the formula in a way that should please the series' loyal fans but won't recruit new ones.
15990	4	a	Depp performance certainly makes the film worthwhile by itself.
15991	6	a	There's very little that the filmmakers haven't borrowed here, making Astro Boy feel as copied as its title character.
15992	4	a	Mainstream telling of the making of Psycho is missing part of the story
15993	4	a	The non-musical version of Chicago. It's fun and cynical.
15994	3	a	This is one special film and in some ways fantastic. -- also INTERVIEW w/BJORK
15995	6	a	...more of a sedate lecture on values than a revealing or entertaining look at life and love.
15996	2	a	The critters themselves are pretty darn adorable, and watching them mature is probably the most engaging part of the film.
15997	3	a	For once, a sequel would be welcome.
15998	8	a	As the coward Robert Ford, Casey Affleck is a revelation. Nothing you have seen from him will prepare you for his brilliant work as the childlike young man who goes on to be the downfall of his hero.
15999	1	a	The only thing more astonishing than its subversive sense of humor and general anarchy is the fact that a studio is putting it in wide release.
16000	5	a	Not so much a slow burner as a damp squib.
16001	8	a	...if the director, the producer, and the writer approved of the added scenes, I'm not going to complain. One way or the other, Amadeus remains a great film.
16002	6	a	Though it is intermittently amusing, the movie unwisely chooses broad jokes over subtle humor, coy casting over talented actors, and forced feel-good moments over genuine emotion.
16003	5	a	What makes this film boring?
16004	9	a	The film is ludicrous and poorly directed, and the cast appears to be looking for the exit.
16005	0	a	Trust me, this is the real thing.
16006	3	a	Damon, who carries a certain blankness and anger with him, is right at home playing people who don't quite fit in and are tying desperately to find where they belong.
16007	6	a	Its most relevant message for today is a warning against vigilante ethnic cleansing.
16008	4	a	A nostalgic indulgence which, like the cinematic equivalent of a fluffy fanzine, eschews serious criticism of a revered icon in favor of a pleasant parade of his most memorable classics. 
16009	3	a	Some things have dated - Sam Jackson wouldn't be allowed to smoke in the office; everyone would have mobiles; Google Earth would have kept the island from being kept a secret - but the power of the film's pioneering CGI remain strangely undiminished.
16010	6	a	Nelson's work is relentless, grueling and courageous.
16011	7	a	The biggest disappointment lies in Uli Edel.
16012	1	a	James Bond goes home in every sense in this ravishingly entertaining entry in the series. Five decades later, it all of a sudden feels fresh, fun, and utterly engaging. 
16013	4	a	Even with a captivating, Oscar-nominated performance by the star, the servant remains inscrutable beneath that starched collar.
16014	1	a	The movie takes us down an unexpected path with riveting skill and a refreshing lack of easy answers.
16015	5	a	Lurching from admirably frank, multifaceted depictions of human physical and psychological survival to scenes so hokey they're almost surreal, the movie is like a thoroughbred horse without a jockey -- a thing of beauty running nowhere.
16016	9	a	...worthless garbage...
16017	3	a	Effective, unique horror movie.
16018	3	a	There isn't a single original plot development in Unaccompanied Minors, which is why it's a surprise that the movie is so much fun.
16019	9	a	Big stinking pile of dino poo-poo.
16020	9	a	Uninspired and only faintly funny.
16021	1	a	It's confident in its approach and doesn't shy away from its central purpose. It's a morality tale that engulfs your conscience with terrifying and difficult questions.
16022	3	a	"More viscerally charged than ""Speed"" and hipper than ""Die Hard With a Vengeance,"" the movie is a careening, screeching joyride that showers sparks like fireworks."
16023	1	a	So many layers of double-cross, lies, betrayal, grandiosity, and sheer insanity that the audience may feel they are getting lost, but in a way, that is the point. 
16024	4	a	Still, stellar actresses Annette Bening and Naomi Watts rise above every impediment, delivering memorably luminous moments as mother and child, separated at birth. 
16025	4	a	"When there are so many sophisticated animated movies coming to the theaters, it's likely that ""Rock Dog"" may soon be forgotten."
16026	5	a	A gloriously tacky Italian romance.
16027	5	a	Ewan really needs more lessons before he attempts an American accent again.
16028	4	a	It's as if Gibson is measuring God's love by the amount of blood he shows on the screen.
16029	1	a	McDonagh's admirable shading of ostensible heroes and villains backfires as character inconsistency...Nevertheless, Three Billboards wickedly entertains and provokes...
16030	9	a	Indistinguishable dumb action comedy.
16031	6	a	There's enough material here for a television mini-series, and cramming it into less than two hours can't help but make it seem like a Cliffs Notes version.
16032	3	a	A cynical, dark thriller with a marshmallow centre, Veronica Mars is both a labour of love for a legion of fans, and the kind of shrewd, focused, character-driven mystery that has become an endangered species on the big screen.
16033	5	a	Not even Grant's shoulders are broad enough to lift a scattershot script that defies explanation in any sort of linear way.
16034	2	a	Filmed with lots of style and a macabre sense of humor the master himself would have enjoyed.
16035	3	a	I am afraid I laughed from start to finish.
16036	6	a	Typical innocuous Elvis vehicle that might be brainless but at least is pleasant.
16037	0	a	This is an amazing looking film.
16038	3	a	A small, poignant gem despite its laggardly pacing. Definitely an off-beat, side show attraction, but with three big rings of heart, character, and soul.
16039	1	a	One of the most pleasurably offbeat experiences since the Philadelphia Eagles last enjoyed a winning season. 
16040	4	a	Showing improvement as action director, Justin Lin has made an unpretentious thrill ride of a movie, one of the few Hollywood pics whose characters reflect America's multi-racial composition.
16041	5	a	The icon's first big screen appearance is sure to be a let down for his long-time fans, too light for their sophisticated tastes and too dark for the simpler appetites of their children.
16042	6	a	Much like the lives it depicts, Mondays in the Sun is repetitious, uneventful and, in the end, dull.
16043	6	a	Alfie no longer has its bite. Sure, there's plenty of bad behavior, but Jude Law's Alfie is, as scoundrels go, a pretty nice guy.
16044	1	a	Since most thrillers ignore matters of logic, character and pacing, Joy Ride is an innovation because it doesn't.
16045	3	a	Subtle and quietly powerful - partly novelistic, partly poetic
16046	0	a	Padilha edits the lethal standoff into a human tragedy, a journalistic thriller and a powerhouse social drama.
16047	4	a	Despite a strong cast that includes Ed Harris, Jim Sturgess, Colin Farrell and Saoirse Ronan, we never really get to know any of the sloggers.
16048	9	a	...homosexual characters in romantic comedies serve the same role that Eunuchs did in the ancient Middle East:nonsexual good listeners who exist to assist hapless rich women.
16049	5	a	Too enamoured of genre convention to reach for the comic dynamite.
16050	3	a	The Edge succeeds ably in blending his famously acerbic dialogue with nerve-racking adventure scenes.
16051	1	a	A brilliant satire on modern American life.
16052	5	a	Director Brian Robbins is no John Hughes, though he does strive for 'message movie' status.
16053	4	a	Corny and cliched
16054	4	a	Takes off well, but boy is the landing bumpy.
16055	5	a	Two Dozens and Ours together don't have a dozen laughs between them.
16056	4	a	Although perhaps unlikely to become a classic passed on from generation to generation, there is a lot to like in this enjoyable, fun adventure. 
16057	2	a	As entertaining as it is heartfelt.
16058	3	a	Just as Jaws made us fear the water, WOTW makes us wary of the weather. You'll never again look at lightning in quite the same way.
16059	0	a	Guadagnino hasn't adapted Aciman's novel so much as interrogated its moods, going at it con brio.
16060	4	a	Is ambition is encouraging, and its dark musings are certainly provocative.
16061	0	a	Perfection lingers in each frame as Tarkovsky crafts one of the finest films ever made, an ecstatic story about art that has little interest in the artist himself, but in the power of art to transcend the age that produces it.
16062	4	a	Elaborately awful.
16063	6	a	If you like a film where everyone repeats the central, expositional message - work less, play more - ad nauseum, then this might work better for you then it did for me.
16064	0	a	The movie hovers just above moments of fact and reportage, resting almost totally on a cloud of passion and emotion. The fact that Keats was one of the greatest romantic poets is merely a bonus and an excuse for some gorgeous, glorious dialogue.
16065	3	a	If you enjoyed Meet the Parents, you'll have just as much fun in Meet the Fockers.
16066	9	a	Watch it at your own risk.
16067	10	a	Forgettable formulaic comedy.
16068	3	a	It's Cranston's finest film performance.
16069	1	a	Is Nebraska a comedy or a drama? Like life, it's both. Payne takes his time. Deal with it. This is a movie to bring home and live with, to kick around in your head after it hits you in the heart. It's damn near perfect, starting with the acting.
16070	7	a	A hypocritical purveyor of the same schlock nonsense it pretends to lampoon.
16071	3	a	Managed to win me over with a combination of British charm, clever writing, and well-executed performances. 
16072	6	a	It oozes importance, is heavy with worthiness and lies there, waiting to be appreciated for the beautiful thing it is.
16073	1	a	By turns cheeky, surreal, exhilarating and stomach-churning.
16074	5	a	Hampered by its lack of narrative tension or palpable sense of romance.
16075	8	a	Hollywood has rarely produced a series of films as consistent as those based on video games: A dozen of them now, and not one has been any good.
16076	2	a	Like Smokey and the Bandit for a younger, more fly, urban generation.
16077	1	a	Not only does 'The Artist' clearly demonstrate that something was lost when movies started talking, but it also proves that we haven't begun to learn what can be done with images alone.
16078	0	a	How [Brooks] emerged an abler artist is worth puzzling over; I suspect it has something to do with sheer instinct triumphing over industry machinery.
16079	3	a	Theron makes an amazing physical and emotional transformation.
16080	5	a	It's a marginally successful attempt to flare up the senses through shocking repetition, but this is Moritz after all, so if you must go, leave your brain at home and sneak in a cocktail to help wash down the nonsense.
16081	3	a	This comes to life through another amazing performance by Bryan Cranston.
16082	6	a	This was supposed to be Brooks's comical stab at social injustice, a kind of My Man Godfrey for the nineties, but it doesn't work.
16083	4	a	While Mehari's motives could not be more honourable, his methods leave much to be desired.
16084	3	a	Hopelessly depressing epic starring John Turturro and John Goodman. The Coen brothers have perfected the dark comedy to an art form.
16085	3	a	I found it flawed but fascinating, and a no-fail showcase for Tina Fey's real talents as a serious actress. Best of all, this movie is never boring for a single minute.
16086	2	a	[Cassavetes] creates an astonishing amount of tension building towards his 'I-can't-believe-this-is-really-going-to-happen' climax.
16087	4	a	I felt like a donkey laughing so hard at such stupidity and I feel like even more of a donkey admitting it in print.
16088	0	a	Tells its screw-loose story in such a forthright manner and with such heedless and fearless energy that you won't be able to take your eyes off the screen, even if you are busy rubbing them out of sheer disbelief.
16089	3	a	An evolutionary leap from a true master of his craft.
16090	6	a	The major difference between the two movies is that Caine's Alfie represented a threatened breed of opportunistic man, while Law's comes off as a typical commitment-challenged bachelor.
16091	0	a	The Rider is Jandreau's story to tell, and he relives every moment of this terrible time in his life with an unbelievable stoicism and psychological depth.
16092	8	a	[MacFarlane] thinks he's winking-making bad jokes to subvert their precise calculation with awkward explanations he hopes conjure laughs-but it's a plea of desperation.
16093	5	a	This new Phoenix makes too many mistakes, the biggest one being the mistake of confusing 'modernizing' with 'dumbing down.'
16094	9	a	A sugar-sweet, nutty kind of chip-muck, but cinematic excrement all the same.
16095	3	a	We can never have too many scenes of half-naked beautiful people spaced out in slo-mo to Giorgio Morodor-like music.
16096	6	a	Lee wants us to experience what it's like to be Billy. But he never makes us feel it.
16097	4	a	A strange but ceaselessly fascinating barrage of music and imagery with nothing in the center to hold it all together.
16098	3	a	[A] warmly enveloping exploration of grief, guilt and gradually letting go.
16099	3	a	Julie Walters ... is spirited and colorful as the ballet teacher, and Gary Lewis is somehow convincing as the dad even when the screenplay requires him to make big offscreen swings of position.
16100	6	a	...a little more convincing and plausible than its predecessor, even if it is not enough reason to actually recommend the follow-up either.
16101	5	a	"Palo Alto"" is ""Fast Times at Ridgemont High"" without the wit; ""River's Edge"" without the depth. It's like reading a first novel by a talented writer who has something to say but isn't yet sure how to say it."
16102	0	a	Soaked in paranoia, Cukor's superb pyschological thriller is a period film noir, just like Hitchcock's The Lodger and Hanover Square, both set in the Edwardian age.
16103	7	a	Seeing the character's protean quirks reminds one of Dr. Evil's speech about luge lessons; it's that ridiculous.
16104	3	a	A deliriously imperfect film - and all the better for it.
16105	3	a	Fincher's fascination with, and film's illusory power over, time deepened the mystery of his previous film, Zodiac. Such insights also redeem Button from its cuteness and kitsch.
16106	4	a	Wristcutters opens with what proves to be its best scene, one that could stand alone as a brilliant short subject.
16107	6	a	Is it fun? Sort of. But it shoulda coulda been a ton of fun.
16108	6	a	Even [Hartnett] can't overcome the lameness of the movie's increasingly obvious attempts to make horniness seem funny.
16109	2	a	Sober and deliberately understated, Chappaquiddick sometimes struggles to keep up the tension. But the film rests on strong performances and an evocative sense of period atmosphere.
16110	0	a	To understand the breadth of disco-era deception laid out in American Hustle, understand that the most honest character in the movie is a politician. Not entirely honorable but compared with the swindle sharks circling, he's Jimmy Carter on Sundays.
16111	4	a	If you've seen the original, there's absolutely no difference in what happens. And very little reason to check it out.
16112	1	a	A fact-based feature film both celebrating and illuminating the disappearing, dangerous art of the war correspondent.
16113	4	a	If viewers aren't looking for anything remotely sophisticated and don't mind the broad, repetitive comedy or potentially offensive stereotypes, they might just find themselves enjoying this lightweight film -- to some degree.
16114	4	a	Part One of director Peter Jackson's planned film trilogy of J.R.R. Tolkien's The Hobbit forces audiences to run an obstacle course before the fun kicks in.
16115	7	a	The contrived setup doesn't make much sense, and the movie throws in far too many extraneous antagonists and dead-end plot detours, none of which are entertaining.
16116	3	a	It's like the death of true creative fashion happening before our eyes. The insight into a fashion house like Valentino is illuminating.
16117	3	a	[Eastwood] isn't afraid to take his time telling a story, letting it breathe like a good wine and thereby making it feel more like life than a movie.
16118	3	a	The film itself veers dangerously towards tedium, but it saves itself with interesting stylistic choices and stellar performances from its three young leads.
16119	3	a	Just the sheer number of characters flitting around, each scrambling for plot space, gives an idea of just how frantic this movie can be. But Russell expertly uses all of it for maximum emotional -- and sometimes physical -- impact.
16120	2	a	It's fairly easy to guess where this is heading - well, the giant duck is a bit surprising - and mildly fun getting there.
16121	1	a	In a way, Flying Daggers might be compared to the great old MGM musicals that were driven in part by showy set pieces.
16122	6	a	Whatever the opposite of chemistry may be, McConaughey and Parker have plenty of it... one of the few romantic comedies in history in which the couple's fights are far more credible than their flirting.
16123	2	a	As to be expected, the Mamet-speak is sharp, witty and masterful.
16124	3	a	It doesn't have a brain in its head, but it's made with skill and style and, boy, is it fast and furious.
16125	7	a	With its emphasis on muddy streets, muddier language and raunchy behavior, Libertine is a trying experience.
16126	9	a	Like the pseudo biopic on Mandela, the rugby half is both shallow and generic, qualities echoed by the horrendously mawkish theme song 'Colorblind' that is enough to make Invictus seem like a parody of an inspirational film.
16127	3	a	Visually arresting and emotionally rich, Mars Needs Moms is another animated triumph from a rejuvenated Disney Animation.
16128	6	a	For all its great potential, Reign of Fire turns out to be just another bughunt movie -- a disappointingly talky, haphazard one.
16129	1	a	At the center [of Mary Queen of Scots] are fiery women fighting for their rightful place, queer representation and diverse casting that elevate this period drama and raises the bar for future ones.
16130	1	a	It is a surprisingly tight and densely-packed comedy with excellent performances all around.
16131	5	a	As generic as the title suggests, this routine psychological thriller about a yuppie shrink whose daughter is kidnapped can't be saved by Michael Douglas's screen presence.
16132	7	a	There's not nearly enough quality material to make Battle of the Year recommendable to anyone other than the most hard-core of dance fanatics.
16133	3	a	An exquisite little puzzle-box gem of clinically constructed perversity.
16134	4	a	The dysfunctional silbling-squabbling delivers diluted holiday cheer.
16135	4	a	This is a movie of extremes: alternately dazzling and deadening, careening between stylish and stultifying, tough going on occasion and smooth sailing the rest of the way. Yet in the final count, it's the virtues that save this Vice.
16136	3	a	Adorable fairy tale is a fabulous family flick.
16137	2	a	The film totally revolves around Pam and she carries the film with a lethal and sexy punch.
16138	4	a	Anderson ... has enough sense not to let the pace flag for a second, filling the screen with ravenous flesh-eaters, explosions and special effects.
16139	9	a	All pretty feeble stuff.
16140	8	a	Some Bond films show their age. Not Skyfall. It's super sky-high entertainment and brimming with excitement.
16141	6	a	I'm sure this script seemed like a good idea at the time, but the final product feels like a film student's idea of a Saturday Night Live sketch.
16142	4	a	[The World's End] soon turns from this not-quite-nostalgic focus to one more like Pegg and Edgar Wright's first two Cornetto movies, which is to say, a melding of well-known genres in order to spoof them.
16143	4	a	Slick, clever and entertainingly overheated while you're watching it, Basic Instinct starts to evaporate the second you leave the theater.
16144	3	a	Lo adorable de su elenco, lo divertido de su trama y su atractivo reparto, la hacen sumamente disfrutable
16145	4	a	While it is indeed pretty funny, the darkness got lost somewhere in the shuffle.
16146	3	a	The movie is not going to bring many new fans to the following, but hey -- it gots colour, speed and sparks.
16147	4	a	Gone is the dreamy atmosphere of sun-kissed decadence, replaced by joyless business transactions that are punctuated by short, sharp shocking bursts of violence...
16148	7	a	Not only does this movie lack the addictive charm of the series, but it also stands as one of the most boring anime films I've ever had to endure.
16149	3	a	If I had seen this film before the original, I might have actually preferred it.
16150	6	a	...The Edge is not only half-baked, warmed-over Hemingway.
16151	4	a	Duchovny exudes charm and humor throughout, and he alone nearly makes up for material that's generally rather flat.
16152	2	a	A visually impressive effort that mixes the pizzazz of an action-oriented popcorn movie with a more humane sensibility than is usually the case.
16153	0	a	A rare instance of great American filmmakers taking on a great American book, and winning.
16154	4	a	Uneven and with a pretty even hit:miss gag ratio, there is still not-for-Nan fun to be had here.
16155	5	a	... Comes apart at the seams, the victim of irreconcilable differences between Vaughn's schtick and the flimsy script.
16156	1	a	Clear proof that a great director can work in any genre and medium and produce great results.
16157	4	a	While it's just the sort of film Hollywood likes to embrace, one can only imagine the horrific hash a studio would've made of telling this sensitively told tale.
16158	9	a	Viewers of Timeline will wish they could go back in time themselves and avoid buying tickets in the first place. 
16159	3	a	It's an entertaining trifle that is at least as engaging as, and perhaps more likeable than, a majority of the filmmaker's recent excursions.
16160	3	a	Benjamin Button is strong because it connects with the human desire to transcend the inevitable constraints of time.
16161	4	a	David Twohy's taut, palm-sweating thriller has two things going for it: it keeps you guessing and it doesn't insult your intelligence.
16162	3	a	The fan of the series will go bonkers with this big-screen adaptation. However, the casual viewer can also find a catchy whodunit with some unexpected laughs.
16163	4	a	As usual, Fukasaku directs Battle Royale with force and conviction, even as the tone of the picture veers back and forth from unabashedly ludicrous to deadly serious.
16164	4	a	May just be the most quintessential Steven Spielberg movie Steven Spielberg never made.
16165	4	a	No Man's Land may end with an honest blip yet its history is remiss.
16166	4	a	Dialog is still witty enough to keep us laughing, but the characters are now saddled with contrived plotlines, corny slapstick and some feeble attempts at sentimentality.
16167	1	a	This is the kind of movie Braveheart will someday grow up to be and it should not be missed.
16168	6	a	An ineffective sequel in the two ways that are most important: it does not live up to the original's visual legacy, and it does not expand the characters or setting in a meaningful or consistent way.
16169	6	a	A road movie with its creative lanes clogged, and a Mack truck comedian barreling through, anyway. Melissa McCarthy, pound-for-pound the funniest woman in show biz these days, carries this cruel and usual raunchfest practically by default. 
16170	4	a	Raunchy for the sake of being raunchy. Poignancy, a key element in making any sex comedy something more important, is lacking.
16171	4	a	...Lazenby is actually pretty good as Bond.
16172	5	a	All-in-all, it's pretty forgettable.
16173	3	a	It's one of those rare comedies that makes you gasp with laughter until your eyes are watering and you start choking Diet Coke up through your nose.
16174	4	a	A deeply flawed movie whose... willingness to complicate the genre it appears to inhabit make it much more valuable than its original reception was willing to admit. 
16175	4	a	Everett almost single-handedly sustains the film, thanks to a nicely pitched turn as the headmistress with a heart.
16176	6	a	...few concessions have been made for neophytes to his particular brand of filmmaking.
16177	5	a	Even kids are likely to respond to Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles III with less enthusiasm than they did to the first two films in this series.
16178	3	a	...opens with a bang and picks up speed from there...spectacular cinematography...loaded to the gills with high octane music. 
16179	6	a	The story, involving conspiracies, doesn't always make sense. And the surprises are easy to predict; director John Moore doesn't try to hide them.
16180	4	a	It is a ridiculous, self-aware and entertaining film with mostly dudes, a high body count, lots of swearing and surprisingly bad CGI. And, somewhat incongruously, Alfie Allen doing a pretty good Dublin accent.
16181	4	a	Action-packed adventure a fun bet for young superhero fans.
16182	2	a	Menashe offers much food for thought.
16183	5	a	For all its shoot-outs, fistfights, and car chases, this movie is a phlegmatic bore, so tedious it makes the silly spy vs. spy film The Sum of All Fears, starring Ben Affleck, seem downright Hitchcockian.
16184	6	a	If only life were that simple
16185	7	a	On the shelf for at least two years, Jason X should have stayed there -- or at least headed straight to video during the Halloween season.
16186	9	a	Max just drags on as it drags you down. If you stay and watch the endless end credits, there's a short scene that hints a sequel is coming. That's what I call real pain.
16187	1	a	"A beautifully told story about discovering love, ""Call Me by Your Name"" is buoyed by the performance of its two lead actors. "
16188	6	a	It's got skill and craft and some good acting to recommend it. And it's based on a true story. But its soulless posturing and jaded cynicism are far more repellant than cool.
16189	4	a	The script lands a few solid blows for women's rights and mines a rich vein of humour, tossing up nuggets of both the morbid and deadpan variety.
16190	6	a	Barry Levinson, director of films as diverse as Diner, Bugsy, and Wag the Dog, is a national treasure. So, it is with deep disappointment that I report Man of the Year is dross.
16191	4	a	Enchanted is an enjoyable comedy with several hilarious gags and a genuinely charming performance from Amy Adams. Worth seeing.
16192	2	a	As for Stallone, he grimaces purposefully in his El Greco beard, and he keeps the body count coming so that it sates you like a junk-food craving fulfilled.
16193	3	a	A powerful, ironic film.
16194	4	a	The movie is hardly a masterpiece, but it does mark Ms. Bullock's best work in some time.
16195	0	a	Strangely, wonderfully, The Artist feels as bold and innovative a moviegoing experience as James Cameron's bells-and-whistles Avatar did a couple of years ago.
16196	3	a	Nevertheless, the performances are uniformly excellent with Oyelowo conveying both the iconic magnetism and human-sized modesty of King's personality.
16197	1	a	Even as we laugh, we're invited to consider the different approaches to [existentialism], which comes across as the flawed and funny but necessary human pursuit that it is.
16198	3	a	Smith and Bateman are great, and the first half of the movie is terrific. The second half...well, you'll either go with it or you won't.
16199	9	a	Frequently pauses to shower someone with vomit, pus, urine or excrement. It should be called Meet the Bodily Fluids.
16200	6	a	As uneven as the film is, those with strong stomachs will find it worth sticking with.
16201	9	a	"Hereafter"" has some quality parts, but ultimately fails because it doesn't really care about what it's supposed to be about."
16202	5	a	Rest assured you've seen it all before.
16203	4	a	For slapsticky, loose-limbed, MAD Magazine-style movie satires, you can do no better than the works of director David Zucker.
16204	5	a	"Despite it's excellent cinematography, ""Skulls"" fails to ""flesh out"" a good premise."
16205	9	a	The more we learn about the bogeyman, the less terrifying he becomes.
16206	2	a	Despite the stitches, bruises and gashes, the group actually appears to be having fun, and it rubs off on the audience. At least, those of us who can stomach stupidity by the boatload.
16207	2	a	I recommend Doom with a lot of hesitation.
16208	4	a	It's message might be delivered in the form of a sermon, but the message is such a good one, that errors can be forgiven.
16209	6	a	Bright Star is a well-acted, well-crafted but excruciatingly tepid romantic film about a subject that will attract poetry lovers and yet test even their considerable patience.
16210	6	a	Though bewitchingly designed and filmed, it's hard to overlook that del Toro has made a horror film that barely rustles up a full-blooded scare for its entire running time.
16211	4	a	Whenever a new kids' film comes out, there's always the hope that it'll work for adults, too. Alas, not this time. But the kids will probably like it.
16212	0	a	... impeccable photography, idyllic cinematography and first class performances... [Full review in Spanish]
16213	5	a	The Last Witch Hunter is so drenched in CGI effects, it looks as if it's been dunked in a vat of lacquer.
16214	0	a	interesting and very good
16215	6	a	The style of Masterpiece Thetaer is applied to this reimagining of the making of writer Jane Austen, which will upset purists due to its liberties with Austen's real background.
16216	5	a	Identity Thief elicited one giant shrug from me. 
16217	8	a	Nothing in the film works, and here's something upon which people of all political affiliations can agree: Man of the Year is one of the worst of the year.
16218	3	a	This cautionary tale depicts consumers who believe they deserve stuff, whether or not they can pay for it. Rarely is this kind of truth seen onscreen in such a subtle and entertaining film.
16219	5	a	Diane Lane is too sexy and bright to play a bland divorcee whose decision for the evening is whether to wear her hair up or down and be reduced to an insecure teenager
16220	1	a	With Eastwood as Kincaid and Meryl Streep as Francesca, this carefully observant love story turns Waller's pop-lit passion into screen art.
16221	1	a	Pi accomplishes so much more with...its micro-budget than a Hollywood production could.
16222	3	a	[T]he film is tightly constructed in its plotting, while also being loose enough in its focus to appreciate what clever and relatable characters it possesses.
16223	4	a	The film launches a barrage of avian and porcine puns, plus a flock of knowing pop-culture references... Most of these will fly right over the heads of younger viewers, but the film's rambunctious silliness will go down a treat.
16224	2	a	The most genuinely apian aspect of Bee Movie is that it spends a lot of its running time buzzing happily around, sniffing out fresh jokes wherever they may bloom.
16225	3	a	Hitch will make dorky, husky guys like Kevin James and myself feel some hope that we too can date women who look like models
16226	4	a	"That a production this ambitious has been financed and distributed outside the studio system throws a curveball to anyone who thinks ""independent film"" can mean only urban moderns sitting in an apartment bemoaning their ennui."
16227	4	a	Harry's latest adventure has enough snakes, mandrakes, phoenix tears, Cornish pixies, climaxes and denouements to scare the J.R.R. Tolkien out of you.
16228	4	a	"You won't know whether or not to recommend it to your friends. They'll ask you if it was good or bad, and you'll only be able to respond with ""yes."
16229	3	a	A bittersweet Christmas movie with a strong black cast.
16230	1	a	The definitive dinosaur movie.
16231	0	a	It joins the pantheon of great con job movies with The Sting, House of Games and Wild Things.
16232	0	a	An unforgettable movie experience. David Oyelowo gives the performance of the year.
16233	1	a	Sam Mendes revitalizes the James Bond franchise with a slick and action-packed entry. Daniel Craig proves yet again why he's the best Bond yet.
16234	4	a	By the time Laurel Canyon closes, we're left with a number of dangling subplots, lots of questions and two hideously unbelievable reconciliations.
16235	9	a	Darling Companion is nothing more than another story about a trip into the glories of nature that is ruined by a swarm of annoying WASPs.
16236	3	a	Somewhat overly sentimental, lacking the novel's subtlety, and less interesting when the action leaves the ball park, Barry Levinson's beautifully shot film is nonetheless a charming fairy tale.
16237	5	a	"Despite Depp's bold turn as the scandalous poet, this disappointingly overwrought, poorly directed costume drama has more in common with Quills and Stage Beauty, all flawed movies about ""deviant"" artists who broke taboos."
16238	7	a	A far cheaper cousin to 'Flatliners' that, thanks to the better-than-average cast, is reasonably engaging for the first hour or so before deteriorating badly in a mayhem-filled finale.
16239	6	a	Perhaps director Tony Maylam was being too literal in adapting the novel to the screen, a novel that didn't translate well.
16240	5	a	The target audience - pre-teen girls - aren't going to notice the many shortfalls behind the camera. What they'll enjoy, regardless of quality, is some naughtiness true to the spirit of the series, Russell Brand and Girls Aloud.
16241	8	a	Encino Man is frighteningly dated, but it was never made to be timeless. I just wish the picture had more laughs or instinctive madness. 
16242	2	a	Stiller and De Niro play off well against each other, and neither goes too far off the deep end.
16243	3	a	The Break-Up is more like Annie Hall told with Chicago attitude and work ethic.
16244	6	a	The law of diminishing returns is in full effect here.
16245	2	a	A thoroughly enjoyable and surprisingly lightweight romantic comedy from writer-director James L. Brooks.
16246	3	a	Because we like this world, and the characters plug away at the jokes so enthusiastically, this film brings a smile to the face.
16247	2	a	Hereafter is an overly schematic melodrama that fails to raise a pulse. It's as lifeless as the ghosts that haunt the film's characters.
16248	5	a	There's hardly a scene you watch without wondering, and doubting, if Ramsay would have done it quite this way.
16249	3	a	There are many themes running through The Tin Drum: resistance against an unkind world, the need for acceptance, the horrors of romance and war, and the final idea that growth is inevitable and unfortunately, necessary.
16250	4	a	While Lane is her typical winning self, the film is mawkish.
16251	9	a	Devoid of wit and point.
16252	3	a	Hopkins makes a wonderful Hitchcock.
16253	5	a	They don't make 'em like this any more. And with good reason.
16254	9	a	Paris Can Wait is more fitting for the Food Network than a feature film. And even then, cooking shows have better editing etiquette, story structure and emotional appeal than this half-baked entree.
16255	4	a	Even though the story around him is at times questionable, the performance and realistic animated rendering of this character is the perfect distillation of Winnie-the-Pooh's essential, philosophical self.
16256	3	a	Even the biggest skeptics of the 'kids as super spies' conceit will likely find themselves looking forward to the already-in-the-works sequel.
16257	8	a	The movie's inability to showcase its greatest asset, the grace and control of its dancers, is its most conspicuous failing.
16258	4	a	Mindless, harmless popcorn flick. Emphasis on the mindless.
16259	2	a	Ralph Breaks the Internet is smart, charming and funny while also being pointed, effective and very timely.
16260	5	a	There's barely enough of a story to sustain a short film, much less a feature.
16261	3	a	A consistently amusing bit of animated whimsy from funnyman Jerry Seinfeld that has the observational comic's fingerprints all over it.
16262	0	a	Yeah, it really IS all that good.
16263	8	a	... a tearjerker which won't necessarily jerk your tears.
16264	5	a	Agora feels like an overlong school trip to the planetarium, followed by a Romans-in-togas play in the gym.
16265	6	a	"Larry Crowne"" has Tom Hanks and Julia Roberts and a good premise and a colorful supporting cast, but what it doesn't have is a reason for existing."
16266	10	a	A franchise sinks in this sequel's endless sea of incompetence.
16267	1	a	Moan slithers into some totally unexpected emotional territory by the time it all gets played out, and the film is peculiarly touching if you allow it to work its strange mojo on you.
16268	10	a	A no-stars, no-plot, no-point vampire spoof about a group of coeds studying abroad in a haunted castle, Transylmania boasts the kind of acting and direction usually relegated to the adult section of your local video store.
16269	9	a	Clever story up the sleeve, but nothing in the way of the wonder of magic. Honestly, I found the mood rather miserable.
16270	0	a	It's a great science-fiction piece, a razor-sharp satire, and an impressive calling card for an emerging Hungarian cinema.
16271	1	a	"A new trip down an ancient river, with shades of ""Apocalypse Now"" and ""Aguirre: Wrath of God."" Mesmerizing and occasionally mind-altering."
16272	0	a	The smile of recognition and understanding that closes things out is an unforgettable celebratory stunner that shook me right to my very core.
16273	4	a	There's a game-changing plot twist that is at first fascinating, but ultimately infuriating because the movie never capitalizes on it.
16274	3	a	More interesting for the things it leaves unsaid than the occasionally staid melodramatic story.
16275	4	a	Adults used to animation that runs on two tracks -- the upfront stuff for the tykes and a witty subtext to entertain big people -- may grow bored with the kid-leaning sensibility of Fly Me to the Moon.
16276	5	a	The movie is too sophisticated in its first hour for preteens, and much too tragically unhip in its second hour for the older teenage audience that might appreciate its pithier wisecracks.
16277	3	a	Viewers in the mood for rip-snorting marital combat should go ahead and partake, but they must prepare to leave the theatre in a state of profound depression.
16278	1	a	"OK, all you folks who loved the bizarre ""Mulholland Drive"" as much as I did. You're in for another mind-boggling, brain-teasing treat. "
16279	3	a	The car chase near the end of the film is one of most exciting shots ever.
16280	9	a	Jason Friedberg and Aaron Seltzer, the team behind Meet the Spartans, prove that ridiculing other movies is much easier than making your own.
16281	5	a	Because the story is so entirely straightforward, the beauty is more in the performances and in the subtle touches than in the journey itself.
16282	1	a	Aims right for the heart and aces its target.
16283	9	a	Mindless Snipes tripe.
16284	4	a	No idea what it wants to be about but a nice comeupance scene.
16285	3	a	Does An Unexpected Journey do a satisfactory job bringing audiences back to Middle Earth? The answer is 'yes' - if not as resolutely as I may have hoped - and the film is absolutely worth seeing for this quality alone
16286	4	a	The biggest problem, however, remains the animation style itself. Zemeckis' motion capture technology just isn't fit to depict human movement. Worse, it can't showcase a human eyeball to save its life.
16287	3	a	Lucas described THX as 'an artifact from the future,' and we're supposed to struggle for understanding. That's part of its hypnotic undertow.
16288	5	a	Hitch wastes both Will Smith and Kevin James with yet another convoluted romantic fable
16289	6	a	The film is marred by too many coincidences, but there are a couple of twists at the end that tug at the heartstrings and leave you with a warm feeling.
16290	6	a	The Break-Up fails to freshen the stale news that women are from Venus and men are from Mars.
16291	4	a	...the non-stop action doesn't just complicate the officers' relationships -- it prevents us from connecting strongly with them.
16292	3	a	You go expecting a World Cup qualifying round. You leave having just seen a decent enough exhibition match.
16293	4	a	Within the sprawling pantheon of undercover cop films, The Infiltrator will never be recognized as one of the genre greats. Within actor Bryan Cranston's body of work however, it will be remembered as the one he saved.
16294	0	a	This is an exquisite movie on every possible level, from the script and direction to the performances to the cinematography.
16295	5	a	A soulless amalgamation of several horror classics, and marks another dud in the career of Renee Zellweger. 
16296	2	a	Thanks to a commanding performance by Jude Law and a pleasingly slick application of style, Shyer manages to put some new spin on an old yarn.
16297	6	a	For all the wild controversy that Petey ignited in his time, Talk to Me ends up being as generic and watered-down as its title.
16298	4	a	Cassavetes' script buries a lot of character and thematic ambitions in the facts of the case.
16299	3	a	A sedate, intelligent and quietly sensuous film.
16300	10	a	Worse than merely 'pertinent'.
16301	4	a	A movie about an improbable friendship set against the backdrop of urban and cultural decay, The Soloist strives for deep meaning and settles for gritty reality.
16302	4	a	Empathy rescues it from the brink of disaster porn -- it's so good-hearted and optimistic that stressed-out moms will feel the flick speaks directly to them, which it does.
16303	5	a	Those who said Don DeLillo's book was unfilmable were wrong. This is a film. That much is undeniable. Whether it's a compelling one is a whole other question.
16304	4	a	The movie proceeds to show how everything, little by little, falls out of place -- not the most thrilling of events to cover, but interesting all the same.
16305	0	a	Engaging, at times vicious drama w/Lancaster as acidic gossip monger, Curtis fine as wimpy sidekick.
16306	1	a	Director David Fincher has crafted a disturbing dazzler of a thriller, embellished by sharp acting. 
16307	4	a	For childhood's sake, take your little guys and gals to see this movie -- you won't be disappointed.
16308	4	a	There's something very sweet about Roll Bounce but it has nothing to do with the roller rink or the skating.
16309	4	a	Because of all the cameos and in-jokes, this gimmicky weightless film should appeal to mostly film buffs.
16310	5	a	An inconsequential, harmless piece of moderately cute fluff
16311	2	a	Although laced with humor and a few fanciful touches, the film is a refreshingly serious look at young women.
16312	1	a	"The most famous act finds Garland and Astaire dressed as bums for ""A Couple of Swells,"" but there's also ... the pair tackling the title tune and -- my favorite -- Astaire showing off his incomparable tap-dancing prowess in ""Steppin' Out with My Baby."
16313	4	a	Despite a broad range of effective comedy and a decent laugh-per-minute ratio, Mallrats is likely to be a moderate disappointment for anyone who guffawed their way through the previous film.
16314	1	a	Fight Club confirms Edward Norton's ascent into the pantheon of actors like Robert DeNiro and Robert Duvall.
16315	2	a	Delivers some genuinely scary moments.
16316	3	a	[P]retty swell ... George Romero is back and, in this movie, he's better than ever.
16317	7	a	Ozon finds women aesthetically pleasing, but has no desire to get close.
16318	4	a	The style and mode are a little too heterogeneous to come together right, even though some images have a pared-down majesty, and the main line of the film is tough.
16319	5	a	The opening narration by Christopher Walken starts sucking the life out of the film before it gets a chance to gain any momentum.
16320	5	a	A Million Ways to Die in the West is a giant tumbleweed of a comedy drifting aimlessly through a laugh-free desert.
16321	6	a	It's everything the first movie wasn't: noisy, clumsy and derivative.
16322	4	a	What appeared to be another High School Musical, Bandslam delivers a well written script and an in depth story with sprinkles of cliches throughout.
16323	4	a	If only this set of memorable characters were serving a story that didn't feel half-rate.
16324	4	a	A battle waged in the hearts and minds is always likely to be far more inspiring than explosion-heavy scuffles in the street, but as shown here, that doesn't necessarily translate into captivating movie magic.
16325	1	a	Not a classic, but an unjustly forgotten oldie from the golden age of violent exploitation ...
16326	1	a	Get to the theater before the hype overwhelms the touching drama. Carol is worth falling in love with.
16327	3	a	Total Recall is slick, sly and subversive, and if some of the special effects have aged somewhat, that only adds to the charm.
16328	6	a	The greater question is why folks who have demonstrated relatively good judgment in the past equivocated themselves into a dimwit pot-boiler.
16329	1	a	Bright Star is one of those rare films that critics wait for and moviegoers can't wait to tell their friends about. Oscar nominations may be on their way at last.
16330	4	a	It's inventive and full of surprises.
16331	2	a	The film is very funny at times, and it takes some surprising turns, but it's also slow-paced and glum... A fine feel-bad comedy.
16332	4	a	A documentary that somehow manages to capture the anarchic spirit of those topsy-turvy times without devolving into anarchy itself.
16333	3	a	Wristcutters is a cut above most low-budget American indies, with something original to say about the human condition and an artful way of saying it.
16334	4	a	Lee Marvin clearly steals the film in his double role as the good guy/bad guy hired gunman.
16335	3	a	It's fairly solid--not to mention well edited so that it certainly doesn't feel like a film that strays past the two and a half mark.
16336	4	a	A Perfect Getaway is hardly groundbreaking, but it's a diverting slice of escapism that wallows in manipulating the viewer.
16337	6	a	"Murray, a funnyman who long ago lost his fastball, was foolish to entrust his ""comeback"" star-vehicle to screenwriter Mitch ""Scrooged"" Glazer, who never had a fastball."
16338	2	a	It is with genuine sadness to report that Paris Can Wait is a snore.
16339	10	a	upposed to be a horror-comedy film, but it's neither scary nor funny, and it's not much of a film.
16340	5	a	Each woman is a cardboard cutout, and the talented actresses here seem boxed in by their roles.
16341	5	a	Basically, what you see in the trailer is what you get, and nothing more.
16342	2	a	Faults aside, there's something truly revolutionary about this big-screen Romeo and Romeo romance, as Simon courts an anonymous closeted schoolmate he's met online in the hope of one day meeting him. 
16343	5	a	Oh, gee, have I given too much away? Is there something in this lyrical narrative that can't be detected in the first five minutes?
16344	3	a	Now if only we could have found out more about the reproduction of triceratops, we would be more excited.
16345	5	a	It's a lovely message of tolerance, but it's trampled by a script from producer/writer Mitch Glazer that emphasizes lunacy over logic and idiocy over emotion.
16346	8	a	...a wide-canvas drama literally bulging at the seams with big ideas...
16347	1	a	The ending of the show is perfect and shocking if you have never seen it before.
16348	3	a	Colorful, clever sequel tackles complexity of online world. 
16349	7	a	Wrecked beyond any repair.
16350	1	a	A fun, energetic caper that tries hard to make you love its characters, but mostly fails to succeed..
16351	4	a	Shakespeare need not feel threatened by this movie, but 'Letters to Juliet' is nonetheless wholesome TV fare.
16352	6	a	An entertaining trifle to a point...but it doesn't treat the character's or the audience's intelligence with the respect they deserve. By the end, you just don't care anymore.
16353	3	a	"A bizarre, frightening, and clever new low-budget movie with a ""Twilight Zone""-ish premise."
16354	3	a	Turns out- Fincher was right all along. Rooney Mara is a perfect Salander. Her performance, combined with the Reznor/Ross score, makes this a perfect adaptation of Stieg Larsson's entertaining novel. A must-see. 
16355	2	a	Robert Rodriguez brings the same whiplash-inducing pace and ferocious energy that drove DESPERADO and FROM DUSK TILL DAWN to this gentler, but no less high-octane, escapade
16356	2	a	Make no mistake, this is no masterpiece of the dramatic arts but it is probably the best since the original: lean, spectacular, funny and slightly less risible than its predecessors.
16357	6	a	Soars as much as it crashes.
16358	3	a	Snobs will hate it because of its happily ever after ending. Everyone else will love it for the exact same reason. After all, a little fantasy never hurt anyone.
16359	6	a	By trying too hard to stay on this side of hip and the other side of sentimental, Crowe winds up with a zoo that's neither fish nor fowl.
16360	1	a	These people, who start off as caricatures of a generational gap, become achingly real in their pain...
16361	8	a	"With only a couple of artistic virtues and even fewer moral attributes to its credit...""The Expendables"" is wretched."
16362	4	a	Recognized for the splendid landscape photography by Giuseppe Land.
16363	2	a	Fassbender and Vikander light up the screen with their chemistry and talent.
16364	5	a	I hate to side with bottom line-obsessed studio executives, but Dominion: Prequel to the Exorcist is as dreadfully boring, ridiculous, and pompous as rumored.
16365	3	a	Many films are under-written or not well thought out enough, Prestige is the opposite - it's almost too clever for its own good and consequently thinks it can outsmart the audience at every turn.
16366	4	a	The movie goes down much easier than its predecessor.
16367	7	a	An overly gimmicky and fatally repetitive terrorist thriller that quickly wears out its welcome.
16368	3	a	Acting tour de force that feels exceptionally real
16369	5	a	This is Love the Dull Way.
16370	6	a	"If you think ""Predator"" was a silly action movie then ""The Predator"" is an ever sillier film, if not just downright stupid. "
16371	2	a	From the outrageous fashions to the less than hidden anti-media agenda, this revamped version of The Most Dangerous Game is like a retro Running Man meshed with a Cinzano ad.
16372	0	a	Rarely does a film defy both expectation and convention to such powerful, borderline-poetic effect.
16373	9	a	This messy blend of silly slapstick and oversentimentality probably won't please children, teenagers or adults.
16374	3	a	The entire movie is a trigger alert, a comedy where a girl sets her safe space on fire.
16375	6	a	Rubbish CGI, rubbish acting, rubbish storytelling. Throw in a few mutants and a better-than-it-deserves cast and you get this sci-fi timewaster.
16376	7	a	Lord knows we need to laugh about politics, but when it comes to salving our Oval Office wounds, Welcome to Mooseport is like taking a baby aspirin for pneumonia...
16377	4	a	Thankfully, the cast raise it above Hallmark standard, especially Jackson with a performance that proves he doesn't have to bring down great vengeance or furious anger to grab your attention.
16378	6	a	Offering nary a moral lesson to be learned, the streamlined story zips from one joke to the next with welcome space for left-field absurdities and a casual momentum even the godawful musical numbers can't entirely neuter.
16379	8	a	"Think ""Billy Elliot"" combined with ""The Last Emperor"" and a touch of ""Rocky."" Great movies transport the audience - and this left me enriched and exhilarated."
16380	3	a	Think of it as an art-house film that everyone can enjoy.
16381	6	a	more successful than any of the cons on-screen is the con Hustle plays on its audience,
16382	5	a	This is lazy and wholly undeserving of the audience it cynically seeks.
16383	2	a	The crazy glue that holds Invictus together is the beyond flawless performance from Morgan Freeman as Mandela. His performance is better than the entire movie.
16384	3	a	There are some enchanting aspects in Enchanted -- the most enchanting being Amy Adams.
16385	6	a	It's sharpest take on the characters ... is that Tigger is the absolute worst.
16386	8	a	The only thing The Road Chip accomplishes is making three previous Chipmunk comedies look not as abysmally bad by comparison.
16387	4	a	There's authenticity as the teenagers feel tempted and/or trapped, and adults sometimes do more talking than listening.
16388	4	a	Swashbuckling, intergalactic fun.
16389	2	a	If you are a fan of David Cronenberg, you should include [Cosmopolis] in things to watch list.
16390	2	a	Soderbergh knows precisely how the formula works: likable leads, eccentric supporting characters, a complicated plan, unexpected glitches... 
16391	5	a	Squeezing every bit of originality out of its concept, Hancock fails on so many levels that it's surprising the film isn't a bigger success with audiences.
16392	4	a	"The dialogue sometimes gets so silly and redundant when trying to push Bunny Rabbit's talent that I expected to see Waterboy's Rob Schneider pop out and shout ""You can do it Eminem""."
16393	3	a	An age-old story is played out among the cinders.
16394	1	a	After showing the audience how much Alice has to lose, the film shows her losing it. Julianne Moore's finely honed, affecting performance makes her an Oscar frontrunner.
16395	9	a	"The To Do List"" is a romantic comedy with no romance and little comedy, but with an ugliness of spirit that's surprising and unrelenting."
16396	9	a	The comedy, for lack of a better description, is not funny. It is churlish, childish and petulant.
16397	6	a	The movie is no better than something designed for a direct-to-video release.
16398	6	a	Feels like a television movie with a fouler mouth.
16399	0	a	[Jones] lets it all loose here. It's the performance of a lifetime: full of menace and venom, eloquence and fire, rot and pathos, crackling rawness and realism.
16400	4	a	It's a neat, tidy, tightly wound little horror picture with a single-minded intent to startle you out of your seat while causing you to laugh immoderately.
16401	3	a	As for Smith, he's on fire. There's nothing like a star shining on his highest beams. You follow him anywhere.
16402	5	a	The movie is decent enough, but contains Greene's story in a sentimentalised career arc.
16403	3	a	By its very nature, the resulting film is severely compromised, but still rip-roaring, unpretentious entertainment.
16404	4	a	Despite the movie's rather unoriginal story -- that age-old plot about running off to the join the circus -- at least the filmmakers have created something which, though a little bland, is never crass or vulgar.
16405	6	a	Cold Creek Manor is bad on purpose. It's just not bad enough.
16406	9	a	Why do screenwriters demean women in these movies by having them find these lunk-headed doofuses so attractive?
16407	5	a	Despite attempts at freshening up the material, it comes off stale, another plodding historical drama that is far too familiar to be truly exciting.
16408	2	a	"The Rover"" is bleak and gorgeous and has a soulful center thanks to Pearce."
16409	6	a	A better title might have been Jesse James in the Age of Pop Therapy.
16410	3	a	It turns out that skipping a 'blowout' garage sale she was planning paid off for up-and-coming actress Taraji P. Henson after all, she told HollywoodChicago.com in a Chicago interview after netting her Benjamin Button role.
16411	4	a	There are tears aplenty before the three plot strands are brought - rather too neatly - together.
16412	1	a	This victims-of-circumstance crime yarn betters the book in a number of ways
16413	8	a	We may not have seen the end of this nascent franchise, but the beginning leaves depressingly little hope for improvement.
16414	7	a	While the film easily straddles the lines of good taste, Carey doesn't push the limits enough to deliver on its 'good girl gone really bad' premise.
16415	6	a	A third of a million may be dead, but for our purposes, all depends on the survival of these young women, and the redemption of the alcoholic American. Do you get my drift?
16416	0	a	A devastating dissection of a man who's forced out of his arrested development and into adulthood by extreme tragedy and the responsibility that comes with it.
16417	3	a	Rousing conclusion of the trilogy following through on several character arcs.
16418	5	a	Of course, he learns a Lesson about the error of his ways and learns something resembling humility, but by that point, after all he's done, it's too late. He's just insufferable.
16419	2	a	The acting is good, plot holes many and concession stand just down the hall.
16420	1	a	American drama doesn't get any more meaty and muscular than this.
16421	5	a	A white-savior showbiz fable of a particularly dubious and retrograde variety.
16422	9	a	Am I the only one who expected Connery to say, when he starts kissing Zeta-Jones then stops, 'You do realize I'm old enough to be your grandfather?'
16423	9	a	As dire a cum-com as ever shot its load on a cinema screen.
16424	6	a	A horse opera with a hex.
16425	2	a	The movie runs on the fuel of sly intelligence, not to mention a healthy skepticism about mankind's ability to achieve anything that might be called progress.
16426	4	a	a potentially sensationalistic film that has become--for lack of a better word--boring.
16427	0	a	I don't think two minutes went by where I wasn't laughing out loud.
16428	1	a	everything about it is great
16429	6	a	It fails because it neglects to create characters we care about.
16430	3	a	That the final rap battle feels so electrifying rather than merely coming across as the usual rah-rah climax taps directly into the energy emanating from Eminem as he gives his character a real presence.
16431	5	a	Filled with literal and metaphysical stone throwing between the religions, Agora is saddled with a muddy narrative and too many blokes who look alike.
16432	4	a	The script is hopelessly light on narrative momentum
16433	4	a	"It's a clever look at how we struggle to do our best in life and relationships. Although sometimes the drama feels rather too wilfully ""normal""."
16434	5	a	This adventure drama about a group trying to survive in the Gobi desert is filled with nothing but hot air.
16435	3	a	...isn't quite the instant classic everyone was hoping for; it is, however, a better-than-average horror film...
16436	5	a	Dirty vegetables.
16437	2	a	I love the way Campion lets the camera rest on an image. Especially when the image is Aussie dish Cornish, who plays Keats' starry-eyed admirer. Has an actress ever been photographed so flatteringly and at such length?
16438	2	a	Stallone and crew deliver a hard-hitting, unrepentant action extravaganza.
16439	6	a	The movie's excellent design and mood almost -- almost -- outweigh the stupid story.
16440	5	a	Director Bryan Singer has put together a fairly workable, old-fashioned second world war movie.
16441	5	a	Strictly one-dimensional in terms of characters and storytelling.
16442	1	a	Memoirs of a Geisha may be culturally inaccurate and a bit pulpy, but so were some of the best movie-romances ever.
16443	3	a	Extremely clever social satire buried in a rip-roaring action movie that isn't afraid to get squirm-inducingly gruesome.
16444	4	a	It's all perfectly passable, but rather perfunctory ...
16445	5	a	The movie is at least a bit less annoying than director Alex Proyas' previous two genre attempts.
16446	6	a	The slapdash and vulgar second half ... saps the good will engendered by some funny gags and heartthrob Josh Hartnett's ... heart-tuggingly earnest performance.
16447	3	a	Massively underrated.
16448	8	a	As sorority party filler or a double bill with the likes of Cruel Intentions, this movie can't be beat.
16449	6	a	It's a Western, really, but then most cop movies are, these days. I guess it's cheaper to film in a city. 
16450	3	a	Even with its inconsistencies, the movie offers enough suspense to get airborne.
16451	4	a	While absorbing and never dull you can't help feeling the horrific subject matter deserved rather more subtle handling.
16452	0	a	Action- and creature-packed Potter sequel.
16453	1	a	Apart from the sunshiny ending, brains are all over the place in both respects in Land of the Dead, a fine example of hard-R genre fun. 
16454	4	a	Much of what made the first film so enchanting remains firmly in place, from the strong ensemble performances through Stuart Craig's magnificent production design.
16455	6	a	Without any creative and obviously setting up for a long franchise, The Darkest Minds looks like a bad pilot for a series. [Full Review in Spanish]
16456	4	a	A brutal and violent film that breaks some of the rules that we expect from crime thrillers. NO COUNTRY is gripping, but it goes for the gut instead of the head.
16457	3	a	Charming, bantery thriller is made by and for die-hard fans.
16458	3	a	A tremendously stylish, intelligent retelling of western myth.
16459	5	a	Clint Eastwood's late life/late career fascination with mortality, death and grieving devolves, at long last, into a cheap parlor trick in Hereafter.
16460	3	a	If not a masterpiece of thespianism, it's at least a fun ride through Smith's quirky mind and the lives of his unique characters.
16461	6	a	A vital yet thorny approach whose inconclusiveness is bound to sadden or infuriate anyone who's lost a loved one to AIDS.
16462	1	a	This many-faceted time capsule sheds little light, but buried inside it are vexing questions and the still-beating heart of a special creature.
16463	2	a	It's a big, beribboned heart-tugger of a movie and Dujardin, who won the best actor award this year at Cannes, is a charming mimic of silent-film physicality.
16464	1	a	Sharif is a joy.
16465	3	a	Affecting chimpanzee docu is more than monkey business.
16466	3	a	Deliver Us Evil is more terrifying than any horror movie, because it's about something that really happened.
16467	0	a	Indeed, within the framework of this film it truly is no country for old men, and as that harsh realization presents itself the only emotion left is a form of quietly overpowering devastation.
16468	9	a	And I take a page from Ann Miller and say it's all a load of horse-puckey.
16469	0	a	That rarest of cinematic treats, an entertaining and stimulating movie, with a superb script, rich characters and a cracking cast.
16470	3	a	Another successful wild ride, thanks to a very entertaining source, a keen and fairly faithful adaptation, and top-notch special effects.
16471	6	a	Will click with audiences seeking substanceless diversion, or a change of pace from year-end heavyweight titles. Those who prefer to be challenged will stay away, wisely.
16472	8	a	"Max Payne may be the worst movie of the year. The ""may be"" qualifier is only because the year isn't over yet."
16473	6	a	A comedy doesn't necessarily need to develop its characters past caricatures, but a better balance between narrative and yuks tends to make the yuks stronger.
16474	3	a	Serves as a powerful condemnation of any organized religion that aspires to governance or allow clerics to preach contempt and whip sheepish followers into a frenzy.
16475	5	a	"It's a slack but competently executed film of a script with butterknife-dull dialogue and actors cast because of their ""type."
16476	7	a	A dud from Seth MacFarlane.
16477	0	a	As a snapshot of middle American impotency on an epic scale, it's a bizarre and intimate vision conjured here.
16478	2	a	It's obvious that director Michael Lehmann wanted to have a good time with this film, and I for one, enjoyed it on that level.
16479	4	a	An unstoppable throwback to the days of Rambo and Commando; a time when heroes cracked wise, shat bullets, and blew-up a thousand faceless enemies before breakfast.
16480	6	a	Loyal fans may enjoy the temporary reprieve - - but I doubt any others will be won over.
16481	2	a	Kudos to the director for making it as oddball as it could get away with.
16482	5	a	Kasdan's film reveals itself as a pooch-whisperer gloss on The Big Chill...
16483	3	a	It's clean, has all the requisite eye candy and slapstick for the younger set, and -- most distinguishing of all -- an uncommon level of sophistication for the adults.
16484	3	a	Roll Bounce drags a little in its second hour, but it is also a rare movie that genuinely likes its characters. You will too.
16485	6	a	It doesn't transfigure the world. It embalms it.
16486	5	a	The work of a filmmaker so convinced of his own hipness and secure in his cult status that he needn't concern himself with such niceties as clever writing.
16487	4	a	All of the film's characters, and all of the performances, are touched with the kind of unexpected sensibility and decency that are rare in most films of this genre.
16488	0	a	"Haynes maintains the film's temperature at a low simmer and expertly brings it to the boil, but while ""Carol"" builds to a scene of intense eroticism, it's mostly about all the things you can't reach out and touch."
16489	0	a	As Andrei Rublev's narrative and themes pose us a challenge, so too does its climax.
16490	1	a	Days later I was still thinking about this adventure... a sure indication of a well-crafted film.
16491	5	a	Kickin', jabbin' Chuck Norris actioner. Stick with reruns of his TV fare.
16492	3	a	Immensely satisfying on nearly every level.
16493	9	a	The cascade of coincidences and logical lapses drains it of excitement and leaves it seeming overwhelmingly ridiculous.
16494	3	a	Achieves the authenticity of something that the History Channel would be proud of.
16495	4	a	It's like a screwball comedy written by the existentialist Jean-Paul Sartre.
16496	4	a	Anthony Hopkins nails the look and sound of the director, but the film itself is uneven.
16497	4	a	A small, richly nuanced, engaging piece of romantic fluff with a decent sci-fi tinge that doesn't overplay its quirkiness.
16498	3	a	[Paul] McGuigan allows his characters their dignity, and his actors the opportunity to suggest rich inner lives for their creations.
16499	6	a	The mountain-rescue movie Vertical Limit doesn't just operate at the height of ludicrousness; it also puts marshmallow Chris O'Donnell in the business of saving lives.
16500	8	a	Since it's too much a crowd-pleaser to be critical of the violent payoff that it delivers, it's tough not to take its apparent message seriously.
16501	6	a	The filmmaking fails to draw this material together in a cohesive way, and the resulting fragmentation feels more like a side effect than a skillful style choice.
16502	10	a	It's the funniest American comedy since Graffiti Bridge.
16503	5	a	a simpler disappointment than Sunshine State, with its obvious political statements and shallowly drawn characters
16504	3	a	Goldberg and Parker are extraordinary.
16505	6	a	When Luzhin's old chess teacher shows up, the movie becomes a slow-motion wreck.
16506	2	a	A surprisingly entertaining movie that possesses the trademark Disney magic while administering a few well-deserved jabs in the ribs at the same time.
16507	3	a	It won't hold everyone's attention, but it's not often that you can hear a pin drop in the cinema.
16508	6	a	Fassbenderand Vikander, who fell in love during the making of the film, fully commit to their roles and hold us in their grip. The movie, sad to say, can't keep its head above water.
16509	1	a	...this fourth entry in [Van Sant's] impressionistic reveries on death [is] the purest artistic achievement in his experimental mode of filmmaking...multi-layered and mesmerizing.
16510	4	a	From a Clint Eastwood directorial, one expects better. Alas, this one is relegated to being merely an experiment in casting.
16511	3	a	John Carter is a fantastic fusion of old-fashioned adventure excitement and modern blockbuster spectacle. In short, it's wonderful. 
16512	6	a	Instead of a really good villain, you get...'I'm shooting you because it says in the script I'm supposed to shoot you now.'
16513	3	a	Though Meet the Parents features a capable supporting cast, the laughs come almost exclusively from the tussle between Stiller and De Niro, and both deliver.
16514	5	a	Death is never final so long as the box office and foreign market sales remain relatively strong, thus we have yet another devastation destination in time for the end-of-summer theatrical doldrums.
16515	3	a	The bottom line, of course, is Will Smith who carries the film and salvages things even while the story falls apart all around him. The guy has charisma to burn, and makes Hancock appealing
16516	0	a	Three Billboards lands somewhere near Coen brothers country, eloquently finding comedy in horror and vice versa.
16517	3	a	The film's climax delivers and delivers and just keeps topping itself, making it possibly the most satisfying experience since cheeseburgers after a very big night.
16518	0	a	Sublimely romantic and subtle.
16519	5	a	For all its gender-bending intrigue, this is a cataclysmically sexless film: seldom has drag felt like such a drag.
16520	4	a	Perhaps there were insurmountable legal restrictions. But the movie still serves as a dandy primer for rediscovering a lot of great music.
16521	4	a	...more than a bit silly compared to its immediate predecessor.
16522	3	a	As good as the acting is, it's music that propels this story of life cloistered in the Blue Ridge Mountains.
16523	3	a	Moore's performance is gutsy, subtle and Oscar worthy
16524	4	a	The draggy ones make you restless while the best ones, like the movie's title ingredients, provide a buzz that doesn't last long enough.
16525	4	a	The Predator is a flawed actioner, but a strong cast and some Shane Black magic give it a sparkle that has been lacking from recent attempts to revive the killer aliens.
16526	8	a	Disney's latest update of the lame live-action B comedies that have been among the studio's more dubious contributions to American pop culture.
16527	5	a	[Gervasi's] Hitchcock goes only a step beyond caricature.
16528	3	a	Crimson Peak gets under your skin and crawls away with abandon. It leaves you alarmed, unsettled and in a giddy state of cringe-in-your-seat squirm.
16529	1	a	This is a sharp, funny, touching and utterly winning slice of New York.
16530	0	a	John Williams's Oscar-winning music and the excellent performances of Roy Scheider and Richard Dreyfuss add to the ingeniously mounted tension that cleverly plays on all our deepest primeval fears.
16531	3	a	A brilliantly plotted, smartly directed, fiendishly entertaining merry-go-round.
16532	5	a	If this is Brokeback Mountain director Ang Lee's attempt at comedy he should stick to heavy drama.
16533	5	a	It's a snapshot of the kids of today, overlaid with the filter of a somewhat more grownup sensibility.
16534	3	a	This courageous film gets right up in the face of suffering and it doesn't flinch.
16535	3	a	It's a heartbreaking performance by Moore, who never forgets she's portraying a woman whose professional success has been built on intellectual rigour and self-discipline. 
16536	3	a	The film's comedy is loose and generous, and its esprit de corps sneaks up on you with a soft tread.
16537	4	a	After setting the scene with vivid characters and some insightful interaction, the plot of this teen comedy-drama feels like a let down. 
16538	6	a	Russell flings ideas, but only sprinkles plot, at the question, and most of them stubbornly refuse to stick.
16539	3	a	DePalma, a director who chooses his projects carefully, has scored again.
16540	9	a	Leering, witless sex comedy
16541	9	a	A crashing bore.
16542	0	a	A future classic.
16543	6	a	It just feels tired.
16544	9	a	"...and still we wait for that one great ""killer bats"" movie."
16545	1	a	The performances are uniformly excellent...It's intelligent and has a certain grace as well.
16546	3	a	It plays like a cross between Home Alone and The Breakfast Club. Pre-teens are sure to have a great time, and accompanying adults will, too.
16547	5	a	The film is at least half-an-hour too long and is often as dull as Will Smith's repulsively silly Wild Wild West.
16548	5	a	Been there. Done that.
16549	4	a	Heist film with reliable plot. Teens OK.
16550	3	a	I loved The To Do List. It just made me so happy to see a movie embrace the humor of sexuality, and manage to not overdo it on the gross outs.
16551	4	a	Strong performances and beautiful cinematography elevate The Light Between Oceans, yet soap opera contrivances and uneven writing hold it back.
16552	4	a	Shanghai Noon is a fun outing, filled with stunts and gags that will please Chan fans. It's not art, but it is entertainment.
16553	5	a	Gordon is lost, and his style of shooting - telescopic close-ups, which never give us enough space to appreciate the performers - feels wrong for comedy.
16554	3	a	From the perspective of pure entertainment, Alfie is never boring and always easy on the eyes.
16555	3	a	One of the scarier movies of the year.
16556	0	a	This is one of the most powerful and emotional films I have ever seen.
16557	9	a	One wonders what this cast could have done had they been given some real material to work with.
16558	6	a	Mom and Dad Save the World, which was directed by Greg Beeman and has the straggly feel of an extended Saturday Night Live skit, boasts unusually inspired production design.
16559	5	a	I doubt that American Dreamz is much smarter than what it's satirizing. It hasn't earned the right to scorn.
16560	6	a	Frothy doc on the iconic fashion designer Valentino.
16561	5	a	Hereafter is the perfect example of an intriguing concept in need of some collaborative brainstorming between a talented writer and a visionary director, followed by a few rewrites.
16562	3	a	Adults and slightly older children should have a great time.
16563	4	a	The filmmaking choices Eastwood has made here range from merely misguided to numbingly dopey. 
16564	2	a	A Private War is a harrowing biopic that confronts the casualties of war with Rosamund Pike delivering one of the best performances of her career.
16565	0	a	A difficult, long, sometimes brutal work that truly justifies the term 'epic' -- not in the overused sense that has come to mean big and loud -- in both vision and execution.
16566	0	a	"In the immortal words of Wayne's World: ""You'll laugh, you'll cry, you'll hurl."
16567	4	a	Whenever the movie teeters on the edge of poetic madness-like when Manduca voices his belief that Theo represents the redemption of the white colonials-Guerra's commitment to thesis is there to pull it back into the literalism.
16568	5	a	The bottom line for this movie about drugs? Just say no.
16569	3	a	Elegantly, confidently made, though it's so similar to the Swedish movie it does seem kind of beside the point. 
16570	3	a	Lee's contribution should fit well into the Woodstock-tribute canon. It smartly avoids overused period references.
16571	4	a	Although it works in as a pleasantly mindless thriller, the film never reaches its full potential because it can't decide what it is ultimately going to be about.
16572	5	a	All too familiar as a political satire.
16573	7	a	"Lake City"" is a throwaway film with a cast it doesn't deserve."
16574	0	a	Perfect. Simple as.
16575	9	a	"While individual actors can be amusing, especially among supporting players, ""I Give It a Year"" is thoroughly tone deaf. I wouldn't give it five minutes. "
16576	5	a	poorly written, and worse, it's ugly to look at
16577	4	a	Seinfeld the professional cynic has become Seinfeld the environmental crusader. Who'd have thunk it?
16578	5	a	Shoestring special effects and flimsy storytelling make Mutant Chronicles a B-movie fantasy in search of an old Times Square moviehouse.
16579	0	a	I could spend many more hours with these people, who are warm, funny, lived-in personalities existing in a plausible sphere outside the contrived story mechanics of many similar movies.
16580	7	a	At least Seth Rogen has the good sense to wear a mask for much of The Green Hornet. If I'd made this movie, I'd want to hide my face too.
16581	3	a	Well acted, but not often believable, dysfunctional family drama.
16582	3	a	Transposing the milieu from glitz to grits . . .it does more set an intricate heist flick in the back roads of Appalachia, it also makes a sly statement about class, culture, and our preconceived notions about those two things. 
16583	1	a	Rich and strange mystical film that is filled to the bursting point with dream images and bizarre characters.
16584	4	a	It's only a notch above the routine, and it obeys all the conventions of its tired formula, but it also tones the anarchy with a serious edge and it works a surprisingly effective vein of race-relations satire.
16585	9	a	Everyone involved is so clearly phoning it in that you can practically see them checking their wallets to make sure that the paycheck is still there.
16586	4	a	... witty and surprisingly complex ...
16587	6	a	Geriatric hi-tech action-packed spoof caper film that starts out semi-believable and ends on an unbelievable low point.
16588	4	a	A delicate, tender tale about how a good father can show up at unlikely times, bridging uneasy cultures -- and in doing so help a fragile bud of a boy bloom.
16589	4	a	Writer-directors Glatzer and Westmoreland have written a rich, multi-layered screenplay that works equally well as family melodrama and as a meditation on language, identity and mortality.
16590	4	a	Another Hammer vampire flick. About average for the series.
16591	6	a	All of the jokes are obvious, some are funny and none are what you would call inspired.
16592	6	a	The pic is closer to the PlayStation experience of Gran Turismo than to a movie. This is not to say that it isn't fun, only to say that it is more about sensation than sense.
16593	5	a	Daft battles aside, the film soon takes a predictable turn towards family togetherness and bonding, which is cringing but morally commendable all the same. Ultimately this is a bearable if forgettable film.
16594	10	a	The next time the chipmunks make something together, I hope it's a fur coat.
16595	4	a	Binder tackles some very tough material here in a very thoughtful way, even if it falls a little off-balance. 
16596	3	a	A delectable confection.
16597	5	a	As it stands, the film can best be described as a gorgeous, convoluted mess.
16598	1	a	'Quantum of Solace,' was a dour, dire letdown. This picture's a substantial bounce back, and easily the best Craig Bond picture. Emotional depth and all.
16599	4	a	It works - kind of - but it takes its sweet time in getting there and leaves little behind truly worthy of remembrance.
16600	5	a	Reasonably entertaining as long as you don't attempt to take any of it as seriously as it takes itself.
16601	4	a	Its status as a low-budget cult film seems secure. I just don't think it's as good a film as it might have been with more restrained storytelling or art design.
16602	2	a	West in a repeat performance of her stage role is magnificent.
16603	6	a	It's more of a 'smile' film.
16604	0	a	Milos Forman's opulent drama is sheer quality.
16605	2	a	A frighteningly good horror movie with enough solid scares to freeze the blood of ardent fans and newcomers alike.
16606	5	a	"For all its plagues and protracted problems, ""Jane Got A Gun"" is not the calamity many expected. But it is so buckshot-impaired that its wobbly steps falter often and it never gets a head full of steam. "
16607	3	a	A movie that will capture the attention of anyone who remembers what it was like when music was a crucial component of their daily existence.
16608	1	a	It's an exhilarating original.
16609	3	a	Genuinely gripping, Demi makes an awesome femme fatale.
16610	3	a	Bolt is a good but not great film which should earn Walt Disney Animation a deserved hit even if it won't quite return them to the heights of their own creative and commercial heyday.
16611	3	a	This is exactly what animation should be about, presenting us with a thrillingly imaginative adventure that is utterly liberated from trivialities like the laws of physics and possibility.
16612	1	a	A vivid, powerful attempt to get close to one boy's tortured soul.
16613	5	a	A colossal bore.
16614	1	a	A rural, podunk masterpiece.
16615	4	a	The script ... is crisp and fresh, the gags well-aimed and nastily barbed.
16616	3	a	Werner Herzog's Bad Lieutenant remake is a hugely entertaining, brilliantly directed and completely insane thriller with a hilarious script and a gloriously bonkers performance from Nicolas Cage.
16617	6	a	Despite having a few 'wow' moments, this is one of the more frustratingly inconsistent movies in recent memory.
16618	4	a	Plenty here to enjoy if you're a fan of trips outside of the norm. 
16619	6	a	Tina Fey grounds the movie in something real, something urgent and human, and she nearly single-handedly saves the movie from itself. The movie itself isn't particularly serious, but she sure as hell is.
16620	4	a	Funny, handsomely shot and has some really creepy stuff involving reflections in mirrors -- but it's also packed with a few too many false scares, obvious red herrings and mayhem you can see coming from a mile away.
16621	6	a	Romero may have enhanced the scale of his production, but not his iconic status in the zombie-making hierarchy.
16622	4	a	Spain's best-known living director Pedro Almodovar ranks among the modern masters of melodrama -- as he demonstrates once again in Broken Embraces
16623	3	a	The biggest achievement of Call Me by Your Name is that it manages to depict something universal about first love and first loss...
16624	2	a	What is terrific about Eastwood is that he has a real cleanness in his approach to filmmaking and there isn't this claptrap of sentimentality surrounding it.
16625	9	a	A stultifying blend of The Texas Chainsaw Massacre, boot camp, and maybe The Blair Witch Project, Wrong Turn is profoundly less than the sum of its influences.
16626	4	a	Martin Landau, as the washed-up Bela Lugosi, makes the picture come alive; unfortunately, the last half falters without him.
16627	3	a	With a passionate zeal and the budget to back it, Mel Gibson has created a religious epic which is equally unique, inspirational, and repellent. 
16628	7	a	Reminded me of The Jerky Boys Movie. Not right for film.
16629	5	a	Mildly amusing but wholly unnecessary.
16630	2	a	If you were lucky enough to grow up near the woods, you'll see how true the movie is to the tenor of adolescent exploration. This is a kid's film in the best sense of the word, not a movie for kids, but a great story about being a kid.
16631	6	a	Picture an overbearing, overweight Jack Black running around in his underwear, not once, but several times in this film. Sound inviting?
16632	5	a	A disappointing film that never finds its right tone
16633	0	a	[R]uns deep with sadness...
16634	0	a	... this is as visually and sonically gorgeous as anything Almodovar has ever done.
16635	0	a	It's completely irony-free because it's so convinced that it has something potent to say.
16636	4	a	It may not tell you who you should vote for, but Team America: World Police conclusively proves everything is funnier when it's done by marionettes.
16637	3	a	While the pacing of the film is deliberate and the presentation frequently abtruse, the stunning compositions, elaborate camera movements, compelling performances -- provide ample reward, if you are willing to make the effort.
16638	3	a	It's an exquisitely crafted melodrama, moving with stately grace toward an understated yet forceful quest for revenge.
16639	5	a	The Lazarus Effect is one of those horror films where lack of character logic makes it hard to root for the bodies that are inevitably going to pile the floor.
16640	2	a	Disney gambled on the whimsical but oddball idea of catapulting a rickety old boat into space. And on some levels, it works.
16641	9	a	"It makes such gumdrops as ""The Devil Inside"" and ""The Last Exorcism Part II"" seem borderline competent by comparison-that is, if anyone watching it could stay awake long enough to make the comparisons."
16642	4	a	Like some marriages, it has its flaws, but perhaps it's the good stuff that's worth focusing on.
16643	0	a	Violent, poetic, gripping, thrilling and blackly funny: that'll be the Coens doing what they do best then. Now with added humanity.
16644	4	a	The Infiltrator is a stylishly crafted and well-acted dramatic thriller, but breaks little new ground despite fascinating subject matter.
16645	4	a	All you have to do is get past the clumsiness of Lon Chaney, Jr., in the lead role, and you're off to enjoying one more of Universal's dependably enjoyable monsterfests.
16646	6	a	Tremblay's work is so strong, so subtle, so natural, it's as if he's in another, much better movie.
16647	3	a	Even people who reject the idea of inherent evil may be shaken by Berg's scrupulous yet passionate recounting of the story of Oliver O'Grady.
16648	4	a	This movie was a nice try.
16649	4	a	"Strange and a little awkward, ""Secret Window"" nonetheless is worth a look."
16650	4	a	A laugh-laden road fashioned for fans with just enough character work to make Ted a bong-buddy to care about in between all the jokes about pornography, sex, prostitutes, pot smoking and Comic Con.
16651	6	a	Agreeable but disappointingly bland...
16652	0	a	Loose, sleazy, brilliant and hyper-cool.
16653	3	a	As Mandela, Morgan Freeman is suitably statesman-like and makes light of a difficult accent to give a convincing performance. Less convincing but still serviceable is Matt Damon.
16654	5	a	[It's] a spectacular mess - thoroughly uneven in its plotting, filled with character touches that aggressively strain credulity and performances that sacrifice naturalism and authenticity in favor of an abiding artifice.
16655	3	a	Russell has created another film that is a joy to watch from beginning to end; he uses his considerable talent stockpile in front of the camera to weave a story that is funny, dramatic, and laughs at itself all at once. 
16656	8	a	A funny, powerful, flashy, tragic film that plays with your perceptions and with your preconceptions about movies and society.
16657	0	a	The franchise has refashioned itself by never once forgetting its glorious history, including a certain 'Goldfinger' car.
16658	4	a	Achieves a degree of grace, goofiness, and agreeability that can often be lost in the serious drudgery of everyday life.
16659	6	a	Does a satisfying hatchet job on the spooky ... world of supernatural pictures.
16660	1	a	A handsome and stirring film of Second World War ingenuity that also succeeds as cracking good entertainment.
16661	3	a	I, Robot is not as nerdy as it sounds ... It's one of the most interesting films of the summer
16662	5	a	Feels like four different movies, which don't fit together and could probably have used some streamlining. 
16663	5	a	The execution is so pedestrian that the most positive comment we can make is that Rob Schneider actually turns in a pretty convincing performance as a prissy teenage girl.
16664	3	a	Sometimes too overblown, surreal and obtuse for its own good, director Paolo Sorrentino's film is nonetheless an exquisitely composed portrait of vapidity and decline.
16665	3	a	Christian Bale makes a powerful central figure in this disturbing corporate nightmare.
16666	4	a	Cranston is eminently watchable as the in-too-deep cop risking his family life for the thrill of the job.
16667	3	a	...short on logic and certainly short on plot, but long on thrills and amazement.
16668	4	a	Martial arts saga mixes soap opera and sword-fighting action that will appeal to anyone who loved Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon.
16669	6	a	The stories are uninvolving, often too brief, and they quickly grow tiresome and repetitive.
16670	1	a	The film unfolds like an epic poem, and like Longfellow or Yates the imagery catapulting it across decade-long stanzas fly by so quickly the whole thing is over almost before you know it.
16671	4	a	The actors ... bring a so-so script to life.
16672	4	a	A muddled morality tale.
16673	6	a	It's a pic that delights in being so ridiculous and corny.
16674	4	a	[Westfeldt] makes a promising directorial debut with this good-natured dramedy, boosted in large part by an outstanding ensemble.
16675	3	a	Sausage Party is like a Pixar movie that's gotten hopped up on crystal meth and Viagra.
16676	3	a	Lancaster-Curtis saga of Manhattan's amoral media has spark and a wicked bite.
16677	3	a	In the midst of unthinkable brutality, Zhang has found a savage poetry, not to soften the horror, but rather to compel the audience to watch it without being able to turn away. Using his trademark fascination with satu
16678	5	a	This time out, there's not much out there to look at besides sand, and even it doesn't look real.
16679	1	a	...[an] intimate glossy project with a solid purpose...[a] compellingly warm and intuitive narrative...imaginative and inherently heartfelt
16680	2	a	...an enjoyable little genre picture -- tense and stylish and full of Johnny Depp. 
16681	5	a	...remains virtually intolerable throughout its overlong running time due primarily to star Robin Williams' relentless mugging and writer/director Barry Levinson's inordinately mediocre screenplay.
16682	9	a	Who needs real actors when all Clint Eastwood wants to make is propaganda?
16683	1	a	It makes us happily remember the movies we thought Allen wasn't able to make anymore, even while the filmmaker reaches into the past to add one more great one to the list.
16684	3	a	Sweet, funny romantic comedy for mature audiences.
16685	4	a	As crass and foul as it may be, in this age of low-brow comedies, this is nevertheless more intelligent and witty than most.
16686	3	a	It's hard to say how much of the paunchy Wuornos is actually Theron and how much of it is prosthetic.
16687	5	a	Not merely bad but pretentiously bad.
16688	9	a	Oh, man. Man, oh, man.
16689	5	a	The adventures that youngsters act out on the french fry-littered seats of the family minivan will surely be more exciting, and more imaginative, than the film itself.
16690	6	a	Depp has a wonderful time as the Earl, and why wouldn't he? The movie plays to his deepest boyish desires to jump into the dress-up box and emerge with a frilly shirt and one of Mom's discarded wigs.
16691	3	a	Nolan's most perfect commentary on his favourite auteur theme of mise en abyme, as both magicians in their own ways make near Faustian pacts for their climactic 'prestige'.
16692	4	a	For all its roiling tensions, Jindabyne is an oddly antiseptic, even repressed, experience.
16693	4	a	Interesting, uneven fantasy marred by Lewis' inability to edit himself.
16694	4	a	See it for the cool action scenes, and call it a night.
16695	4	a	At least Vardalos didn't put herself on Larry's ride. It's enough that the fuel in the tank is low test at scooter speed.
16696	5	a	Most of the humor is about as fresh as the air left behind whenever Witherspoon uses a toilet.
16697	3	a	Guns and deep thoughts make this best for older kids.
16698	6	a	One failing in the film is how boring it is to watch Cruz pretend to be a bad actress. The comic movie within a movie, which borrows from Women on the Verge, isn't funny.
16699	2	a	For all of its filthy tirades, Knocked Up is perhaps one of the more sentimental and honorable morality tales this year, featuring more educational value and entertainment than all of the after school specials in the world.
16700	2	a	The Final Destination series caters to its target audience without insulting it -- which is why the flicks make so much damn money.
16701	5	a	Basically recycles all the old, tired cliches that abound in every story about the rise to stardom of poor but talented youngsters who overcome terrible obstacles in their drive to succeed.
16702	1	a	It hits you like a ton of dope
16703	6	a	I've never played the game. Hopefully it's more fun. 
16704	3	a	Ralph Breaks The Internet is a welcome return for Disney's most unlikely band of misfits, but the style, tone, and creative components all breath life into this turbo charged satire that knows never to take itself too seriously. 
16705	1	a	Less a movie involving a specific state and more a film evoking a specific state of mind.
16706	5	a	I have no idea why studio executives think Mann is a go-to-guy for summer fare. He's so serious and so concerned with setting a scene and establishing grit that his movies lack coherency or, far more important, fun.
16707	9	a	Never before has one script screamed so loudly for a Carrie Fisher rewrite; anything at all to inject a little wit, decency or soul.
16708	3	a	"For all the movie's honesty, the reality of Alzheimer's disease is a lot worse than what you see in ""Still Alice."" Perhaps directors Richard Glatzer and Wash Westmoreland made a calculation as to how much an audience can take. They were right."
16709	3	a	Shows that the most effective antiwar statements are clothed in humor and irony.
16710	9	a	Pure sitcom fluff, a silly story about a romantic triangle [in which] wit, charm, style and comic timing are all absent.
16711	6	a	Serious Tezuka fans will likely appreciate the sharp multi-dimensional presentation, even as they resent Osamu's being pimped out for Obama.
16712	1	a	With a ton of heart, sentimentality, and a huge emphasis on friendship, The World's End puts a spin on the imperfections all humans have and delivers a film that is near perfect because of it.
16713	5	a	Superheroes' origin stories are inherently background-heavy, but director Tim Story and screenwriters Simon Kinberg, Michael France and Mark Frost spend too much time on setup.
16714	0	a	'Divertida, honesta y extremadamente inteligente, es un claro ejemplo del nivel de arte que puede llegar a alcanzar el cine. Sencillamente inolvidable'
16715	3	a	Twisty courtroom drama about the dangers of capital punishment.
16716	5	a	Good message, bad comedy.
16717	7	a	A hybrid of Hallmark Hall of Fame and Glee, Lemmons' muddled adaptation is neither fish nor fowl, a filmmaking choice that denies Black Nativity much of its emotional potential.
16718	2	a	The star of Miami Vice is, of course, Michael Mann, whose manipulation of this material is by far the most compelling reason to see the film.
16719	5	a	Larry's routine becomes considerably more embarrassing the longer it continues.
16720	0	a	Gladiator has the distinction of being both timely and nostalgic.
16721	4	a	A minor Greek tragedy transposed to colonial Brazil.
16722	3	a	Delightful enough to earn the buzz.
16723	0	a	Since The Artist can't speak for itself, let me sing its praises instead.
16724	0	a	Anchored by the wildly charming Dujardin in the lead, The Artist is so warm and entertaining, it will leave you speechless. And smiling.
16725	2	a	"If you're in the mood for an old-fashioned, historical melodrama, this is a schmaltzy, sorrowful, heart-wrenching ""weeper."
16726	4	a	A little coarser, a little more desperate and a lot less funny than its predecessor. But Dustin Hoffman saves the day.
16727	4	a	It isn't afraid at all to take the immaturity of college partying and break it down to the simple fact that deep down, it's full of stupidity on both genders
16728	0	a	It is arguably the best motion picture ever made about the process of creation and the creator.
16729	4	a	As syrupy as it plays at times, it did spawn the genre of Obsessed Stalker movies, and showed the first signs that Eastwood could do more than act.
16730	3	a	Imagine Mel Gibson playing the James Garner role in The Great Escape. Now, imagine Mel Gibson in feathers.
16731	4	a	Bryan Cranston and John Leguizamo's excellent characterisation saves this crime drama from stewing too much in its rather obvious plotting.
16732	1	a	To borrow a phrase the film's con artists are prone to saying, American Hustle works from the feet up, and the fun is intoxicating.
16733	5	a	There's something tired and rotten about this Fugitive send-up right from the start.
16734	0	a	The studio would like to sell a candied inspirational story, but director Joe Wright avoids the sugared path at all turns, producing a stunning, transcendent celluloid event.
16735	3	a	To absorb the extraordinary details, colors, shapes and situations that are rife with layered danger is to witness this director's fierce commitment to his own vision.
16736	6	a	A bittersweet curtain call for the late Philip Seymour Hoffman.
16737	8	a	McDonagh draws the authentic, angry response our world creates every minute of every day. He provides a damning treatise on twenty-first century rhetoric spewed in blood.
16738	3	a	Italy has never looked so inviting.
16739	6	a	He's the Good Coach; he knows these young men will lead good lives as long as he doesn't relent. Odd then, that the end doesn't seem like the result of a lot of hard work.
16740	4	a	It helps that Roberts rides all the turbulent waves with such ease and such grace, that Jenkins knows exactly what to do with his internal churn, and that Bardem can do no wrong.
16741	6	a	Just an Alien knockoff, albeit a serviceable one.
16742	2	a	Somehow, within its messy, sprawling, good-natured excess, it manages a semblance of order within the chaos.
16743	3	a	Columbus carefully avoids overly replaying the visual wonders of his first episode, and heedfully edits and amplifies Rowling's story for the screen, preserving its spooky darkness.
16744	5	a	Romero is more interested in Technicolor gore effects and in young people shooting big guns than in telling a frightening story.
16745	2	a	Features a fine mix of several generations of comic talent plus a terrific soundtrack from its stars.
16746	5	a	The plot is paper-thin and too much of the comedy is reliant on the one-note battering ram that is Rebel Wilson.
16747	1	a	It's as if Murray opens the front door to his psyche wide and lets the whole neighborhood in.
16748	7	a	A protracted and only sporadically imaginative menu of ways to be murdered.
16749	3	a	Slow but mesmerizing.
16750	5	a	the makers of Hitch - a film that overstays its welcome by a good half-hour - seem to be the only filmmakers in Hollywood to not know how to put together a fast happy ending
16751	4	a	It gave me at least eight good laughs - mostly from set pieces that had nothing to do with the story. Your mileage may vary.
16752	6	a	full review at Movies for the Masses
16753	1	a	It's not a pleasant movie, but The Rover twists genre tenets to expose the need for connective tissue that lies somewhere beneath the dark depths of men's souls.
16754	8	a	Cobb turns into a noisy, cantankerous buddy picture.
16755	5	a	Almost worth it to see Macauly Culkin's demise. Almost.
16756	4	a	Only the most ardent Jarmusch fan will be able to suspend disbelief, and the movie turns into an exercise in ideas rather than an excursion along a stable narrative route.
16757	7	a	About as moving as a month-old Kleenex.
16758	4	a	Bogged down by a somber tone that makes its slight story feel interminable.
16759	3	a	Ibrahim transcends the cliche with the delicacy of the two central performances.
16760	2	a	The monster pic manages to be funny and clever, and deservedly has become a cult classic.
16761	3	a	Some of the detail about Felt's private life feels like a distraction but this is mostly a solid, absorbing political drama.
16762	4	a	What can be said is that von Donnersmarck, who shot so claustrophobically in The Lives of Others, does know how to shoot wide to capture beauty and opulence as well as action.
16763	6	a	Reenactment cinema...On balance, Hitchcock is about as entertaining and as trustworthy as a tabloid.
16764	4	a	Martin Lawrence is a talented comedian, but too often he gets stuck with creaky material, such as the script to this mediocre action comedy.
16765	6	a	The sizable laughs in Little Man make it better than just about anyone expected.
16766	0	a	Yes, it's as entertaining as you have heard. Maybe more so. Raiders of the Lost Ark is, in fact, about as entertaining as a commercial movie can be.
16767	6	a	Despite a cast enhanced with notable players -- Dustin Hoffman and Barbra Streisand come on board as the elder Fockers -- the movie has few new jokes to tell, offering little more than slight modulations of familiar scenarios.
16768	6	a	I'd venture to say it's the best Final Destination sequel - if you gauge success by overall shock value.
16769	6	a	Pretty to look at but there's not much under the hood in this Isaac Asimov-based futuristic murder mystery...
16770	9	a	In Hannibal Rising, the bad Dr. Lecter finally enters the pantheon of movie monsters for real: Like Freddy Krueger and Jason Voorhees, he, too, now has a sequel that's been made strictly for the sake of a buck.
16771	1	a	Bill Murray is perfectly cast and his performance is understated, like the entire film. He deserves an Oscar nomination.
16772	4	a	It's very much Annette Bening and Jamie Bell's film when all is said and done, and they are stunning in it.
16773	1	a	The tension Shults builds is incredible, nearly unbearable in the most-satisfying way.
16774	4	a	As you can tell, Mark Felt didn't lack for intriguing material. Just intriguing execution.
16775	3	a	Extremely well made character film which plays just as good as a comedy.
16776	5	a	It's sad in the extreme to see a behind-the-scenes cast of thousands, well hundreds, combining in an attempt to turn visual effects and animation into pure, innocent magic, and failing miserably.
16777	2	a	Ah, that lovable B-movie sci-fi crap from the early eighties.
16778	1	a	Reward the studio for making an intelligent film about intelligent persons in sad circumstances that keeps you engaged.
16779	4	a	A swirling, big budget film that sometimes gets in the way of Rachel Weisz's excellent playing of the woman who ought to be better known.
16780	0	a	Silver Linings Playbook is always interesting and full of humanity in all its shades. It has plenty of black humour and it's superbly acted.
16781	3	a	The beautiful thing here is the way Sound City enlivens some fairly snobby ideas about the glories of analog tape without resorting to mere mansplaining.
16782	5	a	A movie that can't make up its mind if it wants to be urban poetry or a silly soap opera.
16783	5	a	Seriously irritating.
16784	3	a	Generally effective spy thriller with interesting cast
16785	4	a	Just funny enough, just romantic enough and just satiric enough to be good.
16786	3	a	The Artist is at turns funny, heartbreaking, thrilling and a visual marvel with only the aid of Ludovic Bource's sublime score to guide our reactions.
16787	3	a	Less a portrait of the Titanic than a snapshot of those obsessed by it.
16788	6	a	It comes up short in both plot and quality.
16789	3	a	This slight biopic isn't as good as any of the master's films, but it's worth seeing for the performances by Anthony Hopkins and Helen Mirren.
16790	4	a	It's Adams who casts the spell.
16791	7	a	Devil's Due is the latest entry in the found footage horror genre, and while it does have its fair amount of creative visual effects, the thrills are hardly thrilling in this paint by numbers occult chiller.
16792	9	a	Over and above the charmless subject matter, the movie is ferociously badly made and edited.
16793	8	a	If it weren't so grotesque and repugnant, the consistent misogyny of Joe Eszterhas' movie scripts would almost be laughable.
16794	1	a	As in Rushmore...kindness is the underlying trait of Murray's character.
16795	5	a	You can almost see the strings as the actors are manipulated into position for one more weepy scene.
16796	9	a	A bunch of guys wandering around in the plastic foliage of Disney's Jungle Cruise ride pretending to see monkeys.
16797	5	a	Curiously lacking in energy, which may be the result of an obviously cut-rate production budget that skimps on the sci-fi sizzle.
16798	7	a	If unmodulated decibel level and childish, dorkish energy alone could lower a city's crime rate, then consider the cartoon bad guys of cartoon Los Angeles flattened.
16799	0	a	For all its dizzy detachment, the film packs an insidious emotional wallop, one that may not be felt until well after impact.
16800	4	a	A tasty diversion.
16801	7	a	Instantly forgettable and proudly lazy, Strange Wilderness feels like it's being made up on the spot.
16802	6	a	A movie with such a promising concept, so poorly executed, that it begs to be remade.
16803	2	a	...a conventional yarn of salvation and redemption that benefits most from a daring, no holds barred performance by Christina Ricci.
16804	1	a	The film's good heart keeps it from ever making fun of Muriel, although there are moments that must have been tempting.
16805	3	a	The Coens imbue this simple tale with their trademark quirkiness and wry humour.
16806	3	a	It is a pleasure to see such a tight work from Amaldovar.
16807	9	a	In this field of endeavour, any intense reaction is unsustainable, for the obvious reason that the guiding principle of repetition comes with an inevitable corollary and unavoidable side-effect -- sheer boredom.
16808	3	a	Listen to Common's track over the final credits. This movie is continuing a conversation that America cannot ignore.
16809	4	a	Messier than a raging kegger, but game leads and a high gag-count keep the comedy-sequel comedown at bay. Just.
16810	5	a	The most endearing terms I might come up with for this film are 'dorky' and 'cute,' but 'cute' is never what a superhero movie aspires to be.
16811	2	a	Superior western, with a liberal slant, based on the novel by Elmore Leonard.
16812	7	a	As Swede, McGregor evokes an overwhelming sadness that deepens until he seems to become an emotional black hole from which no lightness can escape. 
16813	4	a	It's the kind of movie that smiles blandly at you because it can't think of anything smart to say, and so you smile back, content but not intrigued.
16814	0	a	a truly classic, timeless film, one of the few that quite simply never grows old
16815	6	a	The romantic comedy genre needs infusion of new blood, but this film is utterly predictable, by-the-number, thoigh Will Smith has charm. 
16816	3	a	Sensitively, slowly explores the interplay between a living, breathing muse and an inspired artist. Quietly makes a Regent-era, circumspect romance palpable.
16817	6	a	A pointless exercise.
16818	5	a	It felt like Van Sant was imagining a nonexistent depth in order to justify his own fascination with Alex and his companions.
16819	5	a	As brilliant as Rock can be, this material is a reflection of his shallow, moralistic side.
16820	6	a	The Infiltrator is one of those movies that is always telling the audience rather than demonstrating to us what the characters are thinking or doing - something that's deadening in a thriller.
16821	0	a	One of the greatest films ever made
16822	3	a	Payne, shooting in widescreen black and white with cinematographer Phedon Papamichael, elevates the material with images, simply composed, of serious and paradoxically ordinary beauty.
16823	5	a	What makes it to the screen feels pretty joyless.
16824	3	a	It's really nice to see him with a budget... Romero's gone and made the zombie version of Metropolis.
16825	5	a	thick, saccharine pablum 
16826	5	a	Would be a perfectly decent B-action movie if it weren't shipwrecked in the last act by laughably ridiculous plotting and a lazily executed climax.
16827	5	a	For the promise it held at the onset and the foolishly inane places it opts to travel to, this is a particularly arrogant letdown, a thriller with a rancid bite.
16828	3	a	It's a lark, if you can tolerate the hammy redneck accents, and confirms that Soderbergh is as agile as ever at knitting together all the moving parts of a complex heist.
16829	3	a	This beautifully designed and photographed period drama, adapted from Andrew Hodges' book The Enigma by debut screenwriter Graham Moore, centres on three important points of Turing's life.
16830	5	a	Almost in spite of itself, succeeds in saying something interesting about its teen audience before ultimately revealing itself to be entirely vacuous after all.
16831	6	a	Waist Deep is a waste of time, and ankle deep at best.
16832	1	a	...Another showcase for Aniston's considerable talent as well as another triumph for [writer] White and [director] Arteta.
16833	5	a	You're tempting fate when you name your movie Failure to Launch. Especially when your movie's as stubbornly earthbound as this one. 
16834	2	a	Napoleon Dynamite isn't exactly the year's funniest film, but it does make for a memorable experience that can be enjoyed over and over again.
16835	5	a	The big battles impress, but become somewhat samey. Part Three is threatened.
16836	1	a	"Slowly, as if in a delicate tango, the two move toward each other, and ""Call Me By Your Name"" becomes the story of a connection, both sexual and emotional."
16837	4	a	Lumet does manage to achieve a certain sarcastic humour. 
16838	5	a	Even in CG-animated form, Nicolas Cage has ridiculous hair.
16839	3	a	A witty, whimsical feature debut.
16840	6	a	Some verbal jokes simply don't work, and Darryl's persistent I-wanna-be-a-daddy musings are more insipid than inspiring. But some of the physical comedy scores.
16841	5	a	...a bunch of mumbo jumbo parading as deep thought, a concept in search of a movie.
16842	5	a	The script here is not funny, while the cast -- though star-studded -- is perfunctory.
16843	3	a	A period romance, charged with provocative undercurrents about art, war and the eternal battle of the sexes.
16844	0	a	One of the great classics of world cinema.
16845	4	a	...glossy and soap-opera-like...
16846	3	a	The vibe is loose-limbed and fluky, and the gags have an extra snap that's recognizably Seinfeldian. If I believed in a sitcom afterlife, I'd swear the whole thing was cooked up by Kramer and George's dad.
16847	2	a	I began to appreciate the neat reversals of expectations, slow pace and serene non sequiturs of the plot, the film's smart approach towards teen alienation, ludicrous ambition and impossible dreams.
16848	3	a	A warm and fuzzy family adventure about why you can't domesticate a sasquatch.
16849	5	a	Both Bateman and McCarthy are funny, but they really don't have much chemistry, which is essential for a road comedy that locks two people in cars and hotel rooms together.
16850	2	a	It's one of those things that probably would have flown under the radar had it not been for Haddish.
16851	5	a	Moan? You're more likely to be groaning - or possibly hooting with laughter at the implausibility of this messy, misogynistic melodrama.
16852	0	a	Cumberbatch's masterful performance dominates the movie, inevitably evoking his updated version of [Sherlock] Holmes... But where his Sherlock is smooth and lofty, his Turing is lofty with rough, jagged edges that keep rubbing people the wrong way.
16853	6	a	A solid cast, but the racial issue is so poorly presented that the film feels unintentionally offensive.
16854	1	a	fun, irresistibly charming and very genuinely felt
16855	1	a	Rango is a precision-built, artistically rich and intelligently entertaining movie that deserves to become a hit and a classic.
16856	3	a	[It is] a tangible and rousing reminder of those rare and fleeting moments when things turn out for the best, and its optimism about finding common ground is contagious.
16857	6	a	As old-fashioned historical escapism goes, this is solid, compelling stuff.
16858	4	a	Loose and limber, proudly R-rated and wickedly amusing.
16859	2	a	An uneven but engagingly quirky comedy-drama driven first by character, second by plot formulas, Cage is surprisingly convincing despite seeming at first like the wrong choice.
16860	3	a	Steven Spielberg's dino-park thrill ride comes up eye-wateringly shiny in this rereleased version - even if its clunkier elements have become a bit more obvious with time.
16861	3	a	I enjoyed every moment. Huckabees is both absurd and densely rich.
16862	4	a	The film ends with an ambiguous, yet powerful conclusion. It doesn't answer the question it raises, yet the way it's asked keeps it echoing in your head.
16863	5	a	Two-thirds of the way through, the heroes and the bad guy all start behaving with offensively unbelievable stupidity.
16864	3	a	the presentation [of mountain music]evokes its deep emotions and a beauty that comes from life experience, not the pre-packaged pap courtesy of slick marketing types.
16865	6	a	Whiskey Tango Foxtrot is an uneven, but otherwise passable wartime comedy/drama anchored by Tina Fey's performance.
16866	5	a	While the first film offered, by my casual recollection, almost two dozen belly laughs, this one barely registers four.
16867	4	a	As a human interest drama, Red Planet is more thin than Mars' atmosphere.
16868	2	a	has the power to enrage and enlighten 
16869	3	a	Resolutely, gloriously old-school in every regard, The Flight of the Phoenix is a reminder that disaster films don't need the threat of global annihilation to be good entertainment.
16870	3	a	Though employing an utterly conventional romantic design, it tweaks the formula sufficiently...to come across as charmingly distinctive rather than tiredly imitative.
16871	4	a	This is twinkly wish-fulfilment on stilts, presumably aimed at The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel fanclub, but it manages some funny jabs at ageism, and it's lovely to see Ardant being funny, vibrant and desirable.
16872	9	a	Battle of the Year is too inept to make this tired premise sing.
16873	5	a	I got very little out of this particular freak show.
16874	6	a	It ticks all the boxes but it feels more like a respectful imitation of an Amblin movie as opposed to one that truly embodies its spirit.
16875	9	a	Relentlessly predictable and painfully unfunny...A total failure.
16876	5	a	I'd rather blame it on the screenplay.
16877	4	a	Ethnic romances from Abie's Irish Rose to Moonstruck have traveled similar ground, but few have handled the role of family in a marriage more poignantly than Once Around.
16878	5	a	you outgrow these arguments--you only hope that the entertainments intended to illuminate as you get more curious have the decency to mature at the same pace
16879	1	a	It's smart enough to keep adults on their toes and exciting enough to keep a kid with a short attention span glued to his seat.
16880	4	a	The Good Girl is a film in which the talent is undeniable but the results are underwhelming.
16881	6	a	Little more than a supersized version of the popular PBS animated series that's stopping briefly in theaters en route to its natural habitat -- video.
16882	3	a	An entertaining mix of Stand and Deliver and Remember the Titans with a charismatic performance by Samuel L. Jackson.
16883	3	a	Produced with a Masterpiece Theater eye for period detail, but also with a missionary's zeal to honor a wrongly dishonored man.
16884	9	a	There's so much bodily waste on screen that the film becomes the cinematic equivalent of a cesspool.
16885	3	a	If you've ever wondered where the Spielberg of Schindler's List came from, look no further than this underappreciated gem - the first real sign that he was more than just a generator of warm fuzzies.
16886	9	a	The stoner duo has done some great stuff in their day; this, however, is the absolute pits.
16887	4	a	Brush aside the crude formula and bathroom humor and you've got yourself a surprisingly delicate social commentary.
16888	2	a	Too bad the film often seems more concerned about its own year-end legacy than its subject's. 
16889	3	a	Though Safety Not Guaranteed is comfortable and pleasing, it's also amazingly fresh, concentrating on its characters and emotions rather than on a collection of visual effects, genre staples, or gratuitous thrills.
16890	1	a	Trey Edward Shults. Make sure you remember that name. Burn it into your brain. It Comes at Night solidifies what a major talent he is.
16891	5	a	"The third outing in the ""Pitch Perfect"" franchise is like a pop song remix that retains some of what you love about the original, while throwing in an out-of-nowhere bridge and an unwelcome guest verse."
16892	3	a	Woody's most inspired comedy in years. Charming, and very enjoyable- even if you're not normally a Woody Allen fan.
16893	3	a	This dazzling and spellbinding tale about the intense rivalry between two magicians in London tutors us in the art of watching closely.
16894	3	a	A Vicodin-coke-heroine habit propels Nicolas Cage's warped detective as the big emoter scores in the Big Easy. Werner Herzog's Bad LT. is genuinely weird entertaiment.
16895	4	a	It is more just a pleasure to watch Eminem perform. He is fiercely talented and has a natural charisma; the camera loves him. But, like most of the story, we knew that before we saw the film. 
16896	9	a	In the absence of such answers, or the intimation of such answers, or even of characters in pursuit of answers, It Comes at Night begins to seem thin, a torment without purpose.
16897	3	a	Charged with exhilarating car-racing sequences, this movie nails the car culture scene and packages it into an entertaining summer movie.
16898	2	a	You might wonder at the end what happened to the plot, but the mood, characters and look are so striking that you really won't miss it.
16899	5	a	The thin comic appeal of Kevin James is laid on a bit thicker in Paul Blart: Mall Cop, his first solo star vehicle for the big screen.
16900	9	a	They don't make them like this anymore... there's a reason.
16901	1	a	It isn't your grandma's gothic.
16902	6	a	There's nothing here but a concept and a marketing and merchandising strategy, at the center of which somebody - oh, no - had to come up with an actual movie.
16903	0	a	If this is the kind of eminently stylish and self-assured work that comes after taking a four-year hiatus from feature filmmaking, perhaps more directors should start looking into extended vacations as well.
16904	4	a	Maddeningly uneven but mildly amusing.
16905	6	a	Ambitious, sprawling and melodramatic, this sword-and-sandal epic lacks subtlety and struggles to provide much charm - ultimately dissolving into a rather obvious morality tale about the rise of fundamentalism. 
16906	1	a	What keeps the film from feeling like period-piece amber... is the keenly feminist sensibility of first-time director Josie Rourke and the fierce charisma and complicated humanity of its two leads, sovereigns till the end.
16907	6	a	Hirsch is excellent as the woefully ill-informed and too arrogant for his own good McCandless, but Christopher is ultimately such an unsympathetic character that it is hard to feel anything for him. That makes it very hard to stick with the film.
16908	4	a	emotionally satisfying for the whole family, as long as you aren't looking for high art or realism
16909	4	a	Grading on the admittedly weak January curve, it squeaks by with a pass.
16910	6	a	Instead of inspired Hollywood Shuffle-style parody, we get caricatures of color and glib riffs about economic insolvency in black America.
16911	4	a	A well-acted, carefully directed yet largely unsatisfying exercise.
16912	2	a	There's no doubting the frenetic energy of Simon Hunter's steampunk thriller with its deft mixing of CGI and live action. The mutants are artforms of grotesqueness and truly terrifying.
16913	3	a	In a summer full of superheroes, dinosaurs and earthquakes it could very easily get drowned out. But try listening a little harder. It has something to say.
16914	4	a	Often beautiful and moving, but emotionally it never quite sticks.
16915	3	a	So the film's visual elements suggest a documentary, but it's a carefully fictionalized narrative. Some folks will thus dismiss it as a fabrication, but it still packs a profound emotional wallop.
16916	0	a	Take the plunge. 
16917	4	a	"Are there any Mark Felts left, and when will they stand up? ""Mark Felt"" is asking that question just as much as it's honoring its subject, but it's not telling anyone to hold their breath."
16918	2	a	"You need good villains in a movie. And if they're named ""Ham Egg"" then all the better."
16919	5	a	Dull and dry.
16920	3	a	The tone is exactly right, and the passage of a few years has been good on everyone's looks. 
16921	4	a	Tom Cruise starring in the fact-based story of a plot to kill Hitler by Nazi Col. Claus von Stauffenberg sounds like Oscar bait. It isn't. And the sooner you accept it, the more fun you'll have at this satisfying B movie.
16922	1	a	I don't remember the last time I just sat and enjoyed the ride of a terrific movie. 
16923	5	a	Elicits a potent desire to sponge off the sleaze.
16924	6	a	It feels like each and every moment bursts forth with urgent dialogue, and yet what does anyone actually say?
16925	4	a	The advance word on The Libertine was so bad that I was rather surprised to find it -- unterrible.
16926	5	a	It's just too bad that Smith wanted to play it so safe and so easy when Hitch could've benefited from a stronger vision and much bigger laughs.
16927	3	a	The whole thing is feverishly earnest and more than a little manipulative, but it's also possibly the prettiest two hours of emotional masochism so far this year.
16928	4	a	The boys don't have much to say but it's oddly fascinating watching them try.
16929	9	a	With clunky bluescreen, spot-a-mile-off matte work and an absolute lack of synergy between real-life and animated action, it all conspires to provide an appropriately amateur sheen.
16930	3	a	It's as crazy as a crackpipe on a kayak, but the title alone proves that this is a hell of a lot smarter than it looks.
16931	6	a	Levinson' sleek, trashy psychological thriller, set in the corporate world, is skin-deep in treating sexual harrassment, but it touches a nerve. 
16932	5	a	The problem that the New Zealand director cannot overcome is that there is the lack of electricity between Ben Whishaw and Abbie Cornish in the lead roles.
16933	2	a	This testosterone-laden tale takes no prisoners. It is full of firey action.
16934	5	a	[The actors] stand around mouthing dry as Martian dust dialogue.
16935	5	a	lame, stupid sequel
16936	3	a	The fanciful flashbacks which are colorful and storybook-like add some magic to the mix.
16937	2	a	Grandiose and visually spectacular, although the visual effects overwhelm the narrative.
16938	1	a	Laced with amazing visual stunts, standout performances, and a perspective of our nation that's nearly incomprehensible, we wind up tramping right along with our wide-eyed hero.
16939	5	a	It's hard to escape the feeling that this is a essentially a small-scale indie project whose deficiencies are magnified by the presence of its A-list cast.
16940	3	a	"Soderbergh's ace-in-the-hole has to be the young Farrah Mackenzie. When she has her big scene, no parent could resist the tug at their heart-strings. More than a heist comedy, ""Logan Lucky"" is an endearing father-daughter love story."
16941	9	a	There I was, trapped in the dark, staring at a piercing light, and feeling the reaper's icy claw fingering my throat. Did I experience the afterlife? No. Just Clint Eastwood's new film about it. 
16942	6	a	With a little more anti-authoritarian spirit, The Perfect Score might have been a rousing call to arms for a whole generation.
16943	4	a	This movie relishes in the awkwardness of starting life in the bottom year of a new school.
16944	3	a	The kids will be just as wild about Harry the second time around, but adults had better be ready to take the multiple-choice quiz in advance.
16945	7	a	This well-meaning but comically limp offering from DreamWorks Animation inspires boredom more than anything.
16946	0	a	It's all about prestidigitation, folks - and Nolan's hugely entertaining film performs the best sleight-of-hand this side of Vegas.
16947	6	a	Feels surprisingly tame thanks to weakened characters and story changes that rob the mystery of much-needed suspense.
16948	3	a	Does Revelations say anything that could be interpreted as 'The end is nigh when Rob Schneider turns into a woman in a movie that's funny, sweet and clever'? If so, prepare to meet your maker, because The Hot Chick is exactly that.
16949	1	a	The Prestige is wonderfully engrossing, darkly mysterious and entertaining from start to finish.
16950	1	a	A delightful family-friendly holiday confection.
16951	4	a	If the structure establishes a calculated distance, the movie's raw materials feel just rough-hewn enough to draw us in.
16952	0	a	When you see No Country for Old Men, leave your preconceptions at home. But bring your Alfred Hitchcock lenses. They're useful. No Country for Old Men is a dazzling time-bomb of a movie. It is an engrossing, brutal, nerve-wracking moral tale
16953	3	a	A hard film to shake and makes us think and think again.
16954	3	a	A wondrously beautiful piece of filmmaking by American director Todd Haynes.
16955	6	a	A monster combat thriller as impersonal in its relentlessness as the videogame series that inspired it.
16956	9	a	This sappy, crappy and condescending chick flick has been slapped together for those wishing to bask in the cinematic afterglow of the ever-radiant Sarah Jessica Parker.
16957	5	a	If Against the Ropes was a boxer, it ... would be a lightweight. The movie spends more time displaying Jackie as a publicity-hungry celebrity ... than as a boxing manager. 
16958	9	a	More idiotic and dangerous than the show. Really.
16959	3	a	"I don't know what's more surprising: that director Gus Van Sant has made yet another movie about the lives of disaffected Portland teenagers, or that he's pulled it off one more time with ""Paranoid Park."
16960	7	a	A high caliber international cast, an Irish television director and a green screenwriter with a marketable ad concept all add up to one big slice of cheese with Vantage Point, a movie that cannot even stay the course with its own story telling devi
16961	10	a	Paranoid Park confirms that Gus Van Sant is so far up his own artistic anus, it's impossible to take anything he makes seriously anymore...a crisp, white hanky doused with cinematic chloroform pressed tightly across the face.
16962	3	a	For those who like their erotic melodramas frosty and lavish, Secret Things is as elaborately whipped up as such treats ever get.
16963	6	a	The usual TV actors -- including some fellow who looks the love child of Tom Cruise and Peter Gallagher's eyebrows -- being systematically offed because they cheated death.
16964	6	a	Messing and Mulroney have wonderful chemistry -- too bad they frequently have it long before their characters should.
16965	3	a	The Prestige is the kind of popcorn movie that M. Night Shyamalan should dedicate himself to making -- a dark, freaky thrill ride, committed to old-fashioned storytelling that doesn't take itself too seriously.
16966	6	a	Madonna still cannot act.
16967	6	a	It's one thing to make a predictable Hollywood movie. It's another thing to make a predictable Hollywood movie based on a fascinating life.
16968	5	a	A two-hour bloodbath.
16969	3	a	This is not some clinical dissection of bygone cinematic techniques; it's a lively, appealing effort that mostly rises above mere novelty.
16970	5	a	A weird and not particularly wonderful animation for children.
16971	4	a	With a little more work this could have been a first-rate thriller along the lines of the Bourne films, because the concept is intriguing and our interest is held for a significant part of the film.
16972	9	a	Hogging the screen in this moronic vanity project, Seth MacFarlane's vulgar but just not funny.
16973	4	a	Initially intriguing and often dazzling, it ultimately drags on too long, with its wonder succumbing to frustration as the minutes drift by.
16974	6	a	After taking in this brainless, by-the-book romantic comedy, you'll need a breath mint just to get the taste out of your mouth.
16975	3	a	... the script is tight enough and moves along with such blazing speed that it suffers from the only failing grace of the original did: can audience members who haven't read the books keep up?
16976	5	a	The screenplay misses a good few tricks and the direction frequently renders scenes too long, taking positively ages to wrap things up.
16977	3	a	This send-up of current horror movies is a go-for-broke hoot, a hot mess of a comedy that doesn't have a lick of sense. And knowing that going in adds to the often knee-slapping laughs.
16978	1	a	The painted backgrounds are lush, realistic, and full of luxuriant foliage. The character animation, while stiff by Disney standards, is appropriate to the characters and expressive enough to bring them to life for the audience.
16979	6	a	You can practically hear George Orwell turning over.
16980	3	a	"All but blows out ""Sixteen Candles."
16981	5	a	Hitch doesn't impress with its sophomoric observations on sexual politics.
16982	9	a	It should come as no surprise that The Angry Birds Movie is a loud and dumb children's film, but for what it's worth, there are plenty of cinematic commercial ventures that are louder and dumber and so on than the well-meaning and slickly sold Birds.
16983	3	a	Veronica Mars, then, accomplishes what it set out to accomplish, and in that sense it can be considered a success.
16984	10	a	Steve Van Wormer and Paul Walker, as Stew and Phil, give lifeless performances. The only actor in the movie with any demonstrable talent is a cute little prairie dog named Petey.
16985	4	a	An intriguing yet erratic effort...
16986	4	a	Hancock is still worth seeing, if only for a glimpse of what might have been a truly innovative idea.
16987	4	a	All in good fun....In the absence of anything better, it's a fine outing for the young'uns.
16988	6	a	Unfortunately, as the film winds to a close, claustrophobic tension once again gives way to overblown digital effects and set pieces.
16989	1	a	Reminds that underneath the legend Martin Luther King was a pure Christian soul, who relied upon and used the Christian faith to battle injustice both on the streets and in the corridors of political power.
16990	7	a	Reign Of Fire should at least be a marvel of special effects, but alas, even the dragon's not very much fun.
16991	0	a	'Our Little Sister' is a tender and restrained feature that flows by like a gentle stream, lulling you with its melodic cadence and drawing you into its beauty.
16992	3	a	Alison Lohman effectively brings out how a teen girl can be both a delight and an albatross.
16993	4	a	Sure, the ins and outs of Psycho behind the scenes is interesting for film fans. But beyond the initial 'gee whiz' factor, the story itself plays a bit soft.
16994	5	a	[A] dumb thriller.
16995	5	a	David Bowers' retro-cool update on the titular icon looks so great, it may take a while to notice it's a clunky political parable wrapped in a tonally confused fairy tale.
16996	4	a	Fine performances and exquisite cinematography, production, and sound and costume design are almost enough to shake off the clingy soapy residue that comes with the romantic drama territory. 
16997	5	a	Has all the old jokes you've seen before, recycled one more time.
16998	4	a	How much viewers enjoy this depends on to what extent they're able to focus on the shining stars at the center while ignoring the narrative debris surrounding them.
16999	4	a	A thoroughly respectable historical re-enactment, though lacking the epic scope and dramatic urgency that would make it a truly memorable one.
17000	2	a	The hills are alive with the sound of rock and roll, and the people of Laurel Canyon are learning new songs to live by.
17001	3	a	An engaging, entertaining glimpse into the lives of musicians nestled in the titular Hollywood Hills enclave.
17002	7	a	Madonna provides the body. The script provides the evidence. Together they prove conclusively that bodies without stories make rotten movies.
17003	1	a	Stressful, dark, and emotionally exhausting, It Comes At Night is a truly haunting experience, and I still can't get the very last shot out of my mind.
17004	3	a	The movie is all character and situation, and contains some of the best performances of the year, especially in the ensemble acting of the four main characters.
17005	3	a	There's a lot to cram into one movie, and Anthony Peckham's script is fairly simplistic, but Eastwood is as skilled a director as any working today.
17006	6	a	It's easy to see how this quirky, offbeat approach could seem refreshing within the rarefied, hermetic atmosphere of a festival. Elsewhere, however, it comes across as amateurish and considerably less charming.
17007	3	a	This fest of violence, breasts, sex, swearing and dodgy plot turns can only be enjoyed if you don't take it seriously.
17008	6	a	My biggest complaint about this latest adventure in Middle-earth is that it is three hours worth of set-up for the next movie.
17009	9	a	A convoluted concoction of shaky hand-held camera shots and stomach-churning edits meant to simulate the feeling you'd get if you were tossed over Niagara Falls in a barrel.
17010	1	a	The place where consciousness runs into itself is where this author reigned supreme, and Krasinski brings Wallace's concentric, self-aware ironies to the screen.
17011	6	a	"The reason it's so hard to immerse yourself in the world of Middle Earth again isn't HOW Peter Jackson filmed ""The Hobbit."" It's WHAT he filmed. "
17012	4	a	One thing that certainly can be said about Terrence Malick's Days of Heaven: it's not sentimental or manipulative. Unfortunately, it's also not particularly involving.
17013	4	a	A quality sports drama.
17014	6	a	Less would have definitely been more in this case; if viewers squint their eyes hard enough, they might just be able to locate a kitchen sink lurking somewhere in the background.
17015	3	a	If you like him on TV, you'll like him here, too.
17016	1	a	Penn and cinematographer Eric Gautier capture with lucid beauty the feel of the road and the vastness of the wilderness.
17017	4	a	The segments featuring real people are genuinely affecting, but the realisation that everything else is probably being acted - that truth may be polluted by hoax - gives this otherwise lightweight film a sly, subversive edge.
17018	3	a	Fabulous entertainment.
17019	2	a	[Lane] sheds Anne's cares away slowly, as if sinking into a warm bath. Filmmaker Viard is a delight as the irrepressible Jacques, a kind and considerate man with a hint of the rogue, a true charmer.
17020	9	a	In which a bunch of macho has-beens and never-weres splash down in the action pond for one last go-round.
17021	5	a	Pretentious tripe from Adrian Lyne with a plotline not unlike the 'surprise' of The Sixth Sense.
17022	4	a	funny and completely twisted
17023	3	a	British filmmaker James Marsh recreates this tale of an ambitious primate language study through traditional face-the-camera interviews, clever graphics and dramatic recreations. A powerful musical score adds gravitas.
17024	5	a	Peter Jackson definitely knows what he's doing. He just didn't do it this time.
17025	9	a	Can they go any lower?
17026	1	a	I've seen the movie twice now and was even more involved the second time, because I was able to pay more attention to the nuances of voice and gesture.
17027	4	a	The story, about a young soldier who is torn between leaving the army and loyalty to his brothers at arms, is affecting and well acted ...
17028	5	a	Trying to figure out who the rat is, is enough of a story line for this film.
17029	3	a	This is more of a thinking man's action flick -- a small, intense film made on a giant canvas that finds Mann experimenting with and pushing at the boundaries of mainstream filmmaking.
17030	3	a	The casting is impeccable, the dialogue raw and the impenetrable Glaswegian brogue is wisely translated with English subtitles.
17031	1	a	An enthralling spy thriller-turned-prestige bio pic that features a world-class performance by Benedict Cumberbatch.
17032	6	a	Are you, more or less, setting yourself up for disappointment if you go to see a film adaptation of one of the most powerfully written novels you can recall reading?
17033	5	a	Unplesant
17034	3	a	The movie seems to be about drug addiction and recovery, but it gradually shifts, becoming a look from an unusual angle at what a big job it is to be a parent and the priorities it requires.
17035	6	a	Grim, dry and pointless, The Rover is a tense thriller set in an Australian wasteland that ends up wasting a terrific performance from Guy Pearce.
17036	6	a	A sedate, simplistic, dispiriting film about chess and madness. 'Searching for Bobby Fischer' is better.
17037	6	a	Shepherd's script ... after going gooey, goes goofy.
17038	3	a	It's about taking a complete leap of faith toward life-altering changes, a running theme in all the director's movies.
17039	6	a	Noticeably disconnected and low on laughs, undoubtedly a symptom of the screenplay's five - count 'em - five different screenwriters.
17040	9	a	The series limps its way to the finish line with a weak, not particularly funny effort.
17041	1	a	Wow -- here's a smart movie that's as well-acted as it is well-plotted.
17042	4	a	Amusing and big-hearted, Soderbergh delivers an entertaining tale of honour among thieves. 
17043	2	a	Pretty fun and takes advantage of its goofy premise in every way it can ... [but] I really don't envy the position this movie found itself in.
17044	5	a	While it invites viewers to ruminate over any number of big ideas, it boasts no crystallizing moment to tie all those ideas together in a satisfying way.
17045	1	a	An extraordinary journey through the complexity of Latinamerican culture. [Full review in Spanish]
17046	4	a	Except for a few lapses, co-scriptwriters Kenny Moore and Towne allow Pre's aura to remain undisturbed by overdramatization and psychological speculation.
17047	4	a	The visuals are stunning, but that's not enough. They can't make up for this predictable story populated by cardboard-cutout characters. The film needs more rescuing than that.
17048	1	a	It's hard to make bits of clay flutter like feathers, but somehow they do.
17049	4	a	...it's about on par with the original but it's so much better than MacFarlane's last outing, the criminally unfunny A Million Ways to Die in the West.
17050	2	a	[Most family films] aim too low, so perhaps there should be hearty applause for one that tries to do too much good in its small space of time.
17051	3	a	Excruciatingly intense and prone to explosions of violence.
17052	5	a	The scenery is fabulous, the script less so, the final action sequences a headlong plunge into hokum and bathos.
17053	1	a	Every once in awhile, a movie will come outta nowhere and blow your socks off.
17054	1	a	Before taking into account anything about its story, characters, or performances, the film is an awe-inspiring technical achievement.
17055	4	a	In this compelling documentary, director Mai Iskander follows three teenage Egyptian boys who eke out a living by collecting garbage, but dream of finding their way to a cleaner, easier way of life.
17056	3	a	James Cameron goes back to the same salty water and makes it fresh. . .Ghosts of the Abyss is a breathtaking success.
17057	6	a	Director Luca Guadagnino has infused Call Me by Your Name with an unhurried and excessively languid sensibility that becomes more and more problematic as time progresses...
17058	3	a	Visually awe-inspiring and groundbreaking.
17059	3	a	Not another teen comedy, thank goodness, but a refreshing comedy of the plight of a clean-cut applicant for college.
17060	9	a	the biggest flaw is what should be the film's finest moments -- the fight scenes...
17061	9	a	indifferent to storytelling, craft and, dare I mention, fresh ideas
17062	1	a	"Writer-director Kelly Fremon Craig doesn't reinvent the wheel by any stretch, and that's a big part of the charm of ""Seventeen."
17063	3	a	As usual, Mr. Eastwood tells his story with a quiet grace and reverence.
17064	0	a	The film actually makes more sense than the noble storybook versions that have been passed on through the years, and in the end, it doesn't betray a single bit of Jesus' message.
17065	4	a	An astonishing blend of dark allure and damaged brilliance, Mara is compulsively watchable as Lisbeth Salander, while Craig effectively embodies quiet integrity as the humiliated reporter fleeing the limelight while sharpening his investigatory skills.
17066	4	a	A thought-provoking portrayal of homelessness and an interesting tale of one man struggling to help another.
17067	4	a	It's hard to shake the sense of well-known figures cashing in on a superhero craze that doesn't quite fit them, and trying to but never fully making it their own.
17068	6	a	Busily adventurous, packed with exotic creatures and boys-in-the-sandbox playfulness, and altogether kind of fake.
17069	7	a	A bit like getting relationship advice from a clown. A really, really unfunny one.
17070	1	a	Norton's performance is just shy of brilliant
17071	3	a	It's smart, frightening and funny.
17072	4	a	Overall, the movie is capably directed, poorly edited, and acted with gusto.
17073	5	a	Absolutely no blame for this snooze-fest can be laid at the feet of the stars, who do the best they can with the rough material they have been given.
17074	5	a	The endless gore and violence make the experience torturous -- and not just for the victims in the movie.
17075	2	a	Its raunch can be appreciated by the younger viewers, the sentiment by the older.
17076	4	a	Philip Seymour Hoffman and Laura Linney are typically superb as a brother and sister brought together to care for their aging father in Tamara Jenkins' acute, if sometimes sluggish, follow-up to Slums of Beverly Hills.
17077	2	a	Most of the time, it's good for a solid laugh.
17078	3	a	Moorhouse gleefully blends laughter and shocks....She works with a scalpel.
17079	4	a	A film by the painstaking James L. Brooks that is so eager to ask the question about true love, it doesn't have time to mess with boring punctuation.
17080	10	a	It is so unbelievably ludicrous that I couldn't help but think that it was intentional despite Rob Cohen's constant attempts to convince me otherwise.
17081	4	a	Broken Embraces is certainly moody, and that's one of its charms. But behind the style is disappointing substance, a melodramatic story that's as old as Hollywood.
17082	9	a	Has a none-too-subtle racist agenda that is thoroughly unfunny and repellent.
17083	10	a	"About halfway through, a sense settles in that something is bound to happen, that it can't just keep going like this, with one town, one meal and one dull conversation after another. But ""Paris Can Wait"" does keep going, and it never gets better."
17084	0	a	Penn and Robbins, especially, are absolutely riveting in this haunting tale of lives lost.
17085	9	a	Mom and Dad Save the World is an insult to the idea of children's entertainment.
17086	4	a	The king is completely out-of-control, and so was Gilliam in making this film. Neither has much of a sense of proportion, but both are hard to ignore.
17087	10	a	One of the worst movies I've ever seen.
17088	3	a	When a crew is given constraints like a miniscule budget, more emphasis rightly goes into tightening up things like scripting and performance. It's the 'Chasing Amy' phenomenon at work.
17089	3	a	...Hardball is much darker and far more adult than the commercials and trailer want you to believe.
17090	4	a	There is quite a bit of solid craft at work in Astro Boy ... but it feels rushed, ill-prepared and derivative. And that's because it is rushed, ill-prepared and derivative.
17091	4	a	In its best moments, the film exudes an almost Miyazakian love of flight, notably during the hero's maiden soar through the clouds.
17092	4	a	The movie...is corny and sentimental, but it set the bar for all future sports pictures.
17093	6	a	Factory Girl is weirdo weary, despite some vivacity spooned into it by Sienna Miller as Edie Sedgwick.
17094	4	a	The acting impresses, the plight of the characters, less rounded and sympathetic than they are in the book, merely depresses. Roadworthy then, but hardly revolutionary.
17095	0	a	Get on out to 'Get on Up', a superb and edgy biopic of the Godfather Of Soul, James Brown. Chadwick Boseman is possessed by the spirit and demons of the man and may be Oscar bound.
17096	9	a	Penn's entitled to his reading of McCandless's story, of course, but envisioning it as a Stations of the Cross with a backpack is bizarre and disrespectful.
17097	6	a	When your straight man gets more laughs than you, it's time to modify your act.
17098	5	a	Josh Brolin grits half his teeth for the whole movie. I just can't tell if he's doing it to stay in character, or because he's disgusted with everyone else's effort in the film.
17099	1	a	While The Jerk is an extremely episodic little movie, that's a malady easily forgiven -- simply because the episodes are so damn funny.
17100	1	a	Refreshingly optimistic without idealization, Jack Goes Boating gives us a fantastic cast and manages to be charming and witty without sacrificing integrity.
17101	2	a	It's not just a kids' movie - it's an animated film that can be enjoyed by a lot of different people.
17102	5	a	Whether Jason X is this bad on purpose is never clear. But one thing's for sure: It never comes close to being either funny or scary.
17103	0	a	The work of a true artist. [Full review in Spanish]
17104	1	a	In a strange way, it's not unlike The Matrix -- only this time the red pill transports you into the futuristic world of sound, rather than a cynical world of two increasingly abysmal sequels. 
17105	5	a	We should yearn for these characters to be blissfully happy together. Instead, we're just too miserable and worn down to even care.
17106	5	a	It's unclear what drew the likes of Billy Bob Thornton, Eva Longoria and Andre Braugher to this tepid grindhouse retread, but at least they liven up the proceedings whenever they're onscreen. Unfortunately, that's not all that often.
17107	4	a	If London in cinders and medium rare sky-diving soldiers can't get you into the cinema, you're probably one of those people who were never fascinated by matches as a child.
17108	0	a	... mix of scattershot humor, battlefield carnage and sentimentality makes us pine for a full-on satire of gonzo war correspondents. Think Joker in third act of Kubrick's 'Full Metal Jacket.'
17109	3	a	Simple, trashy, and fun -- and I'm not just talking about Tawny Kitaen...
17110	9	a	How could a man so adept at comedy, and so savvy in general, be responsible for such a flavorless pile of glop?
17111	7	a	The film's tag line - 'Big Man. Big Plan. Big Mistake.' sums up the decision to make the movie... big mistake.
17112	1	a	The film is filled with astonishing set pieces that violate the laws of nature but are exciting, nonetheless.
17113	5	a	Right from the start the movie smells like a stinker because of its Z-grade casting. Worst of all is Julian McMahon, overacting as a Kevin Spacy-ish Dr. Doom.
17114	3	a	Week in and week out, horror movies cheat us, so it's wonderfully cathartic to watch a bunch of kids cheat death in what turns out to be the best installment yet in the Final Destination franchise.
17115	3	a	The movie is willing to throw practically anything on the screen, and a surprising amount sticks.
17116	3	a	'Logan Lucky' succeeds because Soderbergh shows not only respect for his characters, but reveals their hearts and souls. He gently pushes you to embrace them.
17117	6	a	The documentary stands as a visually candid and picturesque peek into one of the world's most mysterious practices.
17118	2	a	Entertaining, but brainless, popcorn fun.
17119	3	a	Fans of movies like The Wedding Planner and You've Got Mail looking for a charming date movie with lots of laughs will fall in love with Hitch.
17120	3	a	Aniston's performance conclusively proves something she had only hinted at before: She's the Friend most likely to become a bona fide movie star.
17121	3	a	The weakest of the four Harry Potter books has been transformed into the stronger of the two films by the thinnest of margins.
17122	10	a	A movie this cheerful is destined to be awful to audiences over ten years of age...
17123	0	a	Part of what makes No Man's Land so effective is a take-no-prisoners sense of humor that is characteristically Balkan.
17124	4	a	"The central idea in Becoming Jane is that ""Pride and Prejudice"" may have been autobiographical. Not a bad idea, except that the film plays more like a new adaptation of that book than as an outright examination of Austen's inspiration."
17125	2	a	Can a genius and an average Joe pair up and put egos aside to serve mindless adventure? Gondry and Rogen have. 
17126	4	a	Despite all the confusion, it's a simple case of the script being too ambitious. It may emulate a man experiencing flashbacks, but it doesn't help the audience.
17127	10	a	John Carter will be hanging from those man-teets alongside animators for Treasure Planet in the new Disney World attraction: Hall of Disappointments.
17128	6	a	The film tries so hard to be funny, but ends up feeling like a rejected Woody ALlen script idea.
17129	1	a	This is an exhilarating, sometimes terrifying monster of a movie that, once it gets you in its clutches, won't put you down again until the closing credits start to roll.
17130	0	a	Captures a sense of events unfolding in the present tense, in a political and cultural climate as complex, multifaceted and undetermined as the times we live in.
17131	3	a	Ugliness that must be taken seriously
17132	3	a	The film, which reduced a roomful of jaded film critics to tears, could literally make you sick.
17133	3	a	The key to the film's success is its lack of strain. As written by Jose Rivera and Tim Sullivan, this isn't one of those pushy slapstick affairs; it's more romantic than comic, and despite the corn there are no villains.
17134	9	a	By the time Lenni's and Stella's story has played out, the writers must have laid down their pens with a sigh. Even the subtitle guy was probably relieved.
17135	2	a	Yet another post-apocalyptic, dystopian vision, this one from ANIMAL KINGDOM auteur David Michod, nasty, minor and dazzling.
17136	4	a	As a quiet expression of collective neuroses, it must be considered a limited success.
17137	3	a	[A] nifty little thriller.
17138	6	a	The settings are authentic, but the acting comes across fairly flat.
17139	1	a	A Perfect Getaway starts with confidence and rarely steps wrong; it knows exactly where to go and what to do.
17140	4	a	A clever, occasionally amusing and somewhat interesting look at and re-creation of the making of the original film.
17141	3	a	Entertaining and moves nimbly enough to keep your way-back seat from turning to stone.
17142	0	a	A mesmerizing, engrossing and beautifully made cinematic experience, rare as a pink unicorn, that enchants for more than two hours and makes you wish for at least one hour more.
17143	4	a	A nifty little number with a great lead performance from the always reliable William H. Macy.
17144	3	a	By the end of the film, we've more or less given up trying to figure out how the characters are making their deductions; we just have to take it on faith that somehow everyone knows to go to a specific address in Moscow.
17145	1	a	Symbolic martial arts romance...sex and death offer a freedom but also a finality...colorful, sumptuous, and often gorgeous.
17146	3	a	It still stands up as an upbeat portrait of pre-revolutionary Russia, and will have you whistling If I Were A Rich Man for days.
17147	10	a	Would anyone go for a sequel to The Wizard of Oz that catapulted Dorothy and Toto into the world of Once Were Warriors or Escape From New York?
17148	5	a	Tepid romance and sluggish action can't match the beauty of Venice. 
17149	9	a	"I'd pay to see ""Ron White: Health Inspector and his stupid sidekick Larry,"" but Larry alone just cain't ""Get-er-done."
17150	3	a	When a movie is based on a video game, we expect it to kick butt and take names, and Doom does.
17151	0	a	A timeless parable as memorable for its spiritual music as for its moving message about the importance of faith and family. 
17152	5	a	Watch the Cartoon Network show instead, it's more fun.
17153	0	a	Eye-rolling action, needle-sharp in-jokes, engaging characterisations, perfect plotting... The only fault with this movie is one slightly irksome ballad. But even that's not going to stop you floating out of the cinema sporting a big, soppy smile.
17154	5	a	Here, we're trapped with experts shouting technobabble at each other for much of the action...and it's just not as compelling.
17155	9	a	This dunderheaded mix of sci-fi and medieval skull-bashing should have been called Monty Python and the Holey Time Machine.
17156	4	a	This is a critic-proof film. How nice that it doesn't need to be in order to succeed.
17157	3	a	Night of the Comet is that rare movie that's effective as both a science-fiction movie and a parody of a science-fiction movie.
17158	1	a	Galaxy Quest the movie is such a thrill for true fans of Trek and the like because while it does look a bit askance at fandom, it doesn't satirize fans and the objects of their adoration so much as celebrate them.
17159	1	a	If Damon played Harrison Ford's Deckard character in the first film, in the second he's Rutger Hauer's Roy Batty.
17160	1	a	On the one hand, Invictus is a serviceable sports flick, but on the other, it's a heartfelt true story of one great leader's unyielding quest to unite his country.
17161	4	a	I came out of Secondhand Lions feeling manipulated but not minding.
17162	8	a	The most complex film made by Alfred Hitchcock.
17163	1	a	"There are shots so beautiful in ""House of Flying Daggers"" that you want to yell at the projectionist to freeze the film."
17164	4	a	The irreverent duo plays it surprisingly safe here.
17165	4	a	During the obligatory explanation scene in Doom, I was quickly disinterested. I kept thinking, 'Okay, enough talk. Let's start blowing things up.'
17166	1	a	Filled with the kind of funny detail that has become a Pixar trademark.
17167	2	a	Although it ends on a powerful, bittersweet chord, the movie is a bit too determinedly soothing for comfort.
17168	5	a	Heartfelt performances from Robert Downey Jr. and Jamie Foxx can't counteract a lack of narrative focus that prevents the film from taking hold.
17169	3	a	From beginning to end, it bristles with ironies in classic Eastern European absurdist style.
17170	6	a	What light through yonder window breaks? 'Tis the fiery wrath of William Shakespeare, dragged back to this mortal coil to lend his cred to a dreadful chick flick.
17171	0	a	Think 'Casino' meets 'The Grifters,' shot through with a hefty dose of the off-kilter ... and that's 'American Hustle.'
17172	5	a	Eat lots of popcorn to distract you, pray for it to end, and love Richard Jenkins. Amen.
17173	3	a	When sticking with Billy and his inspirational story, director Stephen Daldry hits all the right steps.
17174	2	a	An exciting, thoughtful big-screen adventure that employs most of the same characters and actors as the television series.
17175	5	a	Julianne Moore and Kristen Stewart's artful consideration of familial friction acerbated by disease, and vice versa, nearly saves Still Alice from the banality of its Lifetime-movie execution.
17176	4	a	...Carol comes off as a hollow exercise in style.
17177	0	a	The film's structure demands rational and beautiful segues from the real world into fantasia, a ballet of sensibilities that Jackson pulls off without a misstep.
17178	3	a	The sight of Adams gliding and beaming and chirping in this movie is just about the happiest time I've had watching an actor do anything all year.
17179	5	a	Unfunny standard-issue ethnic mix-'em-up.
17180	6	a	...an incredibly uneven flick.
17181	6	a	...a Will Smith cop picture with the slight novelty of having robots as perps.
17182	4	a	The Ring is worth a look, if you don't demand much more than a few cheap thrills from your Halloween entertainment.
17183	4	a	Not much about the plot can be revealed without giving away the various surprises and twists [which]are the only reason to sit through the film.
17184	1	a	Coming at the end of a summer at the movies that's been apocalyptic in both theme and quality, The World's End feels timely and refreshing. 
17185	3	a	If only Sean Connery had starred in On Her Majesty's Secret Service instead of George Lazenby. If he had and with just a few tweaks, this could have been the best Bond movie in the entire franchise.
17186	6	a	It fails at romance and comedy. It fails to make the lead characters interesting and their love affair believable. And it fails to develop a consistent tone that would enable viewers to suspend their disbelief.
17187	3	a	It's possibly Damon's most impressive major role to date.
17188	5	a	Chugging forward and chundering back, the movie keeps promising to whip up something hellishly complicated, but what keeps the movie going for an hour and a half is not a complicated plot but a stingy way of dribbling out information.
17189	1	a	This film [is] one that must be seen again, if not to better understand it, then to remember the sweet feeling of reveling in its haze.
17190	3	a	A mightily entertaining, oft-cheesy, oft-soaring spectacle packed with more pulp than Florida's finest fruit.
17191	9	a	It's super- violent, super-serious and super-stupid.
17192	3	a	As ever with Zhang, the supposedly heroic action is rife with visual and thematic subversion.
17193	5	a	Should probably have more depth after four decades of reflection.
17194	4	a	Perhaps it is because the film focuses so much on the mechanical and the material that the sudden intrusion of the genuinely magical feels forced and even somewhat silly.
17195	2	a	Craig's most effective Bond movie yet.
17196	9	a	Stumbles every time it attempts to rise above the perfunctory, with its tiresome comic-relief geese and bog-standard internecine rivalry in the wolf pack.
17197	3	a	Quieter and more sensitive than anything else Schrader has directed, with Ethan Hawke giving one of his finest and most moving performances in the lead role.
17198	5	a	A disappointing telling of a heroic story, with a commendable attention to detail highlighting narrative shortcomings.
17199	4	a	Proyas succumbs to the inane post-Matrix tendency to pump up action sequences with sudden moments of slow motion gymnastics that are almost laughable
17200	4	a	...a watchable piece of work...
17201	3	a	A welcome antidote to the US cultural imperialism of countless inferior Disney sell-thru videos . . .
17202	4	a	"James L. Brooks wrote and directed ""How Do You Know,'' and in addition to forgetting a question mark, he's also misplaced his point."
17203	3	a	Ballet has never looked so darn sumptuous and appealing.
17204	5	a	Maybe all those bloody corpses curdle the laughs...in this neo-noir comedy of murders.
17205	2	a	"Wolfgang Petersen may have ripped off ""Die Hard"", but he did his work extremely well."
17206	5	a	You can predict the end of the film in the first five minutes but I will say that the dogs and the gadgets were pretty fun to watch.
17207	3	a	From the very first shot of Skyfall, it's clear that this isn't just another James Bond movie.
17208	1	a	Stark, dark, dramatic and DEEP.
17209	4	a	[Nelson's] movie about morally compromised figures leaves viewers feeling compromised, unable to find their way out of the fog and the ashes.
17210	7	a	Comes across as a weird combination of Charles Dickens and Harlequin Romance, given a falsely exotic air by an overlay of kimonos and cherry blossoms.
17211	6	a	Stylish...sitcomedic...plays it pretty safe. [Blu-ray]
17212	1	a	A tour de farce from France's funniest filmmaker, Francis Veber.
17213	1	a	Rosalind Russell in a brilliant turn as we examine the manic life of an eccentric rich aunt who must spoil her niece at all costs.
17214	3	a	Tension-filled story showing how a diverse population can work together to save their lives.
17215	6	a	There is little, if any, erotic chemistry between Dafoe and Madonna, and, as a result, their sex scenes look more like hard work than pleasure.
17216	1	a	A key aspect of any movie is how quickly it can reel you in. In the case of Skyfall, this box is ticked in the opening few minutes.
17217	4	a	Over long and deeply manipulative, Coach Carter should nonetheless be praised for its far-from-fashionable celebration of personal advancement through academic achievement.
17218	4	a	Dracula goes to the dogs.
17219	3	a	Cobbled together from trusty old parts, Astro Boy manages to stand on its own feet.
17220	2	a	It's a very astute study of the struggles of a young man trying to find out who he is and struggling between relationships -- both conventional and forbidden by society.
17221	4	a	A virtual treasure chest for film buffs.
17222	5	a	Stone, with her dry-ice charisma, does everything that an actress should except connect to whomever she happens to be facing on screen.
17223	4	a	Surprisingly winning.
17224	3	a	One of Hawks' best westerns.
17225	2	a	This film is one of Almodovar's more resolute efforts.
17226	2	a	Here [Bening] nails the part of a flighty, impetuous, tempestuous, needy showbiz type.
17227	3	a	Paranoid Park, while still off the beaten path, is less self-absorbed and pretentious than anything Van Sant has crafted since Finding Forrester.
17228	3	a	Cartoon or not, the world of 'Cowboy Bebop: The Movie' feels as convincingly 'lived-in' as any seen onscreen in ages...
17229	4	a	Ryan Murphy's film adaptation of Elizabeth Gilbert's bestseller about the divorced New Yorker's lone odyssey to Italy, India and Bali to find meaning in her life is a shallow guilty pleasure: an escapist Julia Roberts romance and exotic travelogue. 
17230	3	a	"Midnight in Paris"" finds Allen in a larky, slightly tart and altogether bountiful mood, giving filmgoers a movie that, while unabashedly funny and playful, provides a profiterole or two for thought."
17231	1	a	A road/chase comedy that wants nothing more than to make the audience laugh--and are there ever laughs to be had.
17232	3	a	Just try to guess the nature of the twist at the heart of the drama - I guarantee the truth is more outrageous and disturbing than you could have imagined.
17233	0	a	Terrific tale of romantic obsession that pre-dated Fatal Attraction
17234	1	a	Theron delivers a disturbing portrait of the rage, confusion, despair and self- hatred that fuel so many murders.
17235	3	a	Charming film of a type completely absent these days.
17236	3	a	Selma is about America at its worst -- and very best. 
17237	3	a	A decent thriller that takes time to get started
17238	4	a	When filmmakers re-imagine history, as they did with Becoming Jane and now with The Other Boleyn Girl, affairs of the heart can get dicey. At least Jane Austen kept her head in the process.
17239	4	a	The Rover is more than just the darkest timeline version of Pee Wee's Big Adventure. It's an examination of the human condition.
17240	3	a	The process of figuring out the moment the movie re-imagines the Battle of the Bulge with a bare-chested guardsman and a pike is more than worth the price of admission.
17241	0	a	"First Reformed,"" a mesmerizingly austere drama of one man's apocalyptic crisis of faith, feels like the movie Paul Schrader was put on this planet to make."
17242	9	a	Tawdry and tedious, 'Couples Retreat' is a retread of the almost equally unfunny 'License to Wed.'
17243	2	a	The mainstream rom-com genre is vanilla to the core. Love Simon isn't interested in changing the formula, it's just throwing rainbow sprinkles on top. 
17244	4	a	A nice blast of character-driven nostalgia with the best use of Charlie Murphy and Wayne Brady since Chapelle snapped.
17245	3	a	Sci-fi meets sea-faring fantasy, and the mix isn't half bad.
17246	5	a	Its acrimonious message lies in the way it depicts black oversensitivity and an atmosphere of political correctness as the only obstacles to harmony.
17247	8	a	It makes you want to reach for a can of Raid.
17248	4	a	full review at Movies for the Masses
17249	6	a	The movie offers nothing funny, just a series of sour situations.
17250	4	a	Lovely performances elevate this predictable drama.
17251	9	a	They might have fared better with a filmmaker who actually works with his actors to shape performance and character, something Eastwood has been proudly uninterested in doing for more than a decade.
17252	1	a	Effective, layered, genuinely and intelligently scary, and a fun ride as well. Please read review.
17253	3	a	Brad Bird strays from the Pixar formula but still delivers enough colour and thrills to keep the faithful happy.
17254	4	a	... the bawdy humor always seems to be around to keep things in check.
17255	2	a	Summertime was shot exclusively in Venice. And for those who have been to Venice, the film is a rare treasure;
17256	6	a	I'm not sure what it was trying to deliver, and I don't think director Peyton Reed knows either.
17257	1	a	This is supremely confident filmmaking for a newcomer, and should give Antal a one-way ticket to bigger things. 
17258	4	a	Its plodding, sporadically effective script may not entice much, but it finds a haunting eloquence thanks to Theron's lacerating, career-defining performance. 
17259	5	a	An instruction manual of sorts that doesn't illuminate police corruption and violence so much as it revels in it.
17260	1	a	Inherent Vice isn't everyone's kinda trip, but it is righteous fun for those who enjoy the high.
17261	10	a	Like being trapped at a perpetual frat party...How can something so gross be so boring?
17262	3	a	The movie has the hopped-up, sickening energy of a four-day drug binge, and it's as repellently fascinating as a pulp detective magazine.
17263	4	a	In the film's favour is the fantastic cast, which includes Edward Burns, Kristen Wiig and a particularly on-form Jon Hamm.
17264	6	a	The first half of the film is dreadfully contrived and artificial, from the uneven acting to the stereotype-filled script, to the aforementioned set and production design.
17265	3	a	Despite some minor missteps, watching it feels like welcoming an old friend into your home. He may ramble a bit and slightly overstay his welcome, but hanging out with him reminds you of why you're friends in the first place.
17266	0	a	Visually stunning detective story, and a defining work of science fiction.
17267	3	a	Casting is everything, and the casting of Stallone -- playing way against type -- as the powerless hayseed sheriff in Cop Land is nothing short of inspired.
17268	2	a	That public scandal's cleanup committee... explains more about politics and the Kennedys than [their entire] filmography altogether. [Full review in Spanish]
17269	5	a	It feels both overlong and incomplete.
17270	3	a	Whatever he observed in those true-life figures these roles are based on, [writer/director Nick] Cassavetes sure knew how to apply it to one nasty but exhilarating work of art.
17271	6	a	The movie looks good and seems to hit all the right notes, yet never quite connects or resonates like it should.
17272	3	a	Sun-blaring Newman western; gritty action
17273	5	a	It isn't just that there's something unsettling about a film that aestheticizes a crematorium; it's that there's something trivializing about the very effort.
17274	4	a	A nice leisurely pace.
17275	2	a	Paul Thomas Anderson's dark-comedy adaptation of Thomas Pynchon's crime-noir/counterculture novel is a thing of cinematic achievement. And it's also one heck of a trip, man.
17276	3	a	...registers most strongly as a piece of anti-isolationist propaganda.
17277	6	a	Soul Power leaves you wanting more, and not in a good way.
17278	6	a	"The experience of watching ""James White"" is like being shut up in a small, dark, airless room ... a sickroom."
17279	4	a	A movie that kids would love and adults can watch without getting bored. [Full review in Spanish]
17280	6	a	Check your brain at the door.
17281	4	a	So, how big is Clifford's Really Big Movie? Maybe too big for a toddler's britches.
17282	5	a	This should be the perfect match of filmmaker and material. Somewhere along the way, something went wrong.
17283	6	a	Cusack brings his no-nonsense screen persona to the film but it is left to seething, angry Adrien Brody to overact his way through the role of evil emperor.
17284	5	a	Most reviewers love it. I don't.
17285	3	a	Some are weak, some are superb ... but they get better as they go along, ending with the most understated and touching of all, featuring Taylor Mead and Bill Rice as cultural rebels who've outlived their rebellions.
17286	4	a	I can't call it a success, but it is certainly an outstanding failure, an attempt to broaden the horizons of a stale genre with real discussion of the matters that consume its maker.
17287	4	a	Though funny in places, the film lacks any decent secondary characters... but it's easy to see why Lemmons would decide to keep the camera as much as possible on the two excellent central performances.
17288	3	a	Cars zoom, guns blaze, and the quips fly with wild abandon, but the biggest achievement to be found here is the pairing of Vin Diesel and Dwayne Johnson. About effing time. 
17289	1	a	A foreign director's Lynch-esque/Coen-wannabe POV on a small-town American tragedy, leavened by levity. Vivid and hilarious, it'll encourage you not to take life for granted.
17290	9	a	... wasting an interesting premise and a solid performance by McDormand... [Full review in Spanish]
17291	5	a	It's harmless and pretty and utterly predictable, but kind of a waste of time for anyone who's ever seen, well, any other romantic comedy set in a beautiful location.
17292	6	a	Enough inspirational beats almost make this true story work. The closing-credit images of the real folks involved alone will empty a lot of tear ducts.
17293	2	a	A haunting exploration into men's minds that becomes too much of a psychological study to qualify as accessible entertainment for most.
17294	6	a	[MacFarlane] has leading-man looks, but is uneasy in his first onscreen performance; he practically jabs the audience in the ribs after every gag or punch line, pushing his product like a used car salesman desperate to make a sale.
17295	5	a	A frothy bit of cloak-and-dagger intrigue where the cloak isn't billowy enough to cover the script's multiple plot inconsistencies, and the dagger's about as dull as a butter knife.
17296	4	a	Quietly moving story of a boy dealing with loss.
17297	4	a	Rango'' is a highly watchable but somewhat frustrating mix of sloppy plotting, rascally attitude, and Big Action.
17298	3	a	Ghostbusters is primarily a showcase for Murray, who slinks through the movie muttering his lines in his usual cheeky fashion and getting off an occasionally hilarious crack that proves he's thoroughly enjoying himself.
17299	4	a	On its own simple terms, Flight of the Phoenix succeeds.
17300	1	a	The title feels appropriate because this is a film to be enjoyed as much for its beautiful imagery as its stimulating storyline.
17301	6	a	...feels more like a parody of these movies than a natural extension of the world established in part one.
17302	5	a	"Just Wrapping Up"" any career in comedy is more like it. "
17303	5	a	Imagine watching someone set up an elaborate chain of dominoes with a button at the end. The idea is that the last domino will hit the button. Now imagine the person who set it all up walks past the dominoes and pushes the button, and nothing happens.
17304	5	a	Just another forgettable raunchy humor comedy. [Full review in Spanish]
17305	6	a	Dull, routine, and not much fun.
17306	5	a	[T]hose who want something beyond a paint-by-numbers romance/travelogue... will be disappointed. 
17307	3	a	The script throws out some utterly disarming one-liners and the animation is entirely enchanting.
17308	9	a	It's a bit sad to see this talented, Oscar-winning actor reduced to taking Murphy's cast-off parts, but Gooding does fine with what the movie gives him.
17309	5	a	At once stilted and melodramatic, this is a desperately ill-conceived adaptation of a fascinating story.
17310	3	a	The excellent natural performances by Linney and Hoffman, make this a special film... .
17311	5	a	What Paul Walker needed was a stunt double. To stand in for him the entire movie.
17312	5	a	"While there are many of the right ingredients here -- a likable cast, plot potential, a dreamy English countryside setting -- I still can't say ""I do"" to this fluffy flick."
17313	4	a	There's something deviantly infectious about the twisted joy of revenge.
17314	5	a	"The old-fashioned good intentions of ""Crimson Peak,"" like the house at the center of the film, quickly get swallowed up by puddles of bright red goo."
17315	5	a	Murray has rarely been so charmless in a movie ...
17316	3	a	Literalizes the plot's existential underpinnings, consciously makes the subtext into the headline, and comes up with something unique and occasionally even coherent.
17317	1	a	Gripping film.
17318	3	a	Enjoyable, frequently funny and occasionally subversive comedy with a strong script, likeable performances and some impressively directed action sequences, though it does drag a bit towards the end.
17319	6	a	As successful as the unlikely casting of Timberlake turns out to be, some of Cassavetes' other choices are disastrous.
17320	0	a	It focuses on its own unique voice, and trusts that those who want to hear it will follow.
17321	5	a	The title is irresistible. The movie isn't.
17322	4	a	"Featuring beautiful cinematography that captures the natural beauty of the Rockies and a superlative cast, Lawrence and Meg Kasdan's ""Darling Companion"" is a darling of a film."
17323	1	a	The new version helped me see the soul because, ironically, this rendering is so much brighter. Noir or not, a film you can't see properly is a film you can't fully appreciate.
17324	8	a	You want... a misunderstood masterpiece, but it's really just a mess, albeit one whose unique place in film history virtually assures it its own... Trivial Pursuit question.
17325	6	a	It's not a bad film, but Towne and his star, the charismatic Billy Crudup, never fire the imagination in the way their inspirational, respectful biopic is obviously intended to.
17326	1	a	Think of it as a somewhat less stylish Ed Wood, only about people with actual talent, and you'll be in the right ballpark.
17327	5	a	The laughs don't come fast and furious; they drop in like long-lost relatives.
17328	1	a	It's a bit precious, yes, but its earnestness and joy carry you along, and its climax simply delights.
17329	6	a	Loud, noisy, chaotic and overall unpleasant.
17330	6	a	...a seriously uneven missed opportunity...
17331	5	a	It leaves Jude Law hanging out to dry. He looks like the young Michael Caine, he talks straight to the camera like the young Michael Caine, but this time our hunk has got zilch to say.
17332	3	a	Keating's work continues to improve, with Carnage Park suggesting that he's more than ready to tackle bigger and lengthier shoots - if he chooses.
17333	5	a	If you feel the need for speed in John Singleton's sluggish sequel to The Fast and the Furious then remember: just say no.
17334	1	a	It's a lovable Woody at the top of his game.
17335	5	a	After its promising liftoff, Final Destination loses altitude fairly quickly and ultimately doesn't get very far.
17336	9	a	This is the sort of monumental cinematic disaster that could only be made by talented people comprehensively bungling things.
17337	3	a	The corrupting effect of absolute power and the disruptive effect of fine cleavage.
17338	5	a	"If you've never seen a ""Frankenstein"" film before, stick with the classics and pretend this one stayed as a graphic novel."
17339	4	a	Shot in luminous black-and-white in the Colombian Amazon, Embrace of the Serpent looks like a series of animated photographs torn from the colonial explorers' journals that inspired it.
17340	1	a	The performances truly stand out, led by Tom Cruise and several members of the supporting cast.
17341	5	a	Call me picky, but I need my thrillers to thrill me.
17342	5	a	I'd rather watch hand puppets deliver clever dialogue than watch the most cutting-edge supercomputer-generated non-humans mouthing dull, uninspired nonsense.
17343	0	a	Top-drawer genre filmmaking -- an intense, intelligent, exciting, impeccable spy thriller.
17344	3	a	The degree of realism is going to terrify actors, although it's interesting to see the likes of Steve Martin, Vin Diesel and a particularly impressive Garrett Hedlund all rising to the occasion.
17345	8	a	A Laurel and Hardy film would have looked like deep sardonic humor compared with this sophomoric effort.
17346	4	a	It's both a lesser Shane Black movie and a lesser Predator movie, but it's still a Shane Black Predator movie. 
17347	2	a	Kore-eda is one of the most optimistic and humanist filmmakers working today, and even though Our Little Sister isn't quite as finely articulated as some of his previous work, his core compassion for humanity comes through clearly.
17348	3	a	There's absolutely no arguing that it comes from the same mentality of test-marketing and formula and commercial calculation as most American animation does right now.
17349	4	a	It's noted as the first American production to be shot in Red China.
17350	4	a	It's hardly a relatable scenario but there's something compelling about it all the same as these two not wholly sympathetic characters try and have their cake and eat it.
17351	4	a	It's a view of the West beyond the myth that's worth enduring, if not relishing.
17352	1	a	The movie pulses forward relentlessly, and the tension never slackens.
17353	5	a	"Albert Nobbs"" is noble and well-intentioned as can be but in the end, it is all for naught and as much as it pains me to say it, it truly is a drag."
17354	0	a	Wonderfully evoking the feel and spirit of the era, this is one of those rare movies you live through rather than watch.
17355	2	a	It's a collection of guy humor, no more and no less.
17356	0	a	I have no idea how it'll play for people unfamiliar with Smith's work, but I rolled with it.
17357	4	a	a budget affair that exposes the generally sad existence of the Bedouins while providing a precious twinkle of insight into their lives.
17358	3	a	A holiday standout.
17359	4	a	In its best moments, the film deploys an inventive range of flashbacks to the first film to show the extent to which nostalgia exerts its grip.
17360	3	a	Malle has a real knack for showing off the nasty side of humanity
17361	6	a	A disappointing failure of tone, a lush and overblown self-indulgence in which David Lean has given us a great deal less than meets the eye.
17362	5	a	Bearable, but mostly middling
17363	3	a	Bleed For This takes its lumps and earns its respect like a good boxing drama should.
17364	5	a	Cocooned in so-hip-it-hurts smugness, these faux-fairy tales perpetuate the sophomoric notion that deadpan quirk and snark are just cover for all that's really warm and cuddly and true.
17365	6	a	The Way Back fails to connect on the all-important visceral, emotional level.
17366	6	a	There are few things more boring than cool. Cool keeps to itself; cool doesn't reveal itself. For cool to be cool, it has to be part of a larger story. Here it's not.
17367	3	a	Equal parts uplifting tearjerker, odd-couple comedy, and righteous screed against abuse of power in the name of religion
17368	3	a	Hoffman is a lovely fit as one of Le Carre's dilapidated, disappointed anti-heroes, whose post-ideological bafflement regarding the point of what he's doing feels wholly convincing.
17369	0	a	Fifth time's the charm.
17370	4	a	A gag-filled chuckler with talent to spare.
17371	3	a	This family film is fun, but essentially paint-by-numbers.
17372	0	a	This is bravura filmmaking, steeped in rich storytelling and tense moments that I will never forget.
17373	3	a	A powerful, incisive, often very funny look at aging, ailing family dynamics, superbly acted by two of the best in the business.
17374	1	a	An incredibly fascinating, star-making film that never fails to intrigue.
17375	5	a	The Sunday Times war correspondent Marie Colvin gets the prestige biopic treatment in a film that boasts a fearless performance from its star, Rosamund Pike, and yet is undercut at every turn by a risible and self-defeating screenplay. 
17376	3	a	Terrific performances make mature musical biopic memorable.
17377	9	a	The sour taste that Body left for [director] Edel is evident in his next, very different big screen feature: the children's fantasy The Little Vampire.
17378	7	a	What starts out as a decent thriller soon winds up plummeting to the ground, brought down by its own improbable plot twists and illogical storyline.
17379	7	a	It wasn't the incessant bleakness that bothered me, but the lack of a compelling reason to endure it.
17380	3	a	Skyfall epitomizes what a Bond movie should be, and its director, for once, justifiably deserves much of the credit.
17381	3	a	Nadine is by turns endearing and infuriating, and while Edge of Seventeen ends a little too neatly, it's a lovely comedy that really captures the wild unpredictability and melodrama of the teenage state.
17382	8	a	A leaden, dull, and generally forgettable piece of barely there filmmaking that might well have been a mid-Eighties movie of the week, or, more likely, a jettisoned ABC After School Special.
17383	5	a	[A] sappy and superficial adaptation...
17384	3	a	Enjoyable threequel which delivers handsomely on the demands of the franchise: an attractive cast, inventive direction, a dark sense of humour and increasingly nasty death sequences.
17385	3	a	Armstrong's subsequent sojourn in Hollywood never yielded a film as engaging and passionately felt as this, her brilliant feature debut.
17386	5	a	A recruitment pamphlet would have proved more effective than the latest army propaganda for theaters from acclaimed director Clint Eastwood. [Full review in Spanish]
17387	4	a	Lame plot and overall weak impact.
17388	4	a	"The World's End"" is more frantic than funny, but it's still funny enough-just-to outweigh its own silliness."
17389	2	a	You'll ultimately have been captivated and entertained enough to conclude that Jane Got A Gun was more bullet than blank. 
17390	1	a	Written, filmed and acted with real beauty and skill. And it has something powerful to say about today's celebrity-obsessed culture.
17391	9	a	Is it a spoof, or is it just stupid ... or is it a stupid spoof?
17392	4	a	Shlocky, brainless shoot-em-up fun that's almost as much fun as playing the game it's based on. Probably. 
17393	0	a	Treasure Planet is the rousing action-adventure Disney tried and failed to produce in last year's Atlantis: Legend of the Lost Empire.
17394	4	a	The film often looks lovely. But all of that loveliness is a cover for a creaky narrative.
17395	6	a	The acting and dialogue and story are all good, but somehow the whole thing feels really poky and tentative.
17396	4	a	a thoroughly unoriginal, but fast-paced and entertaining genre B-flick
17397	8	a	Every scene looks like it was thrown together in two sloppy takes.
17398	0	a	"The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo"" will leave its mark on you. Dark, brutal and intriguing, this version is as troubling and memorable as its Swedish counterpart. Its disturbing tone begins in the opening credits and continues to the last frame."
17399	5	a	Inherent Vice is a major stumble from a major filmmaker.
17400	3	a	The release of this documentary by James Marsh in the same week as Rise of the Planet of the Apes is wittily timed. It too speaks of caged primates, though its judgement on their captors is far more disturbing.
17401	4	a	All told, I was surprised at how much I liked the film, despite its flaws.
17402	5	a	Jodie Foster doesn't impress in this lackluster thriller that is far-fetched and uninvolving.
17403	5	a	A stinker, but almost worth seeing for the lovely Emmanuelle Beart.
17404	3	a	The often dazzling, special effects-driven slapstick tends to overshadow the fact that there are some slyer, more sophisticated laughs on offer in this blockbusting family comedy.
17405	1	a	Hardly a straight shoot-em-up, it instead serves as a commentary on the manner in which Western fact morphed into Western myth even as the ink was still drying on that particular time in American history.
17406	6	a	If you're looking for something to amuse the kids on a cold, windy afternoon then Road Chip is bearable enough -- just. But a fifth film would really be a stretch.
17407	1	a	The movie's irreverence and ability to surprise are precisely what helps it avoid being a big, pretentious mess.
17408	0	a	Heston's best work...and not surprisingly his favorite role.
17409	3	a	Is Air Force one formulaic? Yes. Is it gimmicky? Yes. Does it work? Yes.
17410	9	a	It is this vanity, this overweening self-regard, that makes Couples Retreat such a chore to sit through.
17411	6	a	Although the filmmakers ... stay true to [John Green]'s voice, they also soften it, downplaying the darkness and making one singular young woman more ordinary.
17412	4	a	You can't say Fast Five delivers the goods, but it delivers what it's supposed to.
17413	5	a	The Partridge Family sing-along almost killed me.
17414	9	a	Your appreciation for this shaggy dog project will probably depend on your enjoyment of Yi as a screen presence.
17415	3	a	Bell is extraordinary as Billy, the best child actor performance since Haley Joel Osment in The Sixth Sense.
17416	4	a	...a passably pleasant endeavor from Kasdan that is, admittedly, a far cry from his earlier work...
17417	3	a	... Law - while less riveting than Caine - does a fine job is this grown-up romp about modern sexuality
17418	1	a	Toni Collette gives a wonderful performance.
17419	6	a	Watching the film feels a lot like leafing through an album of someone else's vacation photos: Pleasant, but gets old fast.
17420	3	a	Suffers from a convoluted plot and an anticlimactic resolution, but hits enough high notes along the way to be enjoyable.
17421	2	a	What saves the movie from remaining an exercise in self-parody for all involved is director Roach's feel for the material.
17422	3	a	What Selma does particularly well is balance the ideological in-fighting within the Civil Rights movement.
17423	0	a	Only the deliciously demented imagination of Edward Scissorhands director Tim Burton could have come up with such a dark vision of the holiday season.
17424	1	a	A well-paced thriller that sheds light on a little-known piece of World War II history.
17425	0	a	How instinctively we react -- and connect -- when a film captures a feeling that is all too common, and all too real.
17426	1	a	"It used to be a hip putdown to call a film ""a religious experience."" Into the Wild just about is."
17427	5	a	Ends up as tiresome as the endless paperwork that keeps the title character from enjoying his life.
17428	4	a	Competent, watchable remake that improves on the special effects and running time but loses the moral complexity and the character work of the original.
17429	1	a	Embrace of the Serpent feels special because ... it recognizes that the two subjects are deeply intertwined, even as they sometimes appear at war. 
17430	9	a	A mindless, feature-length insult to the dignity and perfection of the Looney Tunes.
17431	9	a	When the most entertaining thing about a film is the printed press material that mimics the look of the test, you know you're in trouble.
17432	6	a	The Predator aims to revitalize the sci-fi action franchise with fresh ideas, but succeeds at delivering mindless action more than cohesive mythology.
17433	7	a	Lacking the wit to qualify as a sick joke, the ongoing saga of Hannibal Lecter has become the Grand Guignol equivalent of a shaggy-dog story.
17434	5	a	It's a childish kind of filmmaking that Alfred Hitchcock would call irresponsible.
17435	1	a	Hudson is so impressive than she could charm the paint off the walls.
17436	5	a	Performances are adequate, but mostly uninspired.
17437	1	a	Still Alice is a searing portrait of one of the least understood, most frightening plagues of this century.
17438	8	a	Sidney Hall, a film which offers a mystery that never feels mysterious, falls so flat one is bewildered as to why and how such a project could even be green lit.
17439	3	a	Comfort food for the family: a winning, frequently funny tale of love, camarederie and understanding set in a visual universe as arresting as it is idyllic.
17440	5	a	Takes Hughes' nativity story and shoves it into the far background of a sincere but tritely told modern drama about family, faith, and redemption.
17441	0	a	Tim Burton's best movie.
17442	5	a	drags harder than when Herzog tried to pull that boat over a mountain
17443	4	a	It's not dreadful, just dull.
17444	2	a	Crafted with the confidence and ambition of a master filmmaker, but that's not quite the same as the product of a filmmaker at his peak.
17445	4	a	It may not be a great film and its story's originality suffers... but it's shot with a very good rhythm and it hits the right notes when recalling the strengths of the [original] Predator starring Schwarzenegger. [Full review in Spanish]
17446	9	a	The movie revels in the kind of sadism it criticizes.
17447	2	a	It's an intriguing mix, if not always a smooth one. Yet, to its credit, I, Robot never gives up on [its] ideas, not even at the height of all the sound and fury.
17448	3	a	What gives the film its mesmerising atmosphere is cinematographer Jean Bourgoin's discrete contrasts between the vibrancy of the daylight revels and the looming malevolence of the nocturnal sequences.
17449	4	a	it is essentially a slightly more mature gross-out comedy
17450	4	a	It's rare to see a successful mainstream actress not only believe in this as a producer, but strip herself of beauty so fully that her hideousness becomes beguiling.
17451	9	a	But a screenplay that sounds like it was hewn from chunks of wood is a great leveller, so everyone comes out looking equally inept.
17452	4	a	A well-made remake that adds quite a bit to the original story. Alas, The Ring also feels dated and dull.
17453	9	a	A lot of whitewash is poured over a subject solely to wring emotion from the hapless viewer.
17454	4	a	Thankfully, there is light at the end of the tunnel. Just don't expect any grand revelations before the curtain falls.
17455	6	a	Maybe you'll work up more sympathy than I did for this great-looking kid who encounters no difficulty whatsoever seducing any female he desires.
17456	3	a	Even if you aren't one of the 'Firefly' faithful, Serenity will give you some insight into why other people are.
17457	4	a	An amiable little sex romp with a few real surprises when it comes to leaving everyone with a smile on their faces.
17458	3	a	Menashe wants to be a good single parent so badly, and his earnest intentions are sympathetic, but the film does a stupendously cruel job making you question if he ever could be. 
17459	5	a	Hancock is a giant mess of a movie. It's not just misguided, it's insulting.
17460	1	a	It's Trainspotting, and it's great.
17461	4	a	...good date film...
17462	6	a	If this movie had been directed by someone other than Curtis Hanson; I'm talking some nobody shmoe or some flashy music video director, critics would have dismissed this as just another singer-turned-actor star vehicle with no more depth than a shot glass
17463	0	a	The movie is a decisive breakthrough for Apatow, whose comic instincts go hand in hand with an unfashionable empathy.
17464	9	a	What happens when the worst tendencies of a poor screenplay are exaggerated by labored and unimaginative direction?
17465	1	a	The exhilarating car chase that closes the movie is alone worth the price of admission...
17466	4	a	A fetching romantic melodrama with a delicious performance by Vanessa Redgrave as an elderly woman on a quest for love. 
17467	3	a	"Carbon Nation"" is an inspiring look at the many recent advances in clean energy and green technologies."
17468	2	a	Wilson is the glue that holds the story together, and propels Shanghai Noon to the same stature held by Rush Hour.
17469	9	a	Isn't it amazing to see just how low some people will stoop if you pay them just enough money?
17470	2	a	The emotional complexities unearthed are distinctly adult.
17471	3	a	Even if you know how it was fated to end, it's a captivating journey, from the fun of their first days to the touching postscript.
17472	4	a	...as uneven and overlong as the first one.
17473	0	a	A gloriously entertaining ride, provided you have a taste for dark material and don't mind the occasional poke in the ribs.
17474	5	a	Without the first movie's element of surprise the joke goes stale fast, and laughs grow few.
17475	5	a	Becoming Jane attempts to please the purists and the dreamers, but only results in disappointing both.
17476	5	a	Visually stunning computer-animated sci-fi flick that unfortunately betrays its video-game origins with poor characterisation, an appalling script and a badly thought-out plot.
17477	0	a	Between a host of memorable performances by a cast of relative newcomers, and a haunting, grungy score, this coming-of-age comedy is a bona fide sleeper not to be missed.
17478	5	a	Gondry's contributions to the film amount to little more than rainbow sprinkles atop a very vanilla piece of cinema.
17479	4	a	[The filmmakers] can't unravel the central mystery of Margo or why, besides an ill-defined case of puppy love, Quentin would abandon good sense to pursue her. 
17480	9	a	[A] full-throttle assault on reason, taste and human dignity ...
17481	2	a	Scenes of such beauty they stun the senses
17482	0	a	A departure for Pixar: longer and a bit grittier ... and created by someone outside the Pixar family. ... But the movie's central elements are pure Pixar. 
17483	5	a	An inner-city drama promoting themes of friendship, loyalty and the value of a good education should be a welcome event, but writer-director Preston Whitmore's Crossover is so badly conceived and executed, its good intentions don't help.
17484	1	a	Why not go out on a limb and call it the next summer classic?
17485	3	a	Everyone in the cast is brilliant. Everyone.
17486	6	a	The Academy Awards are the biggest annual party that Hollywood throws for itself, and The Artist is a movie that worships Hollywood. Looks like a done deal.
17487	5	a	It is a creaky start, and matters fail to become smoother from there.
17488	3	a	Early Man isn't the flashiest animated feature that you'll see this year but it is certainly the most likeable.
17489	1	a	A solid crime thriller.
17490	0	a	Its script posses some of the sharpest dialogue ever written, and even if it's not exactly naturalistic, it's stylized in the best sense.
17491	2	a	Our Little Sister is an uneventful, if also overwhelmingly life-affirming, family portrait that once again establishes Koreeda as one of today's pre-eminent humanist filmmakers.
17492	4	a	The film's murkiness and muted colors suggest the malaise of the treacherous limbo into which the characters wander.
17493	0	a	It speaks to its entire audience, without ever seeming to joke over children's heads in a snide or overly knowing manner.
17494	2	a	A tragic chronicle of animal abuse.
17495	2	a	The strength of both families in the face of such frightening conditions provides the film with a moral center and tragic power that overcome its minor weaknesses.
17496	0	a	Welles almost creates a mise en abyme throughout Citizen Kane, inviting but ultimately refuting the tendency to want to reduce everything to one core sentimental genesis. 
17497	2	a	Payne shows a great deal of affection for these ornery, not always so soft-spoken Midwesterners, but he also demonstrates a fair amount of disaffection, too.
17498	3	a	Lane and Cusack create characters who are genuine, funny and romantic.
17499	3	a	As bold and smart a story about what it means to live online as any we've ever come up with...
17500	3	a	Crimson Peak is a vision that is del Toro's and del Toro's alone, and while it's not his most compelling work, it's very surely his most beautiful. That alone makes it worth the price of admission.
17501	10	a	Did Wahlberg read the script, or was it hidden under the pile of money that the producers dropped at his door step?
17502	5	a	Decidedly cheesy, and let down by disappointing action sequences, a script that's full of half-baked ideas, and an over-reliance on CGI-heavy effects.
17503	6	a	...a sporadically amusing yet disastrously overblown adaptation...
17504	7	a	Vantage Point is a patented representative of this year's early mediocrity. Vantage Point is trailer trash.
17505	3	a	Leave it to Pedro Almodovar to figure a uniquely twisted way to unsettle.
17506	3	a	This is a showcase for her [Parker's] sensitive intelligence, her watchfulness, and her way of thinking and reacting. The Family Stone did nothing for Parker, but Failure to Launch makes a strong case for life after Sex and the City.
17507	4	a	This plot provides plenty of material, but director Peyton Reed and first-time screenwriters Jeremy Garelick and Jay Lavender pack the film with characters and subplots that don't really go anywhere.
17508	4	a	Unusually perverse even by Almodovar standards. Fascinating dissection of the moral identity. 
17509	3	a	The story's constant and unexpected turns do provide rewards, but the real value of the film is in the richness with which it presents moral and emotional conflicts, laying them out with sensible realism and power.
17510	6	a	Devil's Due, the latest from the filmmaking team known as Radio Silence, is a perfectly serviceable horror movie with some rather neat mythology that unfortunately gets lost in the trappings of its own storytelling format.
17511	6	a	Dreadfully miscalculated
17512	3	a	As action-adventure, this space-based homage to Robert Louis Stevenson's Treasure Island fires on all plasma conduits.
17513	1	a	One of the best movies ever made about high school life in America.
17514	9	a	Tediously derivative
17515	4	a	McConaughey is an actor of limited range, but this time he has a film that fits firmly into his abilities.
17516	1	a	It's yo-ho-ho and a bundle of fun, along with an abundance of imagination and a bounty of spectacular imagery, a family film in the very best and most inclusive sense of that often misused term.
17517	1	a	It's an excellent film, although a tad flawed.
17518	6	a	Lyrically beautiful, with rich Oscar-winning sound - and a snoozer of a story.
17519	2	a	It's Garbo's next-to-last film and first American comedy.
17520	5	a	Taking Woodstock will leave the unstoned cold and won't have anyone aching for those legendary 'three days of peace and music' that wasn't there in the first place.
17521	3	a	Might be a stereotypical 'family movie,' but it's still a good one.
17522	6	a	Sayuri's geisha training plays out in formulaic montages, like The Karate Kid in kimonos. And the cast is allowed to lapse into theatrics that would shame Lillian Gish.
17523	3	a	Annette Bening gives one of her most enigmatic and painfully frank performances yet that cuts direct to the core.
17524	1	a	No dog person can sit through this homespun, relaxed picture without shedding a tear.
17525	6	a	Cianfrance has a proven track record of exploring how guilt can transform when burdened by the weight of time, but it's never felt more artificial in his hands.
17526	6	a	Man of the Year is merely a Robin Williams stand-up routine wrapped in a limp script.
17527	5	a	An ultra-gory video game-to-movie disappointment.
17528	1	a	It's a localized scenario, but what the movie skillfully does is increase its philosophical scale ever so slowly.
17529	6	a	Singer can only touch on the surface of each development. It would help if we could see the failure reflected in von Stauffenberg's one good eye, but Cruise, alas, can offer little help. He's just Tom Cruise in an eyepatch.
17530	5	a	Ideally, Billy Lynn's Long Halftime Walk shouldn't play like a demo reel for new technology Ang Lee wishes to unveil. Unfortunately, it does.
17531	3	a	"Paper Towns"" is a thoughtfully crafted drama with an ensemble of actors standing on the precipice of what deserve to be bright careers."
17532	9	a	The film combines ferocious self-importance with lashings of really nasty, unreflective violence.
17533	2	a	There's something disarmingly compelling about the story that keeps working despite the rickety framework Eastwood and Morgan have forced upon themselves.
17534	3	a	The gun show is in full effect in The Expendables, an old school action ensemble tailor made for our nostalgic times.
17535	3	a	Schwartzman and Law are pitch-perfect in their roles as dueling poster boys for a transcendent existence versus a materially rich life.
17536	5	a	Fanboys is an amiable but disjointed movie that identifies too closely with its heroes. Poking a little more fun at them would have been a great idea.
17537	6	a	Quaid ... caps his recent string of successes with one of the most irritating and useless movie heroes of all time.
17538	3	a	"It may be helpful - or vexing - to think of ""Black or White"" as the great grandchild of ""Guess Who's Coming to Dinner?"
17539	6	a	"The film gets much better in its second half when it becomes an ""Ocean's Eleven"" type adventure featuring many faces that will instantly be familiar to ""Fast/Furious"" fans. "
17540	2	a	An often amusing, harmless adventure with enough inoffensive humor and impressive CGI animation to make up for its lack of exhilarating moments and refreshing surprises.
17541	4	a	Slight, serene and sweet, it's a subtly calming interlude...
17542	5	a	A dud that tries to hide a simplistic plot and muddled message with frenzied flag-waving and overheated performances.
17543	3	a	Being a war hero isn't enough. The power of celebrity Trumps everything. Billy Lynn's Long Halftime Walk: Made in America. By an immigrant. 
17544	1	a	A genuinely moving and engrossing film brought to warm and authentic life by its gifted and intelligent stars.
17545	6	a	Like lazy summer days, it will be forgotten almost as soon as it's over. 
17546	6	a	The tone repeatedly flips from quirky to woeful. The costumes are gorgeous, though.
17547	3	a	Rather than serving as distractions, the self-referential shout-outs fit the overall mix of horror and humor.
17548	0	a	Linklater captures romance at the sunset of gadget-free existence ... holy moments when no gadget or lens comes between us and our immediate company and surroundings.
17549	4	a	The spectre of suburban domestic angst hangs heavy over Lawrence Gough's horror.
17550	6	a	It's amiable enough, but it's likely that even the easiest-to-please of viewers won't be overly impressed.
17551	2	a	The film may be violent and funny, but it's never simple.
17552	3	a	The real reason to see Paranoid Park is to check out how Van Sant's visual style is evolving, as he's one of the few big directors willing to try something unusual, often with tremendous results.
17553	3	a	The movie never steps wrong as long as it focuses on the developing love between the two big men and the tiny baby.
17554	5	a	Zhang gives his fondness for chaste melodrama and shimmering colours full rein: it's a style that suits his courtly martial arts films such as Hero, but this material would have benefited from a more Spielbergian, or perhaps David Lean-ian, approach.
17555	4	a	The film gets more tepid as it goes along and ultimately just drifts off.
17556	1	a	The final stretch relies on too many coincidences, and Sam Rockwell's character remains problematic throughout -- even so, the first two-thirds are pitch-perfect.
17557	0	a	Visually stunning, imaginative, and cleverly scored and choreographed, The Artist is quite simply and quietly, the year's finest film.
17558	4	a	A smart script peppered with genuinely witty dialogue and some nuanced acting by a young ensemble cast at least keep this coming-of-age story watchable throughout.
17559	4	a	It is not pleasing to watch, by any conceivable definition of that word.
17560	3	a	Colin Firth's humiliation is a thing of wonder. His entire career on screen and stage is beautifully sent up before our eyes.
17561	1	a	Tamara Jenkins' writing and direction are superb.
17562	3	a	As surprising and unlikely as it may seem, the third time is finally and most definitely the charm for this series.
17563	6	a	I'm not recommending it for those who know the original, but it might work nicely enough for those who have not.
17564	1	a	a film about the last hours of Christ that is both reverent, but also frighteningly realistic and frequently daring
17565	7	a	Billy Lynn's Long Halftime Walk is problematic beyond the fact that the visuals look both crisp and fake; the story itself is too telegraphed, on the nose and rushed.
17566	3	a	A powerful film with simple, heartfelt performances by all.
17567	10	a	Just when you think things can't possibly get worse, they do. And then some.
17568	4	a	A decade after Duets, a singing Gwyn proves she can still reach the high notes. Shame the melodrama plays strained and unoriginal.
17569	3	a	Other than an unconvincing Tom Cruise, this is interesting and well done, especially if you are among the apparent multitudes who don't know anything about this event.
17570	1	a	Christian Bale is at the top of his game here.
17571	5	a	Imagine watching half of Band of Brothers in one sitting, but with the story moving at a much slower pace.
17572	0	a	It has a furtive soulfulness that sneaks up on you. It's the real thing - a true romance - merged with a resonant riff on what might be called the metaphysics of tolerance.
17573	5	a	Movies about teenagers do better after kids have moved on to high school and even then it's a crapshoot.
17574	6	a	It's a tale told well, but from a definite perspective.
17575	3	a	Does Carey go too far? Duh. But why gripe when you can't stop laughing?
17576	4	a	Has its moments, but it's pretty far from a treasure.
17577	3	a	The director of Seven and The Game for the first time finds subject matter audacious enough to suit his lightning-fast visual sophistication, and puts that style to stunningly effective use.
17578	1	a	Great writing, brilliant direction, awesome music... What could go wrong? Easy: smack a ridiculous, insulting to the audience's intelligence ending.
17579	6	a	The Other Boleyn Girl turns British history into a chick flick soaper with high production values and A-list actors.
17580	5	a	"Mark Wahlberg shifts the dank micro-climate that is his charisma to Max Payne, a ""neo noir"" action thriller which means it snows a lot in murky New York."
17581	3	a	'Nebraska' is one of those funny movies that turn emotional, but it slips in moments of unexpected depth.
17582	4	a	Not bad for what it is, but what is--it never lets you forget -- is a self-aware, self-absorbed TV movie. 
17583	4	a	Not quite sure why this one tanked as badly as it did; I thought it was gorgeously realized, myself.
17584	6	a	Welcome Home Roscoe Jenkins leans too heavily on bruising slapstick for easy laughs, with Lawrence absorbing blows from most of his family members, when mosquitoes and skunks aren't getting in on the action.
17585	4	a	For me, watching Serenity was like watching the sequel to a movie I missed.
17586	3	a	Filmed in bleak green-gray hues, writer-director Peter Landesman's movie depicts D.C. as a nest of vipers, of conspiracies within conspiracies, of paranoia begetting paranoia.
17587	4	a	Failure To Launch, a funny but overly busy romantic comedy.
17588	3	a	This year's most unlikely-and most successful-exhilarating family-type entertainment.
17589	3	a	I liked Bee Movie because it was cute, funny, family-friendly, and mercifully brief.
17590	4	a	If you've got patience, you might enjoy it, but this is S-L-O-W.
17591	4	a	Who on earth seriously wants to watch an entire movie of Kate and Leo squabbling as their marriage implodes?
17592	2	a	Though it's sometimes abstract to a fault, Saint Laurent captures both the private frustration and the private sense of accomplishment that comes with making art.
17593	8	a	Is one aspect of this film really worse than the others? No. They're all equally bad.
17594	3	a	Eli Roth trades judgment and R-rated gore for empathy and kid-targeted chills in this delightful horror fantasy. 
17595	3	a	Carol is a visually rich period drama that boasts strong performances and refined direction, though some may find it easier to admire than love.
17596	3	a	Another hip-but- wholesome animated family comedy from Hollywood superhero Pixar.
17597	4	a	The film is not completely fair but it does convey a reasonably accurate sense of one aspect of the social consciousness following the War
17598	3	a	This is a well-made film with excellent performances by Robbins, Pena and Aiello.
17599	7	a	A long, obvious slog into marital melodrama.
17600	3	a	... a slight, forgettable movie. Sometimes that's enough.
17601	9	a	You could teach a college course on what not to do in a comedy by showing Meet the Spartans.
17602	2	a	As outrageous as the premise may seem, there's enough laughs to make up for the predictable road comedy formula we've seen so many times before.
17603	3	a	Schwarzenegger is never going to make the De Niros and Hoffmans of this world lose a night's sleep, but he has acquired a new confidence as an actor under Verhoeven's guidance.
17604	5	a	It's disaster-by- the-numbers.
17605	7	a	The kids in the film behave badly. The adults behave worse.
17606	6	a	Fantastic Four falters most in its cynical approach. Obviously gearing for a sequel, the movie goes heavy on development and light on action.
17607	0	a	The mise-en-scene is well composed, and the story is well told in this wonderful Australian work.
17608	6	a	Can't get away from the psycho-stalker formula, so predictability trumps creativity in the end.
17609	3	a	Spy sequel has serious kick thanks to Tony Gilroy's black-coffee script and Paul Greengrass's two-fisted direction.
17610	5	a	There's no real rhythm or ingenuity to the story.
17611	3	a	An effed-up funhouse. Rogen, a livewire satirist, dishes out an R-rated cartoon treat that tackles the crisis in the Middle East, the nonexistence of God and the sex lives of supermarket products.
17612	3	a	It's still a guilty pleasure - though the guilt quotient is a bit higher - and that's down to the still-extraordinary presence of the massively gym-built Arnold...
17613	5	a	It should have remained a skit on SNL
17614	1	a	Clearly embraces the spirit of the beloved novelist.
17615	3	a	A thoughtful, analytical yet still emotional film, meticulously investigated and absolutely compelling.
17616	0	a	Films as special as this one are not often seen. [Full review in Spanish]
17617	4	a	Convoluted as some of the developments may be, the movie never loses its interest or atmosphere within the swampy, backwater Georgia town, and as summer popcorn-fare, it is unusually intelligent.
17618	4	a	"Depp can't sell the ""tourist"" look. At the very worst, he looks like he could be working as a coffee kiosk barista at the Alitalia terminal in Rome's Leonardo Da Vinci Fiumicino Airport."
17619	4	a	"Perhaps not quite as sweet as ""hunny"" but still entirely palatable."
17620	1	a	Certainly a best-case scenario as far as sequels to iconic classics go. McGregor, Miller, Bremmer, Carlyle and Boyle haven't missed a beat in the twenty plus years since the first. 
17621	5	a	According to anyone you care to ask, Factory Girl has been cut and recut a couple of times and may not even be the movie that filmmaker George Hickenlooper intended to make. This sounds reasonable, as nobody sets out to make a movie this banal.
17622	9	a	A stacked deck of one-dimensional demonstrations of female oppression, explored - and overcome - with Perry's typically well-intentioned but misguided notions of empowerment, 'The Single Moms Club' ranks among the filmmaker's worst work yet.
17623	3	a	At the moment, the only person eating more delectably in Italy is Tilda Swinton in I Am Love.
17624	6	a	You want the movie to stomp and rejoice and cry like a fool; instead it meanders and lollygags, occasionally flaring up, then sputtering again.
17625	3	a	An entertaining, economical and thoroughly enjoyable glimpse into a familiar artist's creative process.
17626	4	a	Plenty of eye candy, A healthy dose of laughs.
17627	2	a	In places the film sails a little too close to the cannibalistic pseudo-science of Event Horizon or Pandorum, but it has an underlying intelligence that keeps dragging it back on track.
17628	4	a	Man of the Year isn't Movie of the Year. It might have been an ironic condemnation of electoral fraud and the malignant sway of corporate profits. But for a while, anyway, it had my vote.
17629	0	a	"Astonishing...Monster has a lot of humanity in it, and it refuses to categorize people as strictly ""good"" or ""bad."
17630	4	a	The movie is silly and cute, but spoiled by its own failure to be special.
17631	4	a	...the director spends so much time recounting in minute and realistic detail the agony of Christ that he neglects the stronger, spiritual message, of love and kindness.
17632	10	a	If an original thought found its way into this horror-comedy it would die of loneliness.
17633	3	a	Soderbergh has made an indie movie the way he wanted to, on his terms, and the result shows the success of this method.
17634	4	a	That's the glory and the difficulty of The Predator. It's a perfect distillation of our moment--and it's an unfortunately perfect distillation of our moment... It's a sh---y Predator movie is what I'm trying to say; but it's a great film about predators. 
17635	2	a	Fast and twisty, A Perfect Getaway is an economical little thriller that pretty much accomplishes everything it sets out to do.
17636	5	a	A worthwhile tale might lurk somewhere in Taylor Hackford's latest, but this flaccid look at the early days of Reno's legalized bordello business takes a fictionalized approach to history...
17637	5	a	Though Silent Hill's shoddy dialogue and incoherent story constantly irritate, several sights and scenes possess a certain surreal grandeur.
17638	5	a	There is a core of substance in Marvin's Room, and persuasive acting to back it up. Which makes it a special pity that the filmmakers didn't trust viewers to have the necessary intelligence to figure that out for themselves.
17639	8	a	Kitsch looks marvelous, but that's the problem: He looks a little too marvelous. He's all sexed up with little to do.
17640	9	a	We suspect right at the beginning that so-and-so is going to turn out to be the villain... and then, an hour later, after the plot thickens, there is the less-than-astonishing revelation that so-and-so is indeed the villain -- just as we suspected.
17641	9	a	Also known as, 'How to Make an American Critic Doze Off.
17642	0	a	A virtuosic cinematic achievement of epic proportions, Paolo Sorrentino's formalized comment on modern-day Rome is a visual and satirical feast. 
17643	5	a	One of those frustrating almost-good films which never really catches fire.
17644	2	a	Love, Simon proves to be a new exception to the rom com genre, bringing Simon's coming out story to life with heart, nuance and the ever-integral message of acceptance.
17645	9	a	Man of the Year is often so wildly off the mark in its depiction of how elections are run, it's hard to believe that it was directed by the same guy who helmed Wag the Dog.
17646	10	a	Misses the mark by an entire continent.
17647	3	a	Dark, resonant, inventively detailed and packed with fleet turns of plot and a feast of visual amazement.
17648	5	a	...a thoroughly pointless little flick.
17649	9	a	rubbish
17650	2	a	John Moore's remake doesn't come close to upstaging its predecessor...and yet it doesn't exactly humiliate itself either.
17651	5	a	Much amazing dance talent is again given dazzling showcase, but the sporadic bursts of cathartic joyfulness herein are fewer and further between than in any movie in the series.
17652	3	a	It's a glorious experience, one that blends both compassionate dismay and wry delight over Italy's own, eternal excess.
17653	1	a	Mr. Nelson's observant, detailed script flawlessly captures the mood of what American ennui has done to both old and young men on their way to becoming losers, lending a look and feel that seems like the Great Depression.
17654	5	a	Lighthearted and lightweight. Is Moretti beginning to lose his bite?
17655	5	a	I love Philip Seymour Hoffman, but his directing debut, like so many American Indies, features strong characters cursed by a lack of story, purpose and pacing.
17656	4	a	Here's a movie filled with bright ideas, crammed uncomfortably into a story burdened by confusing and often contradictory exposition.
17657	6	a	Hitch suffers from a good-joke deficit that even Smith's charm has trouble balancing.
17658	0	a	Hazanavicius is a true visionary artist himself, rejeuvinating a fond and near-forgotten skill and masterfully making it obtainable and oddly contemporary.
17659	4	a	It's an interesting mix of American Idol and suicide bombers that almost works... They could have dreamed a bit bigger.
17660	3	a	If you're looking for a movie you can take your parents or young children to without fear of embarrassment or the need for endless explanations, this is the one.
17661	4	a	Another elusive non-story about oh-so-existential beautiful misfits
17662	7	a	Muddled and largely unentertaining.
17663	4	a	It's a vibrant, dangerous tale of revenge dominated by a stunning, multi-layered performance from Kate Winslet.
17664	7	a	This is dull, dull stuff.
17665	4	a	It has the spirit of a classic, John Hughes film from the eighties, but imprinted with the new millennium. [Full Review in Spanish] 
17666	1	a	"While it's no surprise that Moore is so good, ""Still Alice"" has an unexpected trick up its sleeve: the sweetly gentle performance of Kristen Stewart, as Alice's actress daughter Lydia."
17667	10	a	The fourth sequel to a film designed to stand alone... In the end, there should have been only one.
17668	0	a	With Romero's newest film... a celebration is in order.
17669	4	a	While the result is that Reign of Fire has its share of tense moments, the film is really nothing more than a passable little B-movie.
17670	4	a	It is an oddity, one full of stiff acting, jarring camera shots, and a story that remains unsold.
17671	3	a	The story, while no Dr. Strangelove, is very poignant as a satire on politics and modern culture.
17672	6	a	plays like a teen sex comedy filtered through the relative sophistication of urban twentysomething hi-tech workers
17673	5	a	"Here's what's truly infuriating-the fact that the beloved young-adult novel of which the film is based fell into the hands of the ""Hostel"" series horror-famed director Eli Roth."
17674	1	a	Pixar's movies may be completely digital, but each one beats with a human heart.
17675	4	a	the final act is worth the price of admission for fans of the game. All things considered, though, I'd much rather just be playing the game.
17676	0	a	Black Snake Moan is a gorgeous, life-affirming movie. On paper, it sounds lurid bordering on ridiculous.
17677	6	a	It is not a very good film, but at least there is something going on here, most of the time.
17678	9	a	"Another of the three or four obnoxious, race-baiting flops Hollywood routinely seems to tolerate from Martin Lawrence between can't-miss blockbusters such as ""Big Momma's House"" and ""Bad Boys."
17679	2	a	With a good helping of humor and engaging performances, The Kings of Summer makes for a delightfully entertaining coming of age tale.
17680	2	a	This epic-style movie is packed with emotion and adventure, although it also feels a little overlong and meandering, mainly due to the narrative itself.
17681	4	a	Agora is entertaining, and even at times illuminating.
17682	4	a	Bullock and Grant, like the viewing audience, appear to be waiting for some memorable payoff that Lawrence fails to come close to delivering.
17683	6	a	At best, this film is strictly cable fare.
17684	4	a	In what is a very uneven film, the director Trish Sie delivers exhilarating musical set-pieces alongside often crass and clumsy characterisation.
17685	4	a	... serves only to dilute the delicious, mysterious evil that Sir Anthony Hopkins brought to the role... furthers only in adding to the studio's coffers.
17686	9	a	Contrived, mawkish and mirthless, this feels like it was made by people who haven't had any meaningful human contact for years.
17687	3	a	Simon Pegg is on fire here, giving a truly balls-to-the-wall performance as Gary. It's his best ever, especially as he partakes in an all out bar brawl without spilling a drop of his pint
17688	3	a	While Cruz acquits herself capably, this is, necessarily, an exercise in virtuosic superficiality.
17689	10	a	In the very least, Hal Needham's Smokey and the Bandit films displayed a fair amount of affection amid the hamming for their shit-kicking rubes.
17690	4	a	"It's based on a children's book by Berkeley Breathed, creator of the classic comic ""Bloom County,"" so there's a shaggy, countercultural vibe; if you get in the groove, it's a hoot."
17691	3	a	'The Skin I Live In' is rooted in pain and loss, which pulls the film's more melodramatic side into a more thoughtful, provocative place than its surface suggests.
17692	7	a	About as realistic--and as enjoyable--as dinner at a Medieval Times restaurant...its expiration date seems to have passed even before the lights go down.
17693	1	a	a thriller that really does thrill and at the same time draws viewers into a mathematical problem. 
17694	0	a	"Cosmopolis"" is a deeply subversive, deeply intelligent movie for grown-ups. Brilliant."
17695	5	a	An overlong, meandering mess, and a stain on Spielberg's CV; it's certainly the least satisfying film of his I can remember seeing.
17696	4	a	MacFarlane ensures that any sops to touchy-feeliness come with an arm-punching pay-off.
17697	4	a	A touch slight by Disney standards, but even if it's not high art, it's still warm-and-fuzzy fun.
17698	7	a	[D]oesn't necessarily make for a good way to spend almost three hours of your day. Inherent Vice is ultimately akin to listening to a stoner tell a long, complicated story while you're staying clean.
17699	6	a	The movie ditches clever for crass: Mo'nique and Mike Epps, as opportunistic cousin Reggie, provide most of the downhome and dirty entendres. Less 'nique would have fixed much of what ails this movie.
17700	5	a	Just because you give an old car a new paint job doesn't mean it runs better.
17701	4	a	A fun little flick that Chan or western buffs should go check out at a matinee.
17702	0	a	Pure Hitchcock.
17703	0	a	Charles Burnett bridges theatrical dialogue, portentous omens, and presentational acting with masterful grace.
17704	6	a	A sudden lurch into trippy abstraction at the end simply doesn't work, but for the vast majority of the time this is a strong and original film.
17705	4	a	This is such a ripping true story that it can't help but grab hold of the audience, even if the film never quite breaks through the surface.
17706	4	a	... a stark, realistic portrait of a working-class mother in New York's depressed Ulster County as she tries to battle a drug habit.
17707	6	a	The overall framework of the film leaves little to get excited about.
17708	3	a	Like the first film, it cleaves too faithfully to the source material, but it always fills the screen with spectacle.
17709	2	a	While the story may not be very plausible, the film is compelling largely because of excellent performances by Jodie Foster and Peter Sarsgaard.
17710	3	a	Bruce Greenwood is exceptional as JFK -- quite a surprise after his smarmy villainous turns in Double Jeopardy and Rules of Engagement.
17711	4	a	It could have been shot down a country lane in Rutland, but Allen naturally preferred the charms, history and passions of Paris for a story that's both timeless and topical.
17712	3	a	Trivia alert: Tim Matheson is Debbie's teenage son
17713	3	a	The cinematography gives a stark feel to the film and the editing too is taut and crisp, making sure the drama doesn't drag anytime. Leaving everything aside, watch the film for the acting alone and you won't come away disappointed.
17714	4	a	One can't help but admire a know-how that permits a generation of walking nuts-and-bolts to move effortlessly amongst men.
17715	3	a	Not quite The Great American Tragedy, by a moving work exploring the underbelly of family lives.
17716	0	a	This formalist approach to the narrative takes a hard right into more stylized imagery in the third act which is as breathtaking as it is surprising.
17717	3	a	Director Ridley Scott, whose recent history has brought us wonderful action films like Black Hawk Down and Gladiator, translates Eric Garcia's book about a neurotic con man into a compelling film.
17718	5	a	Doesn't go far enough, isn't scary enough and has mad scientists who just aren't mad enough.
17719	5	a	Highly, uh, informative. But so was your eighth-grade history class.
17720	1	a	Look at what else is playing in multiplexes across North America at the moment and, if you can find a film that entertains and touches as effectively, give us a call.
17721	5	a	The only type of lives this glossy comedy-drama resembles are ones in formulaic mainstream movies.
17722	4	a	Has Erin Brockovich written all over it, mostly due to Meg Ryan's blowsy performance.... Alas, the comparison doesn't work in this film's favour.
17723	3	a	A rare breed of action flick -- one that doesn't take human life for granted.
17724	0	a	Brilliant performances by Burt Lancaster and Tony Curtis, and James Wong Howe's glowing black and white photography, are the perfect compliments to the rapid-fire screenplay.
17725	9	a	Stallone's dozens of remaining fans know exactly what to expect, and he gives it to them good and hard. 
17726	6	a	It's possible there's not a single moment in the movie - in terms of dialogue, plot or design - that can't be directly attributed to another flick.
17727	3	a	Gets off to a slow start, but once it gets going, it's one of the more fascinating thrillers in recent memory, even though everyone who paid attention in history class will know exactly how it turns out.
17728	4	a	Pooh's sense of wonder and innocent jubilance isn't lost in Disney's live-action/animation hybrid, but it's in service of a predictable story with so little to say.
17729	5	a	Funny, I always thought of the National Lampoon crowd and Star Wars nation as separate demographics.
17730	3	a	The film and its actors are at their best when acknowledging the tragedy of inarticulate men banging their heads against fate.
17731	7	a	A really big yawn...No one whose age is into double digits will find much to enjoy in this gentle, innocuous and very dull feature.
17732	3	a	An effective mood piece about cultural dislocation and personal alienation...
17733	4	a	It's not When Harry Met Sally, but then again, what is?
17734	4	a	...lurking underneath the sleek and fashionable veneer is a not half-bad little morality play.
17735	9	a	It takes someone who has actually played the game to explain what a colossally bad idea the Doom movie -- and most films that use video games as source material -- was from the start.
17736	1	a	At nearly three hours, it's too long by a third...and that's where the quibbles end. The film is rich and intelligent, beautifully shot and just as well acted. Not the year's best movie, but among them.
17737	2	a	An intriguing, sensual whodunit that would have been even better had it not succumb to political correctness and changed the identity of the killer from Crichton's novel.
17738	4	a	It thoughtfully reflects on how deep sorrow and melancholy can change existence, with both Damon and de France really making their performances count.
17739	2	a	An ambitious, stylish and intriguing first effort by Aronofsky and director of photography Matthew Libatique. If you're of a mind for an offbeat but fascinating film, give it a shot.
17740	4	a	What makes any of these kinds of movies run involves the appeal of the main actors, and all three, stalwart in their screen likabilities, smooth the proceedings.
17741	9	a	Too often, National Security tries to be a gritty thriller and wacky comedy at once.
17742	6	a	Rocky II has a waxy feeling, and it never comes to life the way its predecessor did.
17743	3	a	The subtle on-screen chemistry between father and son gives this sweet and poignant drama a solid emotional base.
17744	7	a	Two movies in one, and there's not enough breathing room for both of them.
17745	9	a	[A] dull and messy ride through supernatural Clint Eastwood territory.
17746	3	a	Top acting honors go to Ray Liotta as Gary Figgis, a cokehead cop who just might be Freddy's only friend.
17747	4	a	A spirited, speculative, engaging escapade...
17748	3	a	Witty, featherlight and openly sentimental, this is Woody's love letter to Paris and the most relaxed, likeable movie he's made in years.
17749	6	a	With McDormand as the Greek Chorus for the left side of hatred and Rockwell the bumbling bumper sticker for the right side of hatred, it's unfortunate that Harrelson's Sheriff is eventually reduced to a deus ex machina character.
17750	2	a	Right down to the delicate touches, like the ways two different people's hands linger on Therese's shoulder, everything is constructed with minute attention to human detail.
17751	4	a	There are many incidental pleasures to be had.
17752	3	a	It's a little disappointing that the first major film about Nelson Mandela isn't about Nelson Mandela. But Invictus is a different sort of movie and a good one.
17753	3	a	A daunting challenge for any actor, Oyelowo rises to the task, in a film that eschews the traditional biopic approach.
17754	1	a	It has been a while since mainstream Hollywood has come up with a big-budget, big-star vehicle as unique, audacious and rewarding as The Curious Case of Benjamin Button.
17755	6	a	There is much to like in the individual performances... and much to regret in a heavy-handed, message-laden screenplay and curious visual choices by Lee.
17756	4	a	A thought-provoking movie that is still relevant with the many environmental concerns that are out there now.
17757	4	a	Wholly unbelievable.
17758	6	a	"The tawdry atmospheric ""insurance fraud film"" crashes along with its plane crash vics."
17759	6	a	With its thin premise and stereotypical characters, a better title would have been A Big Fat Waste of Time.
17760	4	a	An engaging, empathetic - if confusing - character study.
17761	4	a	Harrison Ford is one of the most likable and convincing of movie stars, and he almost pulls off the impossible in Air Force One.' I don't mean he saves the day; I mean he almost saves the movie.
17762	6	a	[Provides] dumbfounding sci-fi vistas in admirable quantity if not quite in creativity.
17763	6	a	Cassavetes starts to lose the plot at the precise moment he starts keeping exact track of it.
17764	3	a	A worthy remake.
17765	0	a	Beautifully directed, visually stunning Western with terrific performances from Casey Affleck and Brad Pitt - this is one of the best films of the year.
17766	2	a	"Sometimes the social satire is a bit too obvious, but thanks to a smart screenplay and excellent performances, ""The Joneses"" is largely successful in delivering on its intriguing premise."
17767	0	a	A deeply personal exploration of the extremes of human behaviour, with a lean, real-world sensibility that makes it easy to empathise with the notion of survival at any cost.
17768	5	a	All of the voice support is pleasing, but just like the animated journey itself, it's all a little too bland and unmemorable for one to go nuts over.
17769	1	a	This film is a necessary reminder of what can happen when people preserve tradition for its own sake.
17770	4	a	Jackson's growling performance... and the sheer 'What the hell?' audacity of the story almost make Black Snake Moan a guilty pleasure.
17771	9	a	What's worse than a listless sequel to a terrible movie? How about a listless sequel with a far less interesting cast than the first film.
17772	2	a	The numerous cast members, especially those on team Bravo, are not all given the chance to become three-dimensional characters.
17773	0	a	Spielberg marshals all his formidable storytelling talents and puts them at the service of an epic human drama.
17774	0	a	Atmospheric love story with Eastwood and Streep in great form.
17775	1	a	Wittily juvenile with clever, catchy songs to match.
17776	10	a	The Titanic is now the second-biggest disaster Kate Winslet has ever been associated with.
17777	1	a	Despite over-ripe narration and an understandable urge to cram too much in, Ghosts of the Abyss is a thrilling documentary.
17778	5	a	Too much message and too little psychological validity.
17779	3	a	It may be dry and sullen, but it's also smart and classy.
17780	6	a	Though it aims to be a sharply humorous look at the mommy wars, I Don't Know How She Does It has nothing remotely new or comical in its arsenal.
17781	4	a	Chess electrified the blues, Chuck Berry electrified white audiences and after seeing this film you're going to want to find a compilation of Chess hits, settle in with a longneck and groove to some of the best American music ever made.
17782	5	a	Akin to an extremely well-made Saturday morning cartoon -- great for hyperactive four-year-olds or hungover students, not worth a trip to the pictures.
17783	0	a	The movie is made up of odd parts that somehow go together perfectly. One of the most important films about teenagers ever.
17784	5	a	Crimson Peak is a triumph of production design that attempts to cover for a generic story with little in the way of complexity or incident. 
17785	10	a	"There isn't single reason I can think of to see ""The Predator"" other than to be reminded of how low Hollywood and American sensibilities have sunk. "
17786	4	a	Valkyrie's technique is admirable but it misses the mark emotionally.
17787	2	a	Ms. McTeer's sly, exuberant performance is a pure delight, and the counterpoint between her physical expressiveness and Ms. Close's tightly coiled reserve is a marvel to behold.
17788	3	a	A pleasure for anyone looking back or forward to the experience of leaving home for the first time.
17789	4	a	Maybe the filmmakers just got a little lazy, but it was disappointing to watch it wrap itself by becoming just another killer-in-human-form thriller.
17790	4	a	Too cute for its own good, Larry Crowne is nonetheless hard to dislike.
17791	3	a	While the film is unflinching in its depiction of the brutality of both the English and the Irish, Jordan pointedly dissociates his hero from any actual ugliness.
17792	1	a	Most costume epics come complete with a deadly seriousness, a dreary self-importance that demands respect but doesn't earn any love. Amadeus turns that notion on its side and introduces fresh air back into the stuffiness.
17793	2	a	Mr. Moretti finds broad comedy in the antics of some clerics, who can seem as sweet as children, but in Melville there is pathos and there is tragedy, and not his alone.
17794	6	a	Jude Law's considerable charm as the philandering limo driver whose heart is the last to be broken goes a long way toward making this needless film palatable.
17795	4	a	I have no idea what writer/director David O. Russell was trying to accomplish with this messy but not-quite-a-disaster of a movie.
17796	6	a	A perfectly serviceable mindless action film.
17797	4	a	Only Almodovar could get away with this potentially grizzly melodrama and make you laugh as well as shudder.
17798	6	a	Mother and Child has the pretence of being something more meaningful, but it's really just a notch above soap opera.
17799	3	a	Both a salty comedy of uncompromising eccentricity and a requiem for a generation still sending sparks from fading embers.
17800	6	a	The power of spectacle overrides spiritual insight.
17801	3	a	[Loach] allows us to look into lives we would otherwise ignore.
17802	3	a	There's more than enough here to recommend it, especially when you factor in Boseman's skillful portrayal and a phenomenal soundtrack that reminds you just how much of a musical genius Brown truly was.
17803	3	a	A wonderfully touching and hilarious final chapter to Wright's Cornetto Trilogy, The World's End is a truly satisfying exploration of nostalgia and friendship
17804	3	a	Charming, little comedy that amuses from start to finish.
17805	7	a	The film satirizes the blandness of such seeming perfection.
17806	1	a	The performances here are stellar.
17807	6	a	It is difficult to watch Nosferatu simply because it is so hard to find a decent copy of the film.
17808	5	a	There are a couple of tingly reveals and creepy fake-outs, but it's just too familiar. John Shooter tells Morty that his story needs a better ending. So does this movie. 
17809	1	a	Even though Chamber of Secrets is a vast improvement, Columbus' directorial touch remains more caring than inspired.
17810	1	a	Coppola, an assured and confident young filmmaker, has crafted a small poem, about being lost and being found.
17811	3	a	A solid war film that builds to a riveting climax.
17812	5	a	Identity Thief exhausts you with slapstick. 
17813	1	a	After it has ended, you may want to view it all over again, just to see if you can beat the odds and pick up on what you missed the first time around.
17814	3	a	Ambitious, beautifully animated, and clever to a fault, Ralph Breaks the Internet breaks free of the pitfalls of most sequels by never forgoing heart for the sake of bigger franchise pyrotechnics.
17815	5	a	[A] sloppily made exercise of rip-offs and redemption.
17816	0	a	This film is playing a delicate game, offering observations about human nature while it undercuts our expectations about how we watch movies.
17817	4	a	The acting is good, and the story is well-told, but THE INFILTRATOR is more serviceable than extraordinary. 
17818	9	a	a snore of a film whose sole positive accomplishment is teaching us a new word, trebuchet
17819	6	a	It's a shame that within such beauty lies a pretty gloomy story, one that foolishly trusts the audience will get behind the whole stealing-a-baby concept. I didn't, and I got very bored.
17820	6	a	With its flat look and sometimes slow pacing, it curiously feels like a movie made in the Seventies.
17821	4	a	Lane possesses a wry, self-deprecating grace that can invigorate the lamest cliche. But she's really up against it this time.
17822	0	a	Hitchcock's twisty, suspenseful tale is far more involving and memorable than most recent Hollywood thrillers.
17823	2	a	This film is 'exploitation' in more than one sense of the word.
17824	3	a	Harris, who adapted the screenplay, and director Peter Webber are faithful to his book. Strong production values, a lush score and scenic locations work seal the deal.
17825	3	a	"A solid film that keeps you guessing on the facts, ""Chappaquiddick"" is an unbiased attempt to tell the story everyone thinks they know."
17826	4	a	[McConaughey] and Hudson make the premise, even in its shakier moments, vibrate with a sense of fun.
17827	5	a	The first collaboration between the veteran Oscar-winning filmmaker Barry Levinson and legendary comedian Bill Murray yields a leaden political satire that doesn't measure up to one's great expectations.
17828	4	a	The film reminds us that character, not plot, is what binds us to a story. Cutting between scenes of each in her unique environment, the movie tantalizes us.
17829	1	a	Not only one of the best romantic comedies of the year, but one of the best films in ages.
17830	2	a	This edgy story may seem heavy and dark, but it's infused with a great deal of humor.
17831	6	a	It's all presented with a lack of real emotion and in a hail of noise and explosions.
17832	6	a	It's easy to be fascinated with how John Carter looks, but it's difficult to get emotionally involved.
17833	5	a	Despite his free and easy camerawork, which generates some lovely moments between Ian and Sofi, Cahill's narrative jolts along in fits and starts.
17834	6	a	This somber cousin of My Week With Marilyn could really do with more ruminations on acting, on and off stage, and fewer on the ravages of terminal illness.
17835	3	a	Despite all the cursing and envelope-pushing and bat-bleep crazy sexual stuff, Sausage Party isn't mean-spirited. It's just... stupid. But also pretty smart. And funny as hell.
17836	4	a	Beyond implausible, but it works as a live-action cartoon.
17837	6	a	In The Break-Up, men are slobs, women are passive-aggressive, and viewers opposed to broad brush strokes for either gender are sorely out of luck.
17838	4	a	MacFarlane mines this lode for just enough gold to keep us interested one more time, and his holdings have now played out.
17839	4	a	It's lightweight and pleasant entertainment for very small children, short and careful not to wear out its welcome.
17840	4	a	Every taboo about the relationship between women and men is used to make an effective punchline. [Full review in Spanish]
17841	4	a	Simple-minded situation comedy, but undeniably appealing.
17842	3	a	Unlike Tarantino movies, this film wasn't peppered with pop references all over the place, but it did lace itself with a fine overtone of comedy and irony.
17843	4	a	Sitcom-amusing, in that middle-of-the-road way.
17844	6	a	It's not just the lack of dialogue but a thin story that keeps this nihilistic tale from conveying a convincing sense of suspense. Too many details are withheld to keep the audience captivated.
17845	8	a	Given that Brazil, as a Latin American moviemaking powerhouse, steadily produces vibrant, vital films of real impact and humanity, it's a crime itself that Elite Squad may be the only Brazilian film that American audiences see this year.
17846	5	a	Yes, there are laughs, but they're sporadic, with a lot of the jokes being regurgitated from the original.
17847	3	a	The documentary gives us a tantalising taste of what appear to have been some incredible performances. Such is the quality of the footage and sound recording that you rather wish the film was longer.
17848	9	a	"The Angry Birds Movie"" is just fowl."
17849	8	a	plunges almost immediately into the suspense and maintains it throughout, highlighted by terrific performances by Foster, Sarsgaard, and Bean.
17850	3	a	Writer/director Rodrigo Garcia has fashioned a clear-eyed look at motherhood at all stages.
17851	2	a	Dated, to put it mildly. But still colorful, with charming lead performances and that wonderful score.
17852	5	a	If the filmmakers had spent less time on the visual, and more time on appropriate characterizations and a believable script, we might have been as much in love with the film as it seems to be with itself.
17853	4	a	It packs some dramatic fireworks but, in the end, not enough emotional punch.
17854	3	a	Kid-friendly film serves up inconvenient truth.
17855	4	a	Interesting - Not Great
17856	5	a	"Turgidly paced and overly reliant on less-than-thrilling underwater sequences, it's the ""Moonraker"" of Sean Connery's run -a misstep defined by heyday technology that the producers thought would look cool in the era but feels hopelessly stale today."
17857	1	a	A rich, tangled and layered work whose lurid, sensual style -- and seething and ebbing score by Alberto Iglesias -- is like lava cooling upon the volcano below.
17858	4	a	Enjoyable teen sex comedy that gains points for its female perspective and features both strong comic performances and a decent script, despite some of the gags being a bit hit-and-miss.
17859	1	a	First Reformed is not for the faint hearted, but this raw, blistering, bleak and uncompromising drama raises important questions about faith and morality.
17860	1	a	Not just a re-creation of an archaic technique -- the characters are real, vivid, and affecting. The movie transcends its story to be more than a tribute to a simpler time.
17861	3	a	...the film is ultimately difficult to resist, though it's clear that those who generally dislike this sort of thing will really hate this.
17862	3	a	Striking throughout are the seemingly caught-on-the-wing moments that subtly enrichen the film's characterizations.
17863	4	a	There is still plenty of whimsy, colour and slapstick comedy present in The Angry Birds Movie to keep the adults relatively entertained and the kiddies -- who are more than likely to be the most entertained -- giddy with joy.
17864	1	a	It's probably best to take the movie for what it is: a look at a young, brilliant man who's trying to figure out his future -- and his sexuality.
17865	5	a	The Break-Up mostly just lies there -- alternately adoring and condemning its characters for their puppyish refusal to grow up.
17866	1	a	It's Schrader's on-point filmmaking--a nouveau spin on the spiritual films, character studies, and transcendental style of cinematic Old Masters like Bergman and Bresson--that functions as what Toller calls 'another form of prayer.'
17867	5	a	Whether you guess the ending early or have it smack you upside the head, the result is the same: You'll be out the price of a ticket.
17868	1	a	The definitive sci-noir.
17869	1	a	Is The Imitation Game middlebrow stuff as some have claimed? In a sense, yes, it probably is, but that doesn't prevent it being compelling entertainment. 
17870	7	a	Gary Larson did more with this idea in a single Far Side panel than Steve Oedekerk and his army of animators can muster over eighty minutes in this tepid computer-generated kidflick.
17871	4	a	For all its humor, Early Man can't overcome the limitations of its premise-one of Park's less fruitful genre mashups.
17872	5	a	It almost put me to sleep, and considering just how many explosions, near-escapes, fireballs, rockets and cracked heads it packs into its almost two-hour running time leading this viewer to the edge of narcolepsy is a pretty nifty trick.
17873	4	a	It's never dull, occasionally surprising and unafraid to delve into Bond's life more than any film since On Her Majesty's Secret Service. Unfortunately, all of that comes at the price of gaping plot holes and staggering lapses in logic.
17874	3	a	A low-energy/moments of heat romance that rewards the patient filmgoer and bores the impatient one. 
17875	2	a	The topic--international adoption--is certainly compelling and the performances convincing, but as a drama, Casa de Los Babys never quite comes to life.
17876	9	a	Richard Donner brings us the latest Crighton film, sending Paul Walker and Gerard Butler back to Medieval times. The book was medoicre at best... this adaptation is insipid.
17877	6	a	You can almost see the filmmakers flailing their arms, desperately manufacturing contrivance upon contrivance to separate and reunite the movie's unlikely pair.
17878	9	a	Doom is like some kid came over and is using your computer and won't let you play.
17879	6	a	If you're one of the many who just don't think [Tim and Eric are] very funny, there's little here that will change that opinion.
17880	3	a	Sometimes excessiveness and implausibility are virtues in disguise. Movies this enjoyable don't come about by accident.
17881	3	a	Whedon's clout has given the artist some cache to turn his failed boob tube opus into a wondrous and wild sci-fi adventure on the big screen...an exuberant space opera.
17882	3	a	When Ralph Breaks the Internet ignores the glittering marvels of the internet and focuses on the rapport between its two leads, it's deeply moving.
17883	6	a	I'm starting to suspect that Lee's insight into American thought is only a little deeper than a Western filmmaker who thinks he's brave for still bringing up bound feet.
17884	3	a	Its visual and musical delights are constant and plentiful.
17885	3	a	Ridley Scott proves that he can't suppress his frosted side forever, thanks to this spirited and undeniably sweet look at the con game spliced with a family drama -- his best work in years
17886	3	a	"You could argue that the film would be stronger if it explained more fully and asked more questions, yet ""Unmistaken Child'' stands as a window on a beautiful and mysterious world. The questions it leaves hanging are for us to untangle."
17887	3	a	Kids will enjoy this strangely touching tale about the bond between mothers and their children.
17888	9	a	Terminally unfunny
17889	3	a	It should go without saying, everybody with a heart and soul deserves to be treated equally. Sometimes it takes a cursing, flatulent, pot-smoking, joke-cracking teddy bear to teach us common sense.
17890	4	a	Most of the new ideas grow naturally enough out of the original material. But they almost invariably amplify Carver's bleak worldview, and in a film that runs for more than two hours, that adds up to an oppressive sit.
17891	4	a	Though families will enjoy the classic story with a cosmic twist, the most valuable gem is the beautiful mix of hand-drawn and computer animation.
17892	6	a	Stay has all the signs of a look-what-I-learned-in-film-school movie.
17893	6	a	"Builds with conviction well on its way to an ""A"" rating before dropping the marbles."
17894	5	a	Like an over-the-hill fogey sorely mistaken about still being hip, this treacly comedic drama is startlingly out of touch.
17895	0	a	All minor reservations aside, the movie must be counted as a great success. 
17896	0	a	Selma is an important movie, yes, but it is also a great one.
17897	3	a	Smith's knockout comic performance, with its perfect pitches and pauses, ultimately saves the day.
17898	3	a	Air Force One is a wonderful way to spend an afternoon, as long as you don't mind nitpicking afterwards.
17899	6	a	... we've come a long way, baby. And when it comes to contemporary sex in the city, movies like Alfie always opt for pretty over gritty.
17900	3	a	Old-fashioned charmer for the family.
17901	3	a	Love and obsession make beautiful music together in this romantic drama
17902	7	a	An uneven, dull and painfully asinine action comedy that's neither thrilling, funny nor visually stylish enough to deliver pure entertainment. Go rent Kick-Ass instead.
17903	10	a	This just in, Video Game movies still suck.
17904	9	a	On paper, this could have been excellent; as it stands, it's painful and futile for all involved.
17905	2	a	Subdued when it should be overblown and worthwhile when it should be a trifle.
17906	3	a	a real treat
17907	5	a	It's no fun. Everyone takes this way too seriously.
17908	1	a	An almost perfect blend -- sometimes alarmingly bitter, sometimes sadly -- and amusingly -- sweet.
17909	1	a	A slowly flowering miracle: an epic of normal life.
17910	4	a	J.K. Rowling has spoiled us for any other story involving magic - stories like The House With a Clock in Its Walls, haunted-house tale for kids that gets by on silliness and the odd screen pairing of Jack Black and Cate Blanchett.
17911	5	a	A series that gloried in wit, irony and sex has been reduced to a generic spy thriller.
17912	3	a	Ultimately, Film Stars Don't Die in Liverpool is an extremely rewarding romantic drama and should appeal even to those unfamiliar with Gloria Grahame
17913	6	a	You would think the producers would have hired a director who could put together an exciting action sequence and not the guy who made a hash of Shaft.
17914	1	a	A feat of accentuated sound design and arresting cinematography, luxuriating in the beauty of Italy.
17915	4	a	The high marks are present and littered frequently throughout. It begins with the heartbreaking turn from Academy Award winner Rachel Weisz as the devastating Hannah, a grief-stricken mother whose arc goes into interesting territories. 
17916	3	a	It doesn't do a lot of deep thinking, but unlike many futuristic combos of sf and f/x, it does make a statement: Freedom of opinion is a threat to totalitarian systems.
17917	6	a	Amusing ... but not distinctive.
17918	5	a	It was only a matter of time before [Larry] got his own critic-proof movie.
17919	9	a	Parts of Cadillac Records surface as warm reminders of a timeless musical era. Most of Cadillac Records comes across as a miserable Saturday Night Live skit without the benefit of a sleep-deprived audience to feign approval.
17920	4	a	If you are looking for mindless action, it's not bad. But since this is trying to be something more than that, I can't quite recommend it.
17921	4	a	It's aggressively pacey, overloaded with smug one-liners, gore-laden and unlikely to have much of a future.
17922	6	a	...never rises above interesting and many will find it dull. Humor could have helped, as the narrative ends up being a pedantic procedural.
17923	2	a	If Betty Blue feasts on the bodies of its leads, it's this director's cut that fully establishes the movie's artistic bona fides.
17924	6	a	Though boasting the innovative technology of Cinerama, this anthology of the Old West is too long, often tedius, and only occasionally pleasurable.
17925	0	a	Silver Linings Playbook tells us that happily-ever-after may depend on finding people who coexist with our lunacy, not ones who can lead us out of it. In any case, it's crazy good.
17926	1	a	Here's another example of Pixar's mastery of popular animation.
17927	2	a	It's refreshing to watch a movie aimed at young people that's actually grounded in reality.
17928	3	a	It's a very cool piece of filmmaking -- as it has to be, given the intellectual sleight-of-hand that lies at its heart. Yet it succeeds as both great entertainment and an absorbing rumination on the dangers of playing God.
17929	5	a	Corny and silly...with a brisk pace and lively soundtrack.
17930	1	a	Even despite a big let-down, which fortunately comes near the end, it stands sixteen hands above the level of routine horse opera these days. So strap on your trusty six-shooters and race to the wind-swept Capitol, you lovers of good old Western fiction.
17931	0	a	Through [Karamakate's] eyes we experience the world in a spiritual way in which man and nature are harmonious and time is fluid.
17932	4	a	The South Park team's sendup of Hollywood action epics and the war on terror is at once admirably furious and sophomorically infuriating.
17933	3	a	There will be movies with bigger casts, louder explosions and more zombies -- but few will boast the sheer spirit of The Kings of Summer.
17934	2	a	It's a very heady movie. There isn't much to speak of in terms of action. It's Taxi Driver without the taxi: A long ride inside the mind of a man beginning to see the world around him in a whole new and increasingly hostile way.
17935	6	a	It simply wallows too deeply in its grief to be uplifting.
17936	6	a	Lucas' presence looms in the flick's uneasy balance between rapt devotion and sly foreshadowing of the franchise fans' bitter days to come.
17937	5	a	i just hated every single character soooo much
17938	4	a	It is absurd yet enjoyable, and playing fast and loose with English history is a refreshing alternative to slow and tight solemnity; the effect is genial, even mildly subversive.
17939	3	a	Congratulations, loyalists. Veronica's return is everything you've hoped it would be. It's so much fun you may want to put a few bucks aside for a sequel.
17940	4	a	Todd Haynes has crafted a visually stunning picture with Carol, a lesbian love story brought to life with remarkable performances by Cate Blanchett and Rooney Mara.
17941	4	a	A bizarre, but engrossing film.
17942	0	a	Just when you think you've seen all the World War II films you can handle, one comes along that leaves you in awe.
17943	2	a	It's what makes Apatow's comedies so interesting: old-fashioned notions of love and commitment, delivered with honesty and without too much sentiment, decorated with a contemporary taste for the vulgar.
17944	3	a	Mr. Walken is unusually convincing in a difficult, hermetic kind of role.
17945	0	a	The best heist film in years. 
17946	4	a	We now know the size of the bite Tina Fey can take out of a meaty role. Feed her.
17947	8	a	"Look up the definition of ""paper towns."" Reading the definition in a dictionary will be more entertaining than seeing this movie."
17948	6	a	"It's a little bit ""Boogie Nights,"" a little bit ""Argo,"" a little bit ""GoodFellas."" It's a breath mint, it's a chewing gum, it's a laxative, it's a hockey puck."
17949	3	a	Jordan Vogt-Roberts' The Kings of Summer features an economic script, likable characters, a fun style and plenty of sharp humor -- although its plot is a bit on the slim side.
17950	8	a	It'd be tempting to call Larry the Ernest of his generation, but that'd be a grave insult to Jim Varney's enduring legacy.
17951	3	a	Accessible and inclusive, this is a major pop-culture breakthrough, offering authentic validation for LGBT teens, worthwhile insights for hetero viewers, and crowd-pleasing entertainment for everyone.
17952	3	a	A movie that makes you think.
17953	5	a	[The film] roughly sticks to the plot points of the novel but sheds its nuance.
17954	3	a	A nice respite from some of Allen's more daunting think pieces
17955	3	a	The film is powerhouse genre, touching in its strange, graceful arc towards total resignation, and tinged, as the best and purest of all American genre films are...
17956	9	a	Underneath the sugary sweet external coating of Radio is a cynical and pandering piece of hypocrisy.
17957	4	a	Under Tom Dey's direction, a perverse form of symmetry is at work here, and the stereotypes seem like old acquaintances you can enjoy for a couple of hours.
17958	7	a	You want eye-rolling moments? This movie will detach your corneas.
17959	4	a	A winsome blend of Home Alone and The Breakfast Club, it's unabashedly silly kids' movie.
17960	3	a	It's the whooshing terror that fries your nerves to a frazzle.
17961	0	a	Jaws is a sensationally effective action picture, a scary thriller that works all the better because it's populated with characters that have been developed into human beings we get to know and care about. 
17962	4	a	The movie is eminently watchable: The production values are blue-chip, the script is often funny and cute, Hathaway is reasonably charming.
17963	6	a	Clearly, nobody will mistake Kasdan as a modern-day Aesop as his floundering yet free-wheeling fable Orange has the unwelcoming taste of a dour lemon.
17964	0	a	A slow movie classic which explores a rainbow mix of religious and spiritual themes.
17965	3	a	A tremendously sensitive and complex portrayal of a forgotten star which forgoes caricature in favour of a deeply personal story.
17966	5	a	The film plays it safe, portraying only the mildest or most fanciful forms of teen rebellion.
17967	2	a	Foster is a master at portraying a woman in terror who's trying to balance her fears with a survival instinct that drives her to somehow prevail.
17968	6	a	This pulpy, procedural, even methodical melodrama is infuriating, revealing how 'justice' is very different for the rich and powerful.
17969	4	a	While many questions and motivations are left unanswered, overall the film wins out with its stark truths and slightly twisted pay off's along the way.
17970	6	a	Haynes' chronicle of the glam era is visually rich but too dramatically fragmented and overwhelmed by music to permit involvement in the tale's characters or the director's POV. 
17971	2	a	Adopting a convincing American accent, Pattinson aces the role despite his panic attacks before the film starting shooting in Toronto.
17972	3	a	The payoff is big, and the journey is never less than absorbing, and this, along with GET OUT, proves that horror as a genre for legit A-level work is back in full-fo
17973	6	a	I am overwhelmed by the intensity of theme, and underwhelmed by the sophomoric content thereof, and so I end up in the middle, sort of whelm-neutral.
17974	3	a	This powerful tale of galling entitlement and ruthless insensitivity is filtered through an impressive performance by Clarke, who finds in Kennedy the pathological combination of a man stunned by what he has done, yet stirred by what he must do.
17975	0	a	"I was a little worried when I went to see ""No Country for Old Men"" because many people have been labeling it a masterpiece, but for once all the hype is warranted."
17976	4	a	While Bolt isn't as funny, memorable or inspired as the animation classic from which it pilfers, it's still beautifully animated, cleanly told, professionally voiced and makes you smile without insulting your intelligence.
17977	4	a	Wedding feels a bit anachronistic. Still, not every low-budget movie must be quirky or bleak, and a happy ending is no cinematic sin.
17978	5	a	The Danish director has made an incredibly dour, music-tinged drama that might break some hearts, but just made me want to break things.
17979	6	a	Where Animal Kingdom kept dragging us towards its dark, dead centre - often against our will - The Rover just warns us to keep our distance and leaves it at that.
17980	4	a	OK light comedy, directed by and starring Alan Alda, about filming of movie in small town.
17981	6	a	Innocuous. But at this stage of cultural progress on the gay acceptance front, that's not enough. 
17982	6	a	A routine remake of a superior film from an earlier era always prompts the question: Why bother?
17983	3	a	Succeeds both as a sci-fi adventure and as a familial love story.
17984	5	a	As much as we'd like to see an American president made accountable, we don't have to see it over and over and over again.
17985	3	a	This is a vast and commodious work, and even allowing for the unsuccessful passages there is a lot here to treasure.
17986	5	a	Can take its place among animated films unexceptional in their depiction of humans and among a long line of B-movies about small bands of mercenary heroes who save a world or city or town as filmgoers know it.
17987	3	a	Seems born not of contrivance but genuine, hurtful truth
17988	1	a	Others, if they choose, may praise Trainspotting for its squalor; I prefer to praise it for the invigorating perspectives of a writer and a director with ideas and the ability to convey them.
17989	0	a	Rockwell is fearless in exploring this hissable Id-with-a-badge, down to showing us what makes him tick like a time bomb. His performance should be sufficient reason to see Three Billboards.
17990	3	a	All national and industry politics aside, Logan Lucky is a high-octane gas, a shaggy-dog story that's hard to outguess.
17991	3	a	Bloody adorable. 
17992	3	a	Rango turns out to be a master of adaptability and good will in the end, in fact, an educating and entertaining little ambassador for all with an addictive personality.
17993	9	a	It's a slapdash, heavily marked-down affair.
17994	2	a	Slavin ... overdoes the portent, but in this time of Muslims being wounded by the same arrows aimed at Taliban terrorists, there is no denying the relevance of the tale.
17995	3	a	This will not be for everyone -- but if you loved the foul-mouthed bear first time round, he just got even filthier.
17996	3	a	Fey's resourceful, wry and witty performance-pulls us through time and again.
17997	3	a	My Big Fat Greek Wedding uses stereotypes in a delightful blend of sweet romance and lovingly dished out humor.
17998	1	a	Sprinkling in bad jokes and Rat Pack references, Dean Martin's comic timing and delivery is impeccable -- as he parodies and deconstructs his image as a notorious lover and drunk.
17999	5	a	Ryan's performance is all on the outside. She pitches her voice low and tahks about bahkzing. She wears teensy tight outfits. And she has done something unwise to her lips.
18000	3	a	Adams carries Enchanted's fairy-tale conceit on her tiny shoulders - and on her, it floats as if sprinkled with pixie dust.
18001	5	a	Someone seems to have told Hollywood that our favorite sport is boxing, and that Hollywood should make more movies about boxing, and that we will never get tired of boxing movies, especially formulaic ones about real people.
18002	4	a	I Am David is a fine family film about a twelve-year old boy's escape from a Bulgarian prison camp and his quest to find out his true identity.
18003	1	a	Considerably less satisfying than the original Rocky, but head and shoulders above the later installments.
18004	6	a	To watch Jodie Foster storm through a phony airplane for an entire movie has its very minor pleasures, but there is nothing here to feed the head or fray the nerves.
18005	5	a	Here's the plan the writers came up with to handle the obstacles between their story and plausibility: Ignore them.
18006	3	a	Nicely paced and fits the bill for those in search of two hours of spy-based action and martial arts.
18007	3	a	Complex and thought-provoking.
18008	4	a	The big-screen Green Hornet, while hardly classic comic-book filmmaking, ain't half bad. 
18009	6	a	The filmmakers draw on interesting material here; too bad they don't go anywhere interesting with it.
18010	3	a	[Spielberg is] in absolute visual, physical command of this material, presenting the complete chaos and destruction with frightening clarity.
18011	0	a	Truly one of the greatest films ever.
18012	4	a	Revenge, mother-daughter bonds and the transformative power of clothes are the threads stitched deftly throughout Jocelyn Moorhouse's quirky Australian comedy drama, which induces tears as much as giggles.
18013	3	a	It's not just escapism. 'Are you for real?' Mei asks Jin; later, he asks her, 'Who are you, really?' These are questions with cultural as well as personal associations.
18014	1	a	One of the year's pleasures for the eyes, mind and heart -- a bright star indeed.
18015	6	a	It's all just a game, and even with my own fairy tale fantasies of being Princess Guinevere and meeting my very own dashing Lancelot reverberating in my memory, that isn't enough to keep me interested in this muddled mess of a movie.
18016	3	a	The movie delivers what it should -- cheap thrills -- and serves them up with skill and economy.
18017	6	a	Pleasant but entirely forgettable.
18018	4	a	A solid first sequel and the truly chilling jump scare at the end gives the original's a run for its money.
18019	6	a	The twists are thoroughly predictable, but even if any tension and suspense were generated, it would all be squandered by the film's contrived fizzle of an anticlimax, which is not only disappointing but makes little sense.
18020	3	a	A real go-for-the-throat satire tracking the rising tide of rage in America.
18021	6	a	The filmmakers take the story so seriously Reign of Fire becomes the dullest movie imaginable about fire-breathing lizards. It's Godzilla written by Strindberg.
18022	4	a	The movie's occasional narrative shortcomings are offset by the performances, which are uniformly fine.
18023	6	a	"Levinson lines up a flabby and humorless series of mini-homilies on current political evils, from corporate donations to TV ads, like a Nader-ish ""plague on both your houses"" scold."
18024	5	a	Another lame, predictable comedy created by and starring a former Saturday Night Live star.
18025	3	a	All I can tell you for certain is that Nebraska got to me.
18026	5	a	Welcome to Mooseport has no bite, no edge, and no discernable drive when it comes to making with the yuks.
18027	5	a	This cheerless, tiresome sequel is so tastless and flimsy that it proves big families aren't much fun after all.
18028	5	a	All over the place. A good premise bogged down by messy execution. A missed opportunity. [Full review in Spanish]
18029	8	a	Feels like a commodity, and an undistinguished one at that.
18030	0	a	As fascinatingly complex and brazenly original as any movie released this year...a breakthrough masterpiece.
18031	9	a	The movie is so elementary, so simplistic, offering stock situations and cardboard characters who ... remain unchanged that it plays like an extended version of a sitcom ...
18032	7	a	full review at Movies for the Masses
18033	4	a	The lovely performances, especially by Gadon and Powley, make the film a passably pleasing tale of teens gone slightly wild, with a royal twist.
18034	0	a	Fischner's ability to subvert expectation by delivering such an ultimately positive message is the film's greatest achievement.
18035	0	a	A moving look at a life well lived.
18036	3	a	A lighthearted romp that delivers laughs, and a thought or two, along the way.
18037	6	a	The Darkest Minds has its moments, but for the most part, it's like watching a dubbed VHS copy of a dubbed VHS copy. 
18038	1	a	This genre picture is still a thrillingly original science fiction creation.
18039	2	a	Every one of the actresses seems to have been directed to chew scenery and aim for over-the-top, and the end result is very, very funny.
18040	3	a	On surface level, Nebraska is a road movie about discovery. But through brilliant performances, stunning cinematography and most of all, a wonderfully well-told story, it becomes a bittersweet portrait of family.
18041	6	a	There's not a single jump-in-your-seat moment and believe it or not, Jason actually takes a backseat in his own film to special effects.
18042	4	a	The glittering decadence of this culture on the verge of collapse is in fact the film's most fascinating aspect, and Mr. Pollack has re-created it extravagantly.
18043	5	a	[Wilson's] phenomenal performance as a family man undone by sexual and financial temptation is more than this movie deserves.
18044	10	a	One of the very worst movies I've ever seen.
18045	6	a	in its pleasantly low-key way, this is as inconsequential and instantly forgettable a movie as a bombastic blockbuster like Transformers: Dark of the Moon.
18046	5	a	Loving a stranger is not fully convincing... but it is better than most high school movies. [Full Review in Spanish] 
18047	3	a	A bright and sharp-witted -- if predictable -- romantic comedy.
18048	0	a	This is no heavy-handed tale of Western decadence versus pure indigenous wisdom, with Guerra constantly emphasising the ambiguous relationship between the two.
18049	5	a	an impressive display of sound and fury that falls apart the minute any scrutiny is applied to the machinations of its plot.
18050	3	a	A low-brow comedy chock full of cheap laughs.
18051	2	a	Hell or High Water is interested in so much more than whether or not the last man standing is the righteous one.
18052	4	a	The program, however, is by no means the worst effort Norris has ever participated in and the ending, in which he single-handedly wipes out an entire brigade of bad guys, has a certain heroic charm to it.
18053	9	a	What really hurts is Quaid's ridiculous idiot persona as the prez. It is simply too off center--even with a Texas twang.
18054	1	a	The movie begins with a whirlpool of comedy and manic energy, and then grows, as it must, more serious and introspective.
18055	6	a	Chadwick Boseman has done right by James Brown in Get On Up; it's a shame the movie isn't worthy of either of them.
18056	3	a	This one-joke movie manages so many imaginative wrinkles that it successfully extends the joke into a feature length film.
18057	4	a	The jokes are strong and delivered by a very talented cast, but the heart isn't there. It's easy to laugh, but hard to care.
18058	1	a	"[VIDEO ESSAY]...the success of ""The Imitation Game"" comes down to Benedict Cumberbatch's sensitive portrayal of a complex personality."
18059	5	a	A sparkier and more soul-searching script would have made this a much more satisfying journey.
18060	6	a	There are a few surprises and some clever misdirection, but it does take a long time to get there.
18061	3	a	"Having gone from unknown actress to Oscar nominee to ""The Hunger Games"" in what seemed like a blink of an eye, Lawrence shows herself a master of timing and plays off Cooper brilliantly."
18062	3	a	Fast, light and funny, Galaxy Quest has a wide, generation - spanning appeal -- and you don't have to be a die-hard Trekkie to enjoy it.
18063	4	a	You want it to be a gripping drama, but it turns out to be, more or less, an especially attractive shop window. Look, drool even, but don't think.
18064	5	a	And as it progresses, the characters become so stupid that we lose interest in them.
18065	9	a	The cinematic equivalent of Madonna's cover of 'American Pie'.
18066	3	a	I think this just might be [the Coens'] best film so far, with some qualifications.
18067	1	a	Todd Haynes has directed Carol, from a screenplay by Phyllis Nagy, with superb precision. 
18068	1	a	Judd Apatow's raunchy and realistic look at sex, marriage and responsible parenting is one of the most consistently funny movies of the year.
18069	8	a	A super-dud.
18070	9	a	The cinematographer- turned-director likes his MTV-style editing so much that in his drive for hyperkinetic overkill he sacrifices coherence to wallow in barely contained chaos.
18071	3	a	Imagine a Sergio Leone remake of Chocolat and you will get some idea of the tone set by this sumptuous, lavishly embroidered tale of Outback revenge.
18072	4	a	Everyone becomes a pawn in a much larger game as this muted, low-key thriller weaves its tangled web.
18073	8	a	The constant movie references didn't make me laugh, they made me want to see other movies. Better movies.
18074	6	a	Seagal gives us a fairly good Bruce Lee impression in a film that is more moronic than it should be.
18075	5	a	Hysterically bad sci-fi with an even worse theme song.
18076	6	a	On the heels of the recent release of Wes Craven's crafty and creepy airline thriller Red Eye, Flightplan seems to hit a lot of unnecessary air pockets in comparison
18077	5	a	What's truly perplexing about the failures of How Do You Know is that the film was written and directed by James L. Brooks, a master of the rom-com genre.
18078	5	a	A major disappointment that is about as difficult to swallow as the Denny's meals that are among the avalanche of commercial tie-ins that have accompanied its release. 
18079	4	a	Much of Valkyrie works, but not quite enough.
18080	6	a	For a movie that's about compassion and understanding, it makes for a shockingly indifferent experience.
18081	2	a	uncompromising with its philosophy and its vulgarity
18082	7	a	Marked by jarring jumps in tone from broad comedy to drama, action-suspense and, most ridiculously, earnest 'message' material about the unfairness of standardized testing.
18083	5	a	I see London, I see France, I see Chevy do a dumb dance. [Blu-ray]
18084	3	a	The cartoon line drawings of Jeff Kinney's popular book series are fleshed out with lively results...
18085	3	a	...among the best representations of a gay love story depicted on screen.
18086	1	a	"Part road movie, part romance, part coming-of-age comedy and part something entirely its own, ""Safety Not Guaranteed"" is an unexpected pleasure."
18087	7	a	"The Kings of Summer"" is a poor man's ""Moonrise Kingdom"" - with none of that film's editorial sense of kitsch, dry wit, or style."
18088	2	a	"When you remember something,"" one of the group members says at one point, ""it's because your spirit is in it."" And there's plenty of spirit kicking around inside ""Buena Vista Social Club: Adios."
18089	4	a	"The cast is first-rate, notably Neeson in the title role. ""Mark Felt"" benefits mightily from his very particular set of acting skills."
18090	1	a	Eloquently makes the case that Philip Seymour Hoffman and Laura Linney are the most dextrous actors of their generation.
18091	3	a	entertaining and worth seeing for Garbo, one of the first magnetic screen presences
18092	4	a	A likeable and light-hearted comedy that doesn't attempt to be anything more.
18093	8	a	Born of a desire to make money off of children who don't know any better and their indulgent parents who should.
18094	5	a	The film was a typical seventies sci-fi effort, scientifically illiterate and unimaginatively composed.
18095	4	a	Its cast is remarkably strong for such simple fare. Cynics will mock it, but it's an undeniable crowd pleaser even if its resolution drags on too long.
18096	3	a	When you boil it down, there are few movies that demonstrate as well how people's lives seem to randomly intersect, or how much of an impact we have on each other, whether we know it or not.
18097	0	a	Never rushed, never pushed, Coppola's steady hand is felt in almost every frame, gently coaxing her subjects and story to a deeper, invigorating resolution.
18098	3	a	Really excellent but really violent Oscar winner.
18099	0	a	"Miles Teller gives the performance of his career as the indefatigable Vinny ""The Pazmanian Devil"" Pazienza, and writer-director Ben Younger delivers one of the best boxing movies of the decade in Bleed for This."
18100	1	a	A volatile mix of familial drama and madcap comedy, infectious optimism and razor-wire wit, it's one of the most purely enjoyable films released in the past twelve months.
18101	3	a	...an above-average slasher...
18102	6	a	It does nothing to challenge the self-centredness of the smug little world it depicts, and everything to endorse it.
18103	3	a	The Imitation Game is a fantastic piece of historical theater that never fully embraces its cinematic identity.
18104	0	a	The Fight Club is a memorable and superior motion picture - a rare movie that does not abandon insight in its quest to jolt the viewer.
18105	6	a	The actors are forced to labor through such laughable lines as: 'Love is not a race,' 'You don't dance, you float' and other whoppers no sensible girl would buy for a second.
18106	3	a	The intrigue is in the details that initially passed you by. The men, for instance, are all army veterans. They address each other by rank and their booze-fuelled camaraderie seems to be an expression of their status.
18107	2	a	The result is a film that seems simultaneously grand and skimpy. For all its faults, it's an honorable effort, though. I hope Weir doesn't wait seven more years for his next film.
18108	5	a	It's ultimately difficult to envision all but the most ardent of fashion fans finding much to embrace in Valentino: The Last Emperor...
18109	0	a	... director Sam Mendes manages to pay sophisticated, sincere homage to the conventions that define the Bond series while remembering that one of the things that makes the series such an enduring presence is fun.
18110	9	a	You don't want to see Rock the Kasbah. If you do, you're reading the wrong newspaper.
18111	1	a	Martin McDonagh's best movie to date...
18112	2	a	...great kinetic, silly fun.
18113	3	a	The next time any movie tells you the Martians are coming, choose the better part of valor: Just duck.
18114	6	a	What could have been a complex portrait of a flawed man dealing with the perils of success ends up far less interesting. 
18115	3	a	It's a bit dated now, but still has much to offer, notably George Cukor's intelligent direction.
18116	8	a	Prima facie evidence of Hollywood's virtual January-February non-compete clause... and proof that sustained effort does not a desirable final product make.
18117	5	a	...includes all the expected elements of the heroic biopic and never foregoes an opportunity for moral and emotional uplift. 
18118	3	a	The grace, craft and real wit in this country house party make it his most seductive film in a very long while.
18119	10	a	"To sit through this is to suffer the grossest sweaty-palms-on-the-glass sex scene. Funny that the film closes with an overbearing end-credits song by Jennifer Paige - a one-hit wonder who, like ""Autumn,"" is a pop-culture footnote best left forgotten."
18120	4	a	Much of it is far too shallow, of course, and Carter films it like a music video unfortunately diluting some of the power inherent in both the performances and the message.
18121	3	a	a ripping good yarn
18122	6	a	This is an impressive production and technical feat, but through most of it, I kept thinking about how difficult the filming conditions must have been, and not about the lives of the men in front of me.
18123	6	a	A critique on consumerism comes off like a vehicle for product placement
18124	4	a	Superman's sequel is probably as good as the original.
18125	4	a	Whenever it stays with Piccoli ... it's mysterious and moving, struck by the humility of a man who's not up to playing God.
18126	0	a	By the end of the film, it's as if I know these people, and I want to sit with them again for a few hours. Or six.
18127	7	a	Hollywood fantasy and teen-girl wish-fulfillment, with very little personality.
18128	3	a	Sets a high standard for the event movies to follow.
18129	2	a	Antal's debut is a sharp, blackly comic hugely entertaining thriller that manages not to get entangled in half-baked symbolism until its very last shot.
18130	6	a	The characters are so generic and the plot so bland that even as rogue CIA assassins working for Chris Cooper's agency boss close in on the resourceful amnesiac, we don't feel much for Damon/Bourne or his predicament.
18131	5	a	Doesn't quite live up to the original.
18132	3	a	A punishing viewing experience, but a uniquely vile sit that rewards the brave with exemplary technical credits, a sure pace in the early going, and the sight of McConaughey reacquainting himself with excellence. 
18133	5	a	In short, We Bought a Zoo is all bore and no roar, and while it's certainly not the worst of Crowe's career, it's far from earning its stripes as a worthy successor to his earlier films.
18134	4	a	Barry Levinson deviates considerably from the wry, ironic tone of Malamud's novel, and if the film is mildly enjoyable it's due to the acting of the supporting cast and polished production values.
18135	5	a	Missing at least two of its promised four dimensions.
18136	4	a	The giddy fun of the Disney Princesses scene stands out, because nothing else does. 
18137	1	a	As gripping as any fictional thriller.
18138	7	a	When it stops making no sense, it's really quite boring.
18139	6	a	A winsome if utterly conventional ugly-duckling story about a sympathetic character's much deserved progress toward a richer self.

18141	6	a	Must decency be dull?
18142	3	a	A poetic and pleasant film that works as a tender and sensible entry in Koreeda's universe. [Full Review in Spanish]
18143	3	a	The Joneses often taps the same shopping fetish for luxury geeks as Sex and the City does for women; this movie may have been financed through high-end product placement alone.
18144	2	a	Leaves me craving for the entree.
18145	3	a	The film is a minor Christmas miracle: It succeeds on its own terms, despite the gossip hounds' best blood-sniffing efforts, and dares to be an entertainment rather than a statement.
18146	4	a	The scenery's great and the performances adequate, but wake me when it's over.
18147	3	a	A very intelligent and sophisticated lvoe story reminiscent of The End of the Affair or Brief Encounter.
18148	1	a	Gorgeous actresses and visuals abound, as do witty and biting dialogue and ever more outrageous twists and revelations.
18149	0	a	In retrospect it is clear that the rapturous Miami Vice is the work Mann has been building to.
18150	4	a	Taking Woodstock has its pleasures; it's really a sweet-natured coming-of-age tale, with a famously groundbreaking rock concert lurking in the background.
18151	6	a	Real-life fanboys know that the release of this mildly cute, mildly drooly, majorly too late spoof/homage has been delayed for more than two years.
18152	5	a	Grisly, tongue-in-cheek sequel isn't for kids.
18153	6	a	What's inevitably lost is any real attempt to track Liz's internal shifts, the way her travels jostle her preconceived notions of selfhood and spirituality.
18154	3	a	Built out of strongly acted moments of unflinching honesty, Josh Mond's UWS-set feature debut redeems the indie grief movie -- take that as an endorsement and a warning.
18155	5	a	A tedious romp through familiar Hope territory.
18156	8	a	Part scathing, part ruminative, part tragic but profoundly affecting, First Reformed is an astonishing piece of cinema.
18157	4	a	A watchable and competently acted drama ... It's all very much out of the American Beauty rulebook.
18158	5	a	truly a last-gasp effort
18159	2	a	"The comic relief never wears out the dramatic relief, and vice versa. It is low. Come for the sheep whizzing in MacFarlane's face-we're even now for ""We Saw Your Boobs."" Stay to see Theron handling a battering husband rather aesthetically. "
18160	6	a	What emerges from the bilious murk of first-time director Laurence Dunmore's film is a sad picture of an intelligent and talented writer who opted for self-indulgence and gratuitous insult over anything more meaningful.
18161	3	a	The magic of cinema defined, The Curious Case of Benjamin Button displays filmmaker David Fincher's visionary excellence to maximum effect.
18162	1	a	Skyfall doesn't forget it has to be an exciting spy film above all, but from its first scene, it ratchets up the drama in ways that have little to do with action.
18163	1	a	Even if it didn't have a spellbinding central performance from Cate Blanchett, Carol would be worth seeing just for its sumptuous re-creation of an era...Todd Haynes' film is luminescent - like a perfectly preserved Kodachrome image.
18164	3	a	Terrific early Hitchcock, though it has dated rather badly.
18165	6	a	It is February, and this one is at least watchable. So go ahead and pick it up. Just don't expect it to be there when you get home.
18166	4	a	This is silliness that's good for a video replay on a rainy day.
18167	1	a	Linney and Hoffman deliver two more creatively textured performances in this story about the strain and comfort of family relationships.
18168	2	a	Aside from a top performance from Helen Mirren as Hitchcock's wife, the film is particularly intriguing for the way it shows the impact of a director's private life on his work.
18169	2	a	It's all very corny and much of it's almost alarmingly overbaked... Yet it works.
18170	10	a	What - what - have they created here? Really folks, I'm at a loss...
18171	8	a	Cheaper by the gross.
18172	4	a	The [movie's] two halves are larded with European coming-of-age cliches... and never meld into a satisfying whole.
18173	3	a	An eerie tale that is all the more effective for its restraint.
18174	3	a	Smith's homegrown pastiche is compact, sometimes rambling, but always hysterical.
18175	2	a	War of the Worlds is pure popcorn escapism of the highest order if you want it to be, or more, but it's never less than thrilling.
18176	3	a	Ronan has immensely evolved to become this powerful jack-of-all-trades actress and Mary is another entry in her streak of incredible performances.
18177	9	a	Painfully unfunny, it's a ridiculous mess of a movie.
18178	5	a	One for devoted fans only.
18179	4	a	High-Tech, High-Class Entertainment...the cast of casts
18180	4	a	It's as if everyone involved in the film figured they could keep Hereafter from turning ghost-story hokey by making it grounded, beautiful and matter-of-fact. And it sort of works.
18181	0	a	"Bunuel was at the height of his powers with this satirical farce that explodes the distance between all things personal and political. ""The Discreet Charm Of The Bourgeoisie"" is a timeless and enigmatic masterpiece that psychologically alters its audience"
18182	5	a	To say Diane Lane would have trouble finding a date moves this movie into the science fiction realm
18183	9	a	Murray isn't cute in this role, he's just annoying, and that's something he's rarely been before.
18184	6	a	In spite of some laughs, and winning performances from Jennifer Aniston and Vince Vaughn, The Break-Up is more likely to make audiences squirm than cheer.
18185	3	a	More than a big-picture, end-of-the-world drama, it succeeds as a grave - and highly confined - journey through desperate emotional states.
18186	8	a	Frances McDormand is superb in this hard-hitting crime drama that grabs you and doesn't let you go. Brilliant.
18187	6	a	Predictable as any TV sitcom.
18188	5	a	Playing the funny friend, Kevin Hart stands out--a welcome relief from the low-simmering, Promise Keeper-esque ethos that fuels this piece.
18189	4	a	No se trata de una obra de arte ni una competidora a los Oscar, pero...A quin le importa eso cuando lo que uno busca es rerse un poco?
18190	2	a	A mildly diverting and harmless slice of family entertainment.
18191	5	a	A man's bi-polar disorder is supposed to give license to implausible and contrived histrionics. 
18192	2	a	succeeds largely on the basis of its mesmerizing surface
18193	0	a	Steven Spielberg shows the same kind of fire and passion he did in directing Schindler's List as the horror of slavery is laid bare in the crucible of the courtroom.
18194	3	a	One of Selma's clearest intentions is the promotion of interracial unity that is necessary when abuses have been imposed on any social or ethnic group. [Full review in Spanish]
18195	6	a	While this latest video game adaptation will most likely thrill its legions of fans with its graphic demonic depictions, the overblown plot deters the film from being a true fright fest.
18196	6	a	This is not the sumptuous visual feast Scott usually delivers, and that's likely intentional. He's going for character here, for connections, and he gets them for a while. Then he lets go.
18197	4	a	On balance Taking Woodstock--like Teichberg--takes after its immigrant American father, evincing a quiet humility in offering its rambling 'little perspective' of an emblematic happening that was almost everything it was cracked up to be.
18198	1	a	The movie is riveting. It reminds us not only of how far we have come as a society but how far we have yet to go.
18199	3	a	Informative -- and entertaining -- documentary.
18200	2	a	Embrace of the Serpent raises provocative questions about the depiction of native cultures onscreen and in Anthropological texts.
18201	5	a	Cianfrance's mesmeric eye for heartbreak is dulled here. The waters are muddied and the pull of The Light Between Oceans falters, despite some fine cinematography. 
18202	2	a	"A little edgier than ""High School Musical"" and a little smarter than the usual tween fare, ""Bandslam"" is a refreshing late-summer treat for tweens, teens, and their families."
18203	4	a	Colorful and energetically silly, a little scary and shot through with reassuring and worthy life lessons, it's an untaxing children's movie formula all the way.
18204	3	a	Woody Allen soars in Midnight in Paris. He suggests that no matter what era you're in you are unaware of its value, so you look back and see a better past. And the past, of course, is a selective illusion.
18205	7	a	A movie experience that lasts more than four hours. I wouldn't even want to make out with Jennifer Garner for more than, like, three hours.
18206	2	a	Don't go looking for any explanations. Just look, man.
18207	6	a	It's a frustrating complication of a movie with a sprawling story and grand ambitions -- and some truly grand acting -- that stumbles almost as often as it soars. Bummer.
18208	6	a	The Lazarus Effect begins with an intriguing premise then proceeds to squander all the early goodwill through a slow, inexorable descent into cheap horror gimmicks.
18209	3	a	To use Liam's words, it's f-ing brilliant.
18210	6	a	It does a good job of portraying the day-to-day life of these online obsessives, but we realize eventually that they are more interesting because they are online.
18211	0	a	This is one of the single most masterful pictures ever made.
18212	1	a	Two wry, sad, occasionally funny but always unflinching hours.
18213	6	a	James, at his best when he lets loose, plays his character a little too straight and so loses some of the movie's comic potential.
18214	1	a	Selma shows us where we were going. Watching it now, it's depressing how far from that path we've strayed.
18215	0	a	Essential Bond viewing. It should definitely be among the five Bond films to make someone a fan of the series.
18216	4	a	It's a solid, well-made family movie proving - as if it really needed to be said - that mum is the word.
18217	2	a	Michael Showalter's Hello, My Name Is Doris is a showcase for Field, reminding us that her comedic chops are just as impactful as her flair for the dramatic.
18218	5	a	[T]his comedy provides sporadic chuckles but, you'll pardon the expression, drones on for much of its running time.
18219	3	a	It's an acquired taste, perhaps, but Lewin was a genuine maverick talent.
18220	7	a	A WB teen melodrama with the lamest villain since the Gorton's Fisherman in I Know What You Did Last Summer.
18221	9	a	Man of the Year is a well-intentioned mess, a dated, yuk-it-up sloppy civics lesson with such a lack of conviction that it backs away from the very questions it poses.
18222	9	a	The only bright light in Timeline is that when the movie flops as hard as it must, perhaps it will be Walker's empty-headed career which takes the fall.
18223	3	a	If the Predator series had to be revisited, it could have ended up in far worse hands than Shane Black's.
18224	7	a	High production values and seemingly endless celebrity cameos only moderately elevate the scattershot satire of the Scary Movie franchise.
18225	1	a	Bright, entertaining and touching, this re-uniting of collaborators sports lush sets and costumery and Oscar level acting by several of the cast.
18226	1	a	What The Artist says about people who would like to sentimentalize and suspend the film industry in a bell jar is brilliant.
18227	4	a	Despite its middle-class magnolia feel in one respect, it has some sharp lines, twists and turns, revived characters, a neat score and good jokes about Warner Bros' stalwart Clint Eastwood.
18228	4	a	"Robin Williams' character can't decide when to be goofy and when to play it straight, and neither can this uneven ""what-if"" political comedy from writer-director Barry Levinson."
18229	6	a	Watching a movie about these wasted lives just made me feel like I was wasting mine for sitting through it.
18230	1	a	Sean Penn's gorgeous, tragic film is both an advertisement for wanderlust and a sobering cautionary tale.
18231	9	a	We have a sad attempt at action which fails miserably.
18232	4	a	Don't take the title as truth. This film is not as good as it gets, even though it is pretty darn good.
18233	5	a	Truncated from the show, Morse truly bizarre
18234	3	a	John Carter is a fun blockbuster. There is fun in its action scenes, in its jaw dropping imagery and especially in its surprising sense of humour that Andrew Stanton melds well with its brand of sci-fi spectacular. 
18235	4	a	While I, Robot is consistently entertaining and considerably smarter than your average summer action flick, it's never particularly exciting or emotionally compelling.
18236	3	a	Without question, Cianfrance is a filmmaker to be reckoned with. But he may need to forget that if he ever wants to make his best work.
18237	2	a	Though really nothing more than a high-toned soap opera,...the extraordinary performances elevate the material far above its treacle-drenched roots.
18238	4	a	Back is Chris Columbus, whose direction this time around has a purposely darker, more ominous look.
18239	1	a	Lovingly devoted to [Smith's] fans.
18240	3	a	Coppola gives CQ a sense of style and humor that makes the navel-gazing bearable. 
18241	4	a	Richard Spence's film doesn't have the courage to examine forcefully the issues at its center.
18242	6	a	It's a nice change of pace to find a sequel that doesn't merely try to remake the original, but Babe: Pig in the City lacks any of the original's endearing gentle spirit.
18243	2	a	While never as clever as it thinks it is, and lacking the internal logic that makes a Pixar project hum with indescribable brilliance, Bee Movie is still a witty, imaginative romp.
18244	4	a	A ragged but extremely amiable family comedy.
18245	2	a	The Edge of Seventeen is charming, thoughtful, a little crazy, often funny and sometimes touching in a very real way. It makes you feel that the high school movie genre still has merit, even in Hollywood hands.
18246	1	a	"Some films make you think, some make you cry, and others make you cringe. ""Deliver Us From Evil,"" which catalogs the destruction caused by a child-molesting Catholic priest, inspires all three reactions."
18247	6	a	A masquerade that doesn't work.
18248	3	a	Cheadle gives a performance of contained cool and bluff bravado, suggesting barely a hint of the rage you would expect from a man just out of a nine-year prison sentence.
18249	7	a	Lumbers from lardy exposition to climax overload.
18250	7	a	Painfully disengaged from anything human.
18251	4	a	A fairly turgid new drama that is anything but subtle, anything but surprising, but somehow it's truthful and honest, and the characters get under your skin.
18252	6	a	A slightly better-than-average David Spade summer comedy that imparts its fair share of laughs but bogs down after a solid start and never makes anything special out of its premise.
18253	8	a	[MacFarlane] has written himself the only part with anything to do. Putting him at the center of the film was suicide.
18254	3	a	For those able to tune in to its peculiar wavelength this deceptively simple film will prove another strangely profound [Van Sant] experience.
18255	1	a	This incredible adventure, with outstanding cinematography and amazing locations, just may be based on a true story. Then again, it may not.
18256	9	a	Maybe Unaccompanied Minors are the only ones who should go see this movie. Give them some soda, popcorn and milk duds, then let them rip up the theater, while Mom and Dad see something good
18257	0	a	There's a passion there that's hard to define except in terms of superb, totally fluid and, for the time, completely original and audacious film-making.
18258	8	a	Horny teen boys will totally dig it, everyone else will quickly realize this is simply fool's gold.
18259	6	a	Just when it seemed like Mr. Spielberg might be maturing into a filmmaker with some much-needed cynicism, you realize he's still just out there rounding up the dollars.
18260	3	a	Its silly, mannered contrivances nonetheless cast a nostalgic spell, and you find yourself drawn helplessly into the loopy, nonsensical story with strangely fretful anticipation.
18261	3	a	Monster doesn't sort everything out for you; it doesn't ask for your sympathy for Wuornos or your condemnation either. Emotionally, it's messy, but that's how life is.
18262	6	a	Take the funny away from Vaughn, and you've got Return to Paradise, and nobody wants to see that.
18263	3	a	Jackie Chan continues his late-blooming cinematic conquest of Hollywood with this oafish Wild West comedy, an often funny, formulaic, and sometimes bumbling, buddy movie.
18264	0	a	A film that managed to terrify a generation of children one minute, leave them eager to hunt for fossils in their backyard the next. 
18265	3	a	While the writing isn't as sharp or as funny as it is in Almodovar's best movies, so be it--it's a hell of a lot sharper and more interesting than most of the mass-produced movies coming out of Hollywood.
18266	6	a	Valentine isn't scary, but it is unsettling; not ultimately satisfying, but arresting in the moment.
18267	3	a	Although the casting of Cruise takes some getting used to, the film makes ample use of a strong supporting cast and a tightly knit story to maintain suspense.
18268	9	a	"Though even the most accomplished improvisers occasionally rely on shtick, Wayans simply recycles the same gags; his ""improv"" is all shtick, with little riffing and no sense of flow."
18269	6	a	Manipulative though it is, it doesn't generate much real emotion.
18270	3	a	Now and then, a scene will hit you in the gut, such as when Streep restyles Keaton's chemo wig. When sentiment is this honest, it's not hard to swallow.
18271	3	a	...a piffle graced by a cast it doesn't really deserve.
18272	5	a	It's disaster-by- the-numbers.
18273	6	a	The over-the-top tone invoked here doesn't come naturally and the spectacle and excess of professional sports - and the behind-the-scenes access - lacks an exaggerated visual sense.
18274	0	a	Writer/director Michel Hazanavicius' The Artist manages the trick of being both fearlessly loyal to an era of cinema that's long since passed and one of the few original motion pictures of its own time.
18275	3	a	Throw in a frenetic soundtrack, wonderful fashions, ample servings of sex, Sid Haig as a snarling henchman, and a fistful of moustaches and afros, then you have a classic of its time.
18276	4	a	I found the images occasionally striking, and sometimes bizarre, but I never connected with them in any meaningful way.
18277	4	a	Call me a moron, but I laughed so hard I inhaled my roach.
18278	4	a	When Tim and Eric's Billion Dollar Movie isn't funny, it's really not funny. When it's funny, it's terrifically deranged.
18279	3	a	Summer roars to a start with Fast Five which features some of the most spectacular action sequences seen on the screen in years.
18280	4	a	A mostly funny, occasionally charming, steadily foul-mouthed, frequently well-written, otherwise downright stupid comedy, enjoyable in spite of its unaccountably overblown length of over two hours.
18281	2	a	Magic realism takes hold in newbie director Colin Trevorrow's confident romantic comedy. 
18282	1	a	I loved the film more this time than I had the first time I watched it.
18283	4	a	Rock the Kasbah goes fierce to quietly touching and back to funny again.
18284	4	a	I would imagine most of the exaggerated praise Mile has received is in direct correlation to the stupid pictures most rap-rock-pop stars have made in vain attempts to become movie stars.
18285	4	a	Adults won't feel that angry at having seen it afterwards, while the little ones will be amused.
18286	5	a	They are trying to sell this as a family values film, and the humor is, for the most part, in the toilet. I'm not against this kind of humor - just this kind of marketing.
18287	3	a	Coming-of-age movie with mature themes, lots of profanity. 
18288	7	a	A loose-limbed, occasionally funny movie of many madly spinning teacups sunk by uninvested-in characters and niggling, wrongheaded details.
18289	1	a	Great fun as we endure scrape after scrape in this wild, near-hallucinatory landscape, and director Stanton finds the right balance of cheerful solemnity and cheeky humor.
18290	2	a	See what great actors Costner and Spencer can do with Mike Binder's uneven, but at times powerful and funny tale of race in America.
18291	6	a	The story is absolutely riveting and the casting right, but Bruve Beresford's filmmaking is uneven--he seems hampered by the conventions of the earnest, uplifting biopic gerne.
18292	3	a	Funny and entertaining at times, poignant at others, Kasi Lemmons and her talented cast have done a fine job immortalizing this little known radio icon.
18293	9	a	all that's missing is a senate debate and a pod race.
18294	6	a	An unsettling mixture of spectacular brutality and sentimentality that might make even Steven Spielberg blush.
18295	9	a	... Tries in vain to be both The Breakfast Club and Ocean's Eleven.
18296	4	a	Good freak-out fun for genre fans.
18297	6	a	A few moments do not make a new Mr. Smith Goes to Washington. Frank Capra can continue to rest in peace.
18298	6	a	What starts out with a sense of quirky fun loses direction and devolves into a mishmash of story lines.
18299	4	a	Sheer, unadulterated nastiness with no apologies.
18300	9	a	"Pardon me for not indulging filmmaker Paul Thomas Anderson again. ""Inherent Vice"" is shamefully incoherent and a waste of talent."
18301	4	a	MacFarlane's irreverent humor feels subdued without the jolt of animation that gave his previous big-screen effort, Ted, an extra oomph of shock and awe.
18302	6	a	Has more on the ball than it might have, including some surprisingly witty dialogue and a vivid sense of the pressure high schoolers feel in the face of all-important standardized tests.
18303	9	a	That this movie is how the Superman movie legacy ended would be a depressing thought if the movie weren't so endlessly hilarious.
18304	5	a	Along with their tickets to Wonderland, moviegoers should also be given a moist towelette. That way after the film they won't have to stand in line at the restroom to wash off the slime.
18305	1	a	An animated picture that can bear comparison to Pixar's best...In attitude and style it's distinctive and witty, walking a fine line between respectful homage and spoof.
18306	0	a	One of Hitchcock's underrated films, but even today, it is one of his most satisfying, hilarious, and intelligent films.
18307	4	a	Often entertaining, especially for those fans who loved The Lord of the Rings and have been waiting years to see more of Tolkien's Middle-earth onscreen.
18308	3	a	Writer-director Mike Binder, who drew one of Costner's best performances in The Upside of Anger, does it again here, and for good measure, he does the same for Spencer.
18309	1	a	One of the three best performances of McConaughey's career.
18310	4	a	Although McCandless's story is undoubtedly fascinating, and Penn's film contains moments of magic, it is a lesser piece of work because it prefers to accept its subject at face value rather than ask a few crucial questions.
18311	6	a	It bides time while watching extras watching Jolie do her fashion-model strut, her famous lips pursed just so. It doesn't help that she is so icily imperious that she seems more like a creepily gorgeous space alien than an actual human being.
18312	4	a	Centers on the difficulties of living with a sexually free spirit.
18313	3	a	"The stellar, English-language take on ""The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo"" burrows so deeply into the heads of its characters that even when they're just thinking, it's deeply thrilling."
18314	9	a	A piece of sclerotic all-star machismo about as exciting as Veterans' Arm-Wrestling Night at the Hollywood Bowl.
18315	2	a	With an appropriately jarring sense of energy, this James Brown biopic acutely captures the Godfather of Soul's iconic musical talents, although the fragmented script undermines any emotional kick in his story.
18316	3	a	I was left utterly charmed by it and I hope other big kids will give it a shot.
18317	8	a	Loud, crass, dumb and then even dumber.
18318	8	a	Thank you, [Joss], for creating this world, for seeing it through, and for giving us die-hard fans the closure we so desperately needed. You just earned yourself a lifetime pass from geeks everywhere.
18319	4	a	It's a lot of fun -- or to borrow from one of the royally connected writers who have reviewed the movie in the British press -- a bit of 'entertaining twaddle.'
18320	6	a	"A bit like ""Gone Girl,"" only without all the miserable, horrid people, which takes most of the fun out of it."
18321	6	a	In this labor of angst, directed by actor Tim Blake Nelson from his play, standard acting and 'plot' become reductive brackets.
18322	4	a	Supremacy is briskly paced and the screenwriting is fairly clever and crafty and salvages the film as a whole.
18323	9	a	An uneasy mix of four-hankie tearjerker and surreal romantic comedy.
18324	1	a	A triumph for Mr. LaBute as it is for its cast, because its success is so dependent on its sustaining a precarious balance between humor and pathos, realism and fantasy.
18325	6	a	It's a genuine effort by talented people that never quite comes off.
18326	4	a	Despite being occasionally hilarious, director Goran Dukic should have toned down the wackiness.
18327	0	a	Godard never lets us forget the artificiality of what we're watching, turning the film into a masterful meditation on cinema, capitalism, and sex.
18328	1	a	One of the films of the year for me.
18329	4	a	Messy, but still strangely appealing
18330	9	a	Amazingly, it is even worse than it looks.
18331	6	a	A bit overdone and overblown, the movie could have easily had a half-hour cut out of it, and no one would have noticed.
18332	0	a	After all the debate about this film...what Gibson has delivered is his own passionate vision.
18333	6	a	Too much, too soon, for Daisy and for us.
18334	8	a	...it's the story that's the real problem here. 
18335	5	a	I was so distracted by trying to locate beautiful Charlize in the ugly Charlize that I had trouble seeing Aileen Wuornos.
18336	4	a	Amusing comedy with likeable characters, colourful animation and several great gags, though the script isn't as focussed as it should have been.
18337	0	a	This movie is that stunning.
18338	0	a	This is the kind of movie that, even today, audiences immediately fall in love with. It has all the right ingredients: a smart script, a likable hero, a dash of romance, more than a touch of comedy, and a lot of fast-paced action.
18339	3	a	A torn-from-the-headlines tale of institutional racism and injustice in the Lone Star State of not-so-long-ago, American Violet might not be subtle, but it's certainly powerful.
18340	4	a	[Spielberg's] cold calculation doesn't work well with the hot injustice of slavery. Amistad would have been a better film from someone less thoughtful and more emotional...
18341	2	a	Credit must go to the writer-director for taking a unique approach rather than following the path of many a filmmaker by bastardizing traditional Japanese ideologies into a complete bloodbath of chop-socky or a surrealistic abstraction.
18342	4	a	Director David O. Russell is a little too chipper at times - breaking a restraining order is really no joke - but he brings a breeziness to this likeable tale of two misfits trying to make it work. 
18343	4	a	A very cute, whimsical idea even if it is not completely developed.
18344	5	a	Even by the standards of pop-moral parables passing for entertainment, this is bland stuff.
18345	5	a	Subtlety and sincerity go out the window in favour of crass stereotypes and easy jibes ...
18346	2	a	"Steven Soderbergh's ""Logan Lucky,"" written by Rebecca Blunt, is a down-home heist movie that comes across like a Southern-fried variation of one of his ""Ocean's"" films."
18347	2	a	The movie's concept is cool, the execution is taut and filled with suspense, but the resolution is badly flawed.
18348	9	a	You can surely tell this movie has been passed through the editing bay one too many times. 
18349	2	a	The foreplay was a little boring, but once they start Fockering, it works... It may be absurd and in poor taste, but that doesn't mean it can't still be funny.
18350	4	a	There are a multitude of sordidly fascinating directions a biopic on Alfred Hitchcock could take. So, when Sacha Gervasi's flat and frothy Hitchcock concludes, it's inevitably frustrating to find this film takes such a conventional path.
18351	4	a	An undemanding picture that goes down as well as the heroine's tasty ladoos.
18352	2	a	Its success is mainly because of the taut script, the good acting, and the effective directing.
18353	3	a	Surprising when actually analyzed. It's mostly buildup and only the last half hour is the ghost story. But it works.
18354	6	a	Eat Pray Love lies across the screen like a patient on life support whose ticker is about to tick its last tock.
18355	0	a	The movie hasn't aged a day in fifty years.
18356	7	a	It's all obtusely broad and ridiculous, and the dreaded 'life lessons' drag it out interminably.
18357	6	a	The good cast does what it can with the weak material, but the waste of talent only makes the film's total failure that much more regrettable.
18358	4	a	This is a movie that wants you to laugh and enjoy the music, not engage in analysis. 
18359	3	a	One of Richard Dreyfuss's best films....lovely stuff
18360	3	a	Plenty of action is here in this exciting remake of the earlier classic.
18361	9	a	Into The Wild gets lost in a self-indulgent wilderness.
18362	0	a	Cormac McCarthy's amazing novel was blessed with a usually impossible faithful adaption that translated the power of the words and weaved them into cinema.
18363	3	a	Packs considerable punch.
18364	4	a	Part of Smith and Berg's subvert-your-expectations game plan involves a major midfilm shocker, one that takes the movie to larger mythological places unrelated to Hancock's self-improvement quest.
18365	4	a	The whole thing is something you might read on a Saturday morning on a centre-page spread in the Daily Mail.
18366	3	a	An often-inspired smart comedy for kids, and a vintage Seinfeld laugh for adults.
18367	6	a	You not only have to be seriously testosterone- deprived to survive this film without embarrassment, you have to buy a romantic premise so ridiculously contrived that even Dr. Ruth might suspect someone was pulling her little leg.
18368	4	a	To their credit, Hanks and Wilson stuck to their guns, keeping Vardalos and her ethnicity in a film that is as much a triumph of the underdog and word-of-mouth as it is a box office success.
18369	3	a	American Hustle amuses with irony, music and wit. It tantalizes with danger but doesn't get violent. Its sexiness - there's grinding in washrooms, on tables and laps - is electric and fun. 
18370	5	a	Goes through familiar, harmless and occasionally amusing plot motions to explain why these birds are so angry, and why they're perfectly justified in going bin Laden on buildings.
18371	2	a	Sweetly sentimental, it's a low-key, feel-good family film.
18372	5	a	There are some good ideas here but they're buried under masses of conventional superhero dross and half hearted execution. This is one vigilante who should really just leave all the hard work to the police.
18373	3	a	No Country for Old Men isn't quite a masterpiece. It's simply an exercise in fine craftsmanship, whose craftsmen suit each other superbly.
18374	7	a	Well-acted but essentially go-nowhere little movie.
18375	3	a	The film is a tad too long but nevertheless is well acted and rather moving.
18376	0	a	Sofia Coppola's sophomore film is another exploration of delicate relationships and uncommunicated frustrations, this one in a beautifully composed atmosphere of isolation.
18377	6	a	Less a moral dilemma than a meditation on the differences between men and women in matters of social decorum.
18378	3	a	This is probably the most honest movie ever made about drug addiction.
18379	3	a	n unusually artful teen thriller, this film has a terrific combination of both light and dark touches from start to finish.
18380	7	a	full review at Movies for the Masses
18381	1	a	Despite any nay saying that I might work up, I enjoy watching the film. It has an uncanny ability to silence cynics like myself.
18382	4	a	An intriguing and important watch
18383	6	a	In American Dreamz, the people are stereotypes, and the context is fake: It's broad, it's thin, it's a big easy target. And ultimately, its dreamz are hollow.
18384	6	a	The story has a TV movie shorthand calculation and slightness.
18385	1	a	the film is more memorable for its quirky commingling of the epic and the intimate and its often startling visuals than for any of its big themes
18386	6	a	Thanks to its motley collection of story elements, settings, and acting styles, leaving this film is like getting off an amusement park ride you never wanted on in the first place.
18387	3	a	The movie is a strong reminder of the freedom of youth and the quest for pure adventure, one that looks to the stars and sees the possibilities are as bright as a child's own imagination.
18388	4	a	If you've seen the original, there's absolutely no difference in what happens. And very little reason to check it out.
18389	3	a	If it doesn't break any ground as a documentary, it's a heartfelt testament to a place he considers among the most hallowed halls of rock.
18390	3	a	It's very fast, very funny, and, as with all Black works, gleefully embraces genre cliches and turns them sideways.
18391	2	a	In an era of formulaic romantic movies that bear no resemblance to reality, The Break-Up offers a refreshing flipside.
18392	7	a	A truly inane and flat action comedy.
18393	2	a	The director has found a way to make an amusing fable about the costs and possibilities of freedom.
18394	3	a	Though occasionally overwrought, peerless sequences, such as the sublime flight through a bamboo forest, ensure House Of Flying Daggers is a work of real beauty.
18395	9	a	A vanity project that went nowhere.
18396	9	a	Badly written, poorly acted and surprisingly dull action thriller that substitutes loud gunfire for thrills and doesn't bother to develop the characters beyond their video game origins.
18397	3	a	This is a movie that raises the question of Bond's origins in a way we've never seen. 
18398	4	a	It was only a matter of time before some savvy producer saw the potential success inherent in the mixture of Bullock Bubble and Hugh Goo.
18399	7	a	Not only is it utterly unnecessary, it's also surprisingly bad.
18400	0	a	Plenty of very cool fight scenes, edited such that although they are fast-paced, you can actually see what's happening.
18401	3	a	That Tina Fey is funny is a given. That she gets inside the tangled mind of a complex woman on a perpetual hot seat is something new. 
18402	3	a	Silver Linings is consistently entertaining, with its scrappy, well-drawn characters, offbeat humor and indefatigable positive outlook.
18403	5	a	"Why is this day different from all others?"" is a question every Jewish family hears at the Passover seder. ""Why is this biopic different from all others?"" is a question that no one seems to hear in Hollywood."
18404	2	a	Jonah Hex could be bigger, louder and longer, with more special effects and faster cutting, but it errs on the side of simplicity. And to that, let's all raise a shotglass.
18405	0	a	Jaws is a perfect blend of set-pieces and story, its formula so hard to capture it's now near-mythical - filmmakers have been chasing it like Ahab chasing Moby Dick ever since.
18406	3	a	Sweet-tempered even while telling the story of a teenage girl's quest to lose her virginity, its heart is definitely in the right place...
18407	1	a	It's a nightmare that starts like a normal daytime drive and ends in a vortex-like sinkhole.
18408	1	a	This season's sure-fire sleeper hit.
18409	6	a	Bland, watered-down Seinfeld-ian humor for kids, amusing at best, grating at worst.
18410	4	a	The film has its sappy, predictable moments, but the gorgeous cinematography, apt direction and fine acting more than compensate. Think of it like Chariots of Fire on the golf course.
18411	5	a	The script gets less adventurous as it goes along, slowly shedding every intriguing idea and character detail for an utterly conventional final act.
18412	4	a	The destination doesn't feel worth the journey.
18413	5	a	This, [Roos'] second venture, suffers from some of the usual 'sophomore curse' pitfalls.
18414	0	a	It has intelligence, humor, drama and tragedy, dance numbers, amour and more, any of which will have appeal to someone out there.
18415	3	a	In the long run, The Good Girl will be remembered more as a chance for Jennifer Aniston to wet her acting chops than for anything else.
18416	0	a	It finds the gentle balance between traditional romantic comedy and artistic exploration of the laws of attraction.
18417	6	a	"The ""smart ass"" Shane Black and the not ""smart"" ass Shane Black are equally represented here. "
18418	1	a	It shows us the spectacle of what happened while explaining the many factors why. It is extraordinary in the way it balances the sensational with the sensible.
18419	2	a	American Graffiti still bears the mark of a superb filmmaking talent.
18420	2	a	[A] blast for anyone who appreciates scares, laughs and all-out entertainment in their summer flicks.
18421	2	a	It takes a bit to get going, but once it does, Fresh never lets up.
18422	1	a	It's a celebration worthy of the Sun King and a fitting way for both the designer and this unexpectedly involving documentary to literally and metaphorically bring it all back home.
18423	9	a	In fact, there may well have been one or two funny lines in Man of the Year, but by that point they were lost in the staggering repulsiveness.
18424	5	a	Kore-eda seems to have bitten off more than he can chew, delivering an uneven and ultimately superficial story of emotional maturation.
18425	6	a	Proves a pleasant enough way to while away a rainy afternoon.
18426	8	a	The cool charisma of Norton and Pitt is ... vital in seducing us, and both actors carry themselves confidently while speaking their dialogue with tough, throaty assurance.
18427	6	a	Those with a spiritually vibrant personal relationship to the story may find it as affirming as it is oppressive.
18428	6	a	Mary Queen of Scots is a film that will always gild the lily, which proves fatal since it's seemingly set in a garden of them.
18429	3	a	...a well-told ghost story...
18430	3	a	The movie is generous to a fault with its action, and the show-stopping set pieces are nothing short of incredible.
18431	4	a	Trey Parker and Matt Stone take such pleasure in being naughty that it makes their work more silly than smutty.
18432	3	a	...I was lulled by the relaxed storytelling.
18433	4	a	Lively, richly animated with intriguing motion capture fluidity, and pleasingly designed with special attention to sprawling Martian environments, the feature is nearly sunk by the efforts of co-star Dan Fogler.
18434	6	a	I, Robot is yet another summer entree in which good intentions are stymied by excessive bric-a-brac.
18435	0	a	It's an instant classic, as thrilling as it is quiet and hypnotic, and all the more powerful for anchoring a story with essentially three characters, none of whom share the frame together, being, how they are, one small step behind the other.
18436	6	a	Fleeced again.
18437	1	a	It is Easter Paradewith Fred Astaire that's the prime example of what made Frances Gumm our Judy Garland.
18438	2	a	Woody Allen's altar is the art of filmmaking, and Stardust Memories is his crisis of faith. 
18439	5	a	Liv Tyler is radiant, but the film itself suffers from the same self-indulgence that always hampers Bertolucci's work.
18440	6	a	American Violet feels less like life and unreasonably more like the movies.
18441	3	a	Paul Thomas Anderson's Inherent Vice provides a rush of pure hallucinogenic pleasure, but its logic is mighty hard to follow.
18442	10	a	defensive and frankly more than a little pathetic
18443	6	a	Owen Wilson just does what he does, and allows you to take it or leave it. You, Me and Dupree, then, suffers a slow start and trades too frequently in broad, garish strokes before rallying with some late atypical turns.
18444	4	a	Despite several flaws, the picture's bunch of anthropomorphized flies may be effective in turning kids attention from Miley Cyrus and Jonas Brothers and introducing them into the history and magic of space travel.
18445	9	a	"Casa de los Baby's"" is a frustrating and tedious experience to endure."
18446	6	a	The sight of these characters getting romantic is about as involving as watching two expensive mannequins kissing in a Macy's window.
18447	3	a	Resonant and fascinating.
18448	3	a	In his second year at the Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, the cinematic Harry Potter shows improvement. But he has a ways to go before earning top marks.
18449	0	a	The ambition is bracing, but critical hindsight obscures how exciting Malle's noir thriller is on its own terms.
18450	3	a	An arresting encapsulation of Brown's dichotomy of being at once a soulful singer and at the same time a man incapable of showing affection.
18451	3	a	This is a more adult romantic comedy, with humor that a more adult crowd can identify with, and those painful date moments that everyone can relate to.
18452	6	a	[Takes] itself too seriously, even while it contains all the trappings of one of the most lighthearted movie genres, the 'travel romance' or 'travel therapy' movie.
18453	1	a	Carey's celebratory approach to bawdy one-liners marries form with content.
18454	3	a	A spunky and hilarious story about the yearning for freedom in the heart of a very determined hen on a farm in the English countryside.
18455	5	a	Overrated and dull
18456	4	a	A troubling and sad portrait of a teenager who refuses to take moral responsibility for his actions.
18457	0	a	They really don't make them like this any more.
18458	5	a	National Security lacks the wit to do anything new and instead recycles tired jokes and attitudes.
18459	3	a	Logan Lucky is an entertaining romp powered by a smart script, strong performances across the board, and great direction.
18460	4	a	If anyone could do justice to the hugely popular Resident Evil series ... it's Anderson.
18461	2	a	As might be expected, director Jane Campion keeps an assertive woman as the film's center, a deliberately paced romance but hardly a chick-flick.
18462	0	a	"Carol"" possesses the same quiet, catlike powers of its magnetic title character: It swirls around to ambush you ... and make you swoon."
18463	3	a	With his latest, writer/director Judd Apatow proves he has a very unique talent - he can create a male arrested adolescent gross-out comedy while playing to and understanding the emotions of women.
18464	3	a	It's the perfect vacation-time movie: not a serious moment in its whole two hours but so crammed with laughter, thrills and cinematic sleight of hand that audiences will be sorry when it's over.
18465	6	a	"Midway through ""It Comes at Night"" you might wonder where it's headed, and it seems Shults may have asked himself the same question. It's a breathless thriller that will leave you gasping until it finally runs out of air itself."
18466	6	a	Eventually, you realize the movie isn't comprised of much more than premise, greeting-card wisdom and coincidences, and its two hours start to grow long.
18467	3	a	A very British Bond, and also a very personal one. 
18468	5	a	A war-set comedy-drama as messy and ineffective as an Afghan suicide donkey.
18469	3	a	You won't need to keep a pack of tissue at the ready here, but Bolt does have some lump-in-the-throat moments courtesy of a vividly drawn, huggable main character you grow to love.
18470	5	a	Kids could do worse than check in at the two- star Hotel For Dogs this half-term.
18471	4	a	Despite its heavy undertones of satire, irony and social comment, this entertaining film is basically a caper thriller.
18472	3	a	Almodovar, whose work here has newly sophisticated polish, appreciates the dark twists of this story along with the eroticism that bring heat to all the scheming.
18473	4	a	Alas, the fun does not last. Once the concert starts and Elliot has his inevitable LSD trip and introduction to free love, the film drops the comedy for a needless coming-of-age denouement.
18474	3	a	The spirit of Stand By Me lives on in The Kings of Summer, a poignant and frequently hilarious coming-of-age film about three teenage friends yearning for freedom and independence.
18475	1	a	The next best thing to riding a sub to the bottom of the North Atlantic and prowling around the sunken ocean liner.
18476	3	a	Though the movie seems built to launch an ongoing franchise, Whedon avoids bowing to the status quo, daringly taking his story in uncompromising directions.
18477	1	a	Like Dr. King did, the film captures your mind and your heart as it entertains, the way great movies often do.
18478	9	a	A weary Madame Bovary rehash set in rural Ireland.
18479	2	a	McDonagh's cast is superb, though - Harrelson provides the film's moral core while McDormand's controlled fury brings focus to the various plot contraptions. 
18480	2	a	It doesn't always work, but it does set itself resolutely apart from the pack, and if you look closely, you can spot the occasional moment of genius.
18481	2	a	Jennifer Westfeldt and friends ask: Do children ruin every relationship? No, just many of them.
18482	7	a	Cold Creek Manor will leave you cold. That's an easy but totally honest summation.
18483	5	a	While the result is neither poetry nor politics, it does rather gleefully turn a few dumbass guy's-guy movie comedy conventions on their heads.
18484	3	a	Team America is an assault on good taste, but it is so relentlessly funny you'll not only welcome the attack, but come back for seconds and thirds.
18485	2	a	The movie may not bring anything earthshaking to the zombie sub-genre, but as an exercise in intestine-munching horror, it's largely successful.
18486	3	a	Admirably ambitious animated ode to Spaghetti Westerns featuring a Johnny Depp-voiced lizard as the unlikely hero.
18487	5	a	Internal Affairs is all stylish visuals and no substance whatsoever. That may be an attempt to hide the silliness of Henry Bean's first-time screenplay, but it doesn't work.
18488	4	a	The House with a Clock in Its Walls makes an adequate early Halloween treat for children who enjoy spooky/scary movies that don't go too far over-the-top.
18489	4	a	Second and least successful entry in the Harry Palmer series has its moments.
18490	0	a	"The experience of watching ""Carol"" is like being pulled into a different place, real and not real, like the best movies, like being in love."
18491	1	a	The casting is high quality, the script - with a tantalizing mystery at its heart - is particularly well-crafted and the story hits all the right emotional notes in delivering a funny, warm-hearted and life-affirming tale.
18492	2	a	An odd interruption in the Bond canon that's neither an unsung masterpiece nor an unmitigated disaster. It's half terrific, half terrible -the former most often when George Lazenby shuts up and Peter Hunt's masterful action instincts take over.
18493	4	a	It's possible to admire the grand, sweeping ambitions poured into the production of Agora without having much use for the movie itself.
18494	1	a	This is vintage David Cronenberg, but an even more sophisticated, refined version.
18495	2	a	Really entertaining, and dark and twisted.
18496	4	a	"The musical numbers offer some of the strongest moments in ""Country Strong."" The story's offstage dramas, however, are like a country song with every other verse removed."
18497	3	a	For this is a first-rate cooking of a western recipe-not a great Western film nor a creation, but an excellent putting of heat to a fine selected blend.
18498	4	a	Liman adds some brash, and occasionally subtle, touches to the spy-on-the-run formula, without ever quite managing to transcend the cliches.
18499	4	a	The problem with The Curious Case of Benjamin Button is that it aims for profundity and merely hits homespun wisdom.
18500	4	a	Freeman has been well cast as the young Bilbo, providing a sense of British indignity accompanied by his slightly gormless, gob-smacked facial expressions.
18501	5	a	Field delivers an artfully measured performance as Doris, first lulling us into believing she'll settle into a goofy stereotype, then stirring up subtle qualities to create a character who is alternately funny and tragic, chipper and anguished.
18502	3	a	It might be a dirge of a film, but it's a beautiful, textured dirge that hangs in the air long after its last note has been played.
18503	2	a	A slap to the face of Wester culture for letting traditions like the ones in the Amazon being destroyed. [Full review in Spanish]
18504	5	a	All in all, the film just tries to do too much.
18505	3	a	Bizarre Hollywood dream factory. Teens only.
18506	4	a	I like Bullock. I like Grant. Script is serviceable. There have been far worse romantic comedies this year.
18507	0	a	Danny Boyle's Trainspotting is a blast of ice-cold water across a sweaty brow; it's a lively, vibrant and pulsatingly addictive movie.
18508	3	a	The story's strong point isn't psychological depth or complex relationships, but brainy scientists trying to think their way out of a box that grows smaller every minute.
18509	9	a	The cast just about escapes with its dignity after this derivative, predictable urban thriller.
18510	3	a	Apatow's marriage of guyville and girlworld is not one made in heaven -- he's too pragmatic to observe the rom-com conventions. What's potent about Knocked Up is its down-to-earthiness.
18511	3	a	The movie is funny, gentle, and true.
18512	3	a	Over-the-top, bloody good fun.
18513	10	a	"There might be a funny movie in a story about a crime fighter who's in it only for the publicity, but ""The Green Hornet"" isn't it."
18514	3	a	an irreverent overview of the current geopolitical mess
18515	3	a	There are hundreds of clever details and imaginative flourishes to make it worthy of being put into the same category as the films to which it so charmingly pays tribute. 
18516	4	a	Inimitable, irrepressible and possibly the coolest man alive, Jackson ranks as the best reason to catch this Hoosiers in the 'hood. Happily, he's not the only one.
18517	5	a	Seriously dumbed-down version of the novel.
18518	7	a	Even for a movie based on a splatterrific shoot-'em-up videogame, Doom is doomed.
18519	4	a	A better-than-average found-footage thriller...
18520	5	a	Instead of a nasty story with life lessons, what we have is testosterone-driven lunatics who enjoy pain, the sight of blood, and hearing bones crunch. David Cronenberg might have succeeded with the material -- David Fincher doesn't.
18521	3	a	"Palo Alto"" is a very strong first feature, prioritizing mood over message."
18522	4	a	An amiable-enough Spade vehicle that lacks that certain something, but still manages to generate its fair share of giggles.
18523	3	a	...a highly visual domestic horror film, a sui generis experience
18524	6	a	The move works reasonably well as a thriller, but falls apart in other areas. 
18525	3	a	A high-end horror film, very clever, funny and scary.
18526	5	a	Stupid movie, right? But kid-friendly.
18527	6	a	Like the coup whose story it tells, Valkyrie is a near miss, failing to sweep us along for what should have been a dramatic ride.
18528	6	a	Just another movie that could be titled Sad Guy in New York.
18529	3	a	Unashamedly emotional, it either totally grabs you or leaves you cold.
18530	2	a	Now Director Paul Feig, and writers Jacob Meszaros and Mya Stark have managed to make something which could be very tired, something rather cute.
18531	3	a	After Shrek the Third's flatulence jokes, the return of that Seinfeldian wit brings animation up a level.
18532	9	a	Flight of the Phoenix ignores the human drama to focus on cockamamie setbacks that are harder to swallow than the plane's motor oil.
18533	2	a	Maybe being pretty darn dumb is part of its charm.
18534	1	a	A fascinating and intimate look to the world of fashion and the lif of a genious. [Full review in Spanish]
18535	6	a	If you're old enough to see how shamelessly manipulative and predictable it is, you're too old for it.
18536	3	a	"It is hard not to feel spine tingles with numbers such as ""Sunrise, Sunset"", ""Miracle of Miracles"", or ""Do You Love Me?"
18537	5	a	The film's most inventive running gag involves what must be a MacFarlane obsession with the classic stiff subjects of Old West photographs.
18538	3	a	A very touching film that features great performances all around. This is the type of movie you'll watch and wonder why you've never heard more about it.
18539	4	a	Middleweight, non-intelligence-insulting fare right to the core, Bleed For This keeps you squarely in your seat, but barely once excites you enough to leap up out of it.
18540	3	a	Clint Eastwood is at his macho, insubordinate best in this exuberant, salty military movie with more memorable lines and funny moments than most comedies.
18541	3	a	Ravishingly pleasurable to look at purely as visual abstraction, even before we get in the business of the erotic depictions.
18542	3	a	A soothing buddy movie.
18543	2	a	Well executed action thriller by Das Boot German director Petersen, which is rather weak in plot and characterization.
18544	4	a	This umpire calls Hardball out at first base.
18545	3	a	... for fans of the series and the closure it deserved...
18546	6	a	It's all vapid snark, didactic sermonizing and bewildering shock tactics.
18547	4	a	The authenticity of Nebraska washes over you in this wave of how every road trip you've ever taken was just captured in slightly less than two hours.
18548	5	a	A damp squib, thrown fizzling into the memory arena of the world's pioneer rock festival.
18549	9	a	I, Frankenstein isn't just a bad movie--it is an abysmally awful one. Someone in production should have realized it didn't work in the script phase and put a stop to it before it went this far. 
18550	3	a	A hilarious and crazy parody that takes its raw material very seriously and moves between the ridiculously sublime to give the spectator memorable moments. [Full review in Spanish]
18551	1	a	[Jane Campion's] first full-fledged, no-doubt-about-it, stone-cold masterpiece.
18552	4	a	It would almost come across as a fairly routine indie/Sundance-type movie if not for the superior acting and subtle characterization.
18553	0	a	Nothing lasts.Or does it? 'The Curious Case of Benjamin Button' gives us an interesting perspective on the human condition - on aging, loss, and mortality.
18554	3	a	"Long after the movie was finished I found myself drifting back to ""Palo Alto""...it doesn't have a tidy wrap-up, and that's one of the many traits of high school life it gets right."
18555	3	a	A very funny closing chapter to the Blood And Ice Cream trilogy, The World's End is more than satisfying. It's hilarious, action-packed and has more one liners than you can shake a pool cue at.
18556	1	a	There's an exhilarating sadness to it all that amounts to cinematic poetry.
18557	0	a	A rarity in that it is an improvement over the Swedish language original, this intricately-woven, edge-of-your-seat whodunit is as graphic and grisly as it is cerebral and mind-bending. 
18558	0	a	Intelligent filmmaking is rare enough these days, and intelligent films taking an ethically probing approach to the war on terror even rarer.
18559	9	a	I don't know why she does it.
18560	6	a	While this new Alfie is far from PC, giving him even an ounce of sympathy misses the point.
18561	3	a	Sayles sees like a documentarian, showing us the women, listening to their stories, inviting us to share their hopes and fears and speculate about their motives.
18562	0	a	Does the film deliver? Undeniably yes. Snakes On A Plane may, in fact, be in the top three most supremely entertaining films I have ever seen.
18563	8	a	certainly the animated movie of the year and, for my money, one of the best times you'll have at the movies all year.
18564	3	a	The boy-dog formula takes viewers to surprising places and ends up an enchanting character study.
18565	3	a	I complain all the time about seeing the same ideas repeated in films over and over again, but The Bourne Identity proves that a fresh take is always possible.
18566	3	a	The heart of the movie beats like a drum, and got me in step from the start.
18567	4	a	While the finished product is not without merit it's difficult to erase the bitter taste of squandered opportunities.

18571	9	a	a failure, and a highly flawed one at that.
18572	6	a	A lot more of the same, although sporadically funny.
18573	6	a	Fincher has made a movie that is not only wholly redundant in light of the original but also one that is worse than its already problematic predecessor.
18574	2	a	Delicate laughs ensue ... with some meaningful moments of emotion popping up as needed in this unusually framed, slice-of-life tale. 
18575	2	a	The solid performances and central conflict keep the film consistently, if not constantly, compelling.
18576	9	a	Even Space Chimps was better.
18577	3	a	Succeeds because at its core it is about the very different pressures very different young adults face, and the test that insists on judging them as one and the same.
18578	1	a	There's an almost ethereal rawness to this film that gets way under the skin.
18579	3	a	The plot familiar, the direction is only mediocre, and the photography is flat, but the acting is top notch.
18580	2	a	A thought-provoking horror film that packs a visceral wallop.
18581	3	a	A flawed but noble look at race.
18582	0	a	Will rightfully be considered a landmark achievement not only for the passionate responses it is causing but because Gibson was able to give one of the oldest and best-known stories in literature such contemporary resonance and power.
18583	5	a	There's little to distinguish this oddly mean-spirited comedy.
18584	4	a	At its best in the taut opening and in the third act, when the pieces finally come together. In between, the episodic story sags a bit.
18585	1	a	Frankly, the story isn't remotely as interesting as Cage. Nothing is.
18586	0	a	The transfer to the IMAX screen diminishes none of the film's drama, which was always much more about human emotions than technology.
18587	3	a	Who could imagine an all-out bloody massacre to be this hilarious?
18588	0	a	An extraordinary motion picture that harnesses spellbinding emotional discharge and enthralling disgust, using two of the most talented and captivating stars of today to bring to the screen a masterwork of domestic isolation.
18589	1	a	Its strength comes from vibrant, close-to-the bone acting, particularly by Diane Keaton in her Oscar-nominated role.
18590	6	a	Dickie Roberts, while certainly not a good movie, is a perfectly affable summer comedy, filled with nearly nonstop physical comedy and an impressive sprinkling of has-been celebrity cameos.
18591	3	a	Alexander Payne is back in prime, prickly form with Nebraska, a marked improvement over his soggy, false-feeling melodrama The Descendants.
18592	1	a	Julianne Moore is wonderfully good as Alice and her performance will bring a tear to many eyes.
18593	3	a	...a honey pot of a film that fans of Pooh are going to adore.
18594	3	a	Lynn Collins's feisty Dejah Thoris is the best kick-ass sci-fi princess since Leia
18595	1	a	Brad Pitt's performance is crucial, and he rips into the character with a frightening sense of unhinged egomania, violently subverting the Redford-lite pretty-boy image with which so many wanted to associate him
18596	3	a	Overall this is a far tighter film, from the simpler but ever delightful set design to the sharp script and economical running time.
18597	4	a	For Chan, it's a step in the right direction, although he has yet to be given the opportunity to bring the full force of his charisma to bear on an English speaking audience.
18598	1	a	The Best of Youth is no masterpiece, but it has enough truthful, moving moments to make it worthwhile.
18599	4	a	The film is a reminder of the old Hollywood sword-and-sandal films of grandeur and muscle and frivolity.
18600	3	a	Beginning at the end of the traditional meet-court-marry-impregnate chain of romantic events, Apatow's clever comedy is a romance in reverse, and it works.
18601	4	a	This is the most Shane Black movie Shane Black has ever made.
18602	3	a	[Theron] captures the essence of the woman, a lifelong victim who preys on her customers with the determined sadness of someone who has finally snapped inside.
18603	5	a	The actors swim well, but emote poorly.
18604	5	a	At least six different movies are stuffed into this Nicolas Cage vehicle.
18605	2	a	More than adequately serves as a no-nonsense escapist action thriller.
18606	6	a	While they let Williams go, which is good, they don't give him enough time to do so, which isn't. What remains is a hollow political polemic with great acting.
18607	4	a	Menashe is a pretty basic story regarding child custody, but it benefits from the setting and the unfamiliarity of the Hasidic Jewish community
18608	3	a	A very cool, sly comedy thriller of one femme fatale and three chumps.
18609	5	a	A chaotic, shambling satire.
18610	3	a	... for all its unlikely and fantastical nature, Film Stars is a lovely love story.
18611	4	a	Jane Got a Gun successfully operates as a Western with its own flourishes of home-invasion plot threading and a unique role reversal take on the genre regarding gender
18612	9	a	Unfortunately happens to star Demi Moore.
18613	4	a	Basically harmless and grudgingly funny.
18614	4	a	A thrilling but frivolous ride.
18615	2	a	Edward Shults's work plays with a slow cinema, in which dream sequences flirt with the reality of a family in danger. However, the end of the film leaves us with much more doubts than answers. [Full review in Spanish]
18616	6	a	Broken Embraces is Almodovar on autopilot.
18617	5	a	If only every bee were named 'Chris Rock' the movie would have the stinging humor it sorely lacks.
18618	6	a	All you need to know about the character is he's really crazy and carries a chain saw. And he's got an even crazier uncle who all but steals the film.
18619	4	a	Director Marc Forster stitches together a lovingly overstuffed comedy that reflects the best and worst of its hero.
18620	3	a	It's not a superhero film; it's an exuberant anti-superhero film that exists with no agenda except to delight.
18621	3	a	Whether it is truth, fiction or, most likely, a little of each, the story Weir tells is a powerful parable of man's charge for freedom and his humbling by nature.

18624	7	a	[The film features] nonstop slapstick, potty jokes, and sexual gags.
18625	1	a	Hollywoodized to the extent of depicting President Lyndon Johnson as an obstructionist to the African-American cause. Nonetheless, 'Selma' is compelling cinema. 
18626	3	a	There's an emotional logic to this structure, though, which envisions the late Brown's life as a series of moments of unmitigated ego and irresolvable pain.
18627	6	a	The kill-or-be-killed twist could have made this the best Destination since the first, but the idea is woefully underdeveloped even if the film is nevertheless gorier and smarter than the diabolical fourth instalment.
18628	2	a	Listening to the older crowd after the film had ended, they couldn't have missed the point any more if the soundtrack to Patch Adams had been played over the top of the film.
18629	6	a	Full of local flavor.
18630	3	a	It is fascinating, lyrical filmmaking and it demands multiple viewings to wring the most out of it.
18631	4	a	Not his finest, but that's proof of how great this man is.
18632	4	a	You forget that Russell once made such impenetrable navel-gazing twaddle as I Heart Huckabees, and simply revel in the fact that American Hustle is often deliriously good fun.
18633	3	a	Minimalism defines this revisionist and challenging noir- Western, a welcome artistic departure from Jarmusch's increasingly tired and tiresome Downtown New York sensibility.
18634	1	a	It would be enjoyed by anyone who has been married, is married, wants to get married, or knows someone who is married.
18635	5	a	The original had us glued to our sears with tension but here the drama doesn't induce any goosebumps. Also, the film is choppily edited and hence the narration looks disjointed.
18636	5	a	Much of the book's cartoony charm gets lost in the conversion to live action, and we're left with a coming-of-age comedy that just feels aged.
18637	0	a	A true treasure of cinema from one its masters.
18638	3	a	Loach and frequent writing partner Paul Laverty are not greatly growing here, but once again their integrity is sterling.
18639	6	a	This sharp-looking but unimaginative adventure hasn't the wit of similar kiddie flicks.
18640	3	a	Love, Simon is a funny, heartfelt, and truly touching teen romantic comedy that instantly becomes a modern classic for today's generation.
18641	3	a	Enjoy Vantage Point while the thrills last, and try to ignore the 'what the heck?' stretches of credulity in the final reels.

18657	6	a	Lemmons' refusal to go for cheap laughs and easy uplift places her at odds with the cliched and predictable aspects of her own screenplay. The movie overall is earnest and respectful but unexciting
18658	3	a	A deliriously sleazy black comedy thriller that is resolutely adult in tone and content but overflows with wonderful performances, fast-paced thrills and memorable dialogue.
18659	6	a	There's something tonally off about the master of anxiety, neurosis and disquiet being depicted in a story this cozy.
18660	3	a	The result is a mature and challenging motion picture, and something that will stick with viewers after the screen has gone dark.
18661	7	a	Doesn't even cut it as a made-for-television movie.
18662	2	a	It's too bad that Burroughs' ideas don't seem quite as fresh now that others have outraced Carter to the big screen.
18663	5	a	Adrian Lyne directs this film as Zalman King might direct an episode of One Life to Live

18666	6	a	The picture would be better suited to public television, where its modest character will be more at home and its didacticism perhaps less blatant.
18667	3	a	The ultimate destination creates the opportunity for Penn to draw up a summation for his protagonist's journey, and it's a moral that should satisfy those viewers looking for meaning and order.
18668	4	a	"While ""John Carter"" is undeniably silly, sprawling and easy to make fun of, it's also playful, genuinely epic and absolutely comfortable being what it is. In this genre, those are virtues as rare as a cave of gold."

18674	2	a	The World's End isn't as unique as Pegg and Wright's prior 'Cornetto' entries but it's still a solid film that should satisfy returning series fans and comedy lovers.
18675	5	a	a Hollywood whitewashing of a potentially explosive story

18691	2	a	"Lean, mean, funny, and chockablock with fast-twitch demolition spectacle, ""The Expendables"" represents a grand finale for several generations of action cinema stars. "
18692	3	a	"One important reason why Snakes on a Plane works is ""supercool"" Samuel L. Jackson. Quite honestly, I don't think the film would be as good if it were Josh Lucas, or Dennis Quaid, or Kurt Russell fighting the snakes."
18693	7	a	Plodding, emotionally inert, overlong, badly framed, inappropriately scored and polluted with an ensemble who try to outdo each other with bad performances.
18694	3	a	A satire on American infantilism - or an example of it? Either way, it's funny.
18695	2	a	This film's unhinged plot constantly catches us off guard with its bizarre twists and turns, all of which are grounded on the hapless characters.
18696	3	a	Mystic River draws its power from the shadow murder throws over everyday life.
18697	3	a	Bolstered by its fiercely assured script and direction, Wonderland's cast soars, with Kilmer perhaps doing his career-best work.
18698	3	a	There is a definite feeling that these are old friends that we are being reunited with, and I hope new viewers don't feel left out.
18699	4	a	If Total Recall isn't as much fun as I'd hoped, it's not as dreary as I'd feared. I wouldn't call it totally awesome, but it's far from being a total loss.
18700	5	a	Anodyne family fare, Hotel is awash with all-American sentimentality but the many cute canines might just make it bearable for younger viewers.
18701	3	a	Thankfully, it's nicely made... well acted, as funny as it is gently moving, and genuinely intriguing, as we watch Simon respond to online posts by the mysterious 'Blue', who admits that he is gay but won't reveal his identity. 
18702	3	a	Knocked Up proves that hit comedy doesn't have to dumb down for its demographic.
18703	6	a	"Billion Dollar Movie"" has the feel of improv that reached for design after the fact, in editing, and never quite found it."
18704	3	a	Despite its levity and wild shifts in tone, The Dressmaker is a heartbreaking tragicomedy. It's also imaginative, funny, colourful, poignant and unforgettable.
18705	3	a	[A]n outstanding literary adaptation and a superb example of Hollywood fare at its most intelligent and sharply honed.
18706	6	a	The way this comedy has been edited by Peter S. Elliot, presumably at the urging of director Tim Story, the shots barely hold themselves for two or three seconds before slam-cutting away to a pushy reaction shot.
18707	5	a	A riotously awful biopic rife with stereotypes and boxing movie cliches.
18708	4	a	"Moore's performance, with all its subtleties and nuances, demands recognition, even if it's the only thing about ""Alice"" worth remembering. "
18709	1	a	The strangest biographical film ever made is also one of the most charming, melancholy and quirkily humorous films of the year.
18710	3	a	"Carol"" surprisingly also finds Haynes at his most hopeful that such loves can survive."
18711	2	a	A flighty shrimp and grits caper that willfully evokes the best - and a little of the worst - of [Soderbergh's] billion dollar-grossing [Ocean's] trilogy.
18712	4	a	If you are new to these people, it feels like it takes forever to get to its tiny point.
18713	4	a	It makes you extremely grateful that Smell-O-Vision was never perfected.
18714	3	a	One of Demme's most engaging films.
18715	0	a	A chilling, cautionary expose' of Orwellian dimensions.
18716	3	a	Lazenby is very weak, but the movie is rather good
18717	3	a	The Imitation Game both brings to life and pays tribute to Turing's history-altering and pioneering work that paved the way for modern computing.
18718	9	a	Inept in nearly every phase of filmmaking, the film's pace is lumbering, there's a shocking lack of authenticity and its messages are mixed at best.
18719	4	a	There is a limit to how many times one human can watch toothless, malnourished men stumble around the desert bitching about communism and a lack of borscht.
18720	5	a	The movie as a whole is a leap backwards, assembled out of a story as thin as noodles, and stunts so overproduced and bloated that they leave us staring on in disbelief.
18721	3	a	An extremely well-made but rather muddle-headed film that delivers a solid blow to the belly, yet does not stand up to rigorous intellectual examination.
18722	4	a	...it surprised me by actually being a lot better than it deserved to be.
18723	3	a	"Ralph Breaks the Internet"" is almost always inspired in the moment. The story team has a good idea that worked in the first film and gives us more of that, in a much bigger playing field."
18724	5	a	A faulted comedy with a great pace that aims for cute and occasionally succeeds. 
18725	3	a	A surprisingly quirky and touching romantic comedy.
18726	7	a	As bad as Hannibal Rising is -- and believe me, it's terrible -- this fictional biography of the beloved Dr. Hannibal Lecter could have been worse.
18727	8	a	Let me just say up front what a pleasure it is to watch a well-crafted film in which not a word or a gesture is wasted.
18728	6	a	Events proceed on a thoroughly predictable course in Robert Perez's formulaic screenplay.
18729	5	a	It's Poseidon Adventure, Alien Resurrection, any heist movies, Jaws, and a little art house flick called Titanic all in one.
18730	4	a	The former swingers settle for standard gags in the moderately amusing Couples Retreat
18731	1	a	Indirectly scolds today's meek populace for letting its war-minded government rage unchecked.
18732	5	a	It's ... undeniably disappointing when a movie called Fun Mom Dinner isn't, well, much fun.
18733	2	a	The most remarkable thing about Love, Simon is how comfortable it feels with just being what it is: an ordinary teen romantic comedy. And yet, it feels so very special. [Full Review in Spanish]
18734	9	a	Cox aims for a superficial overview of swindling, fragile egos, and revenge, trying to play it cool with real-world horrors that deserve more frightening screen representation.
18735	3	a	Smartly scripted, convincingly atmospheric morality fable in which Hartnett, usually insubstantial as a good guy, plays a convincingly flawed character galloping toward the precipice.
18736	1	a	An entertaining seriocomic bauble that richly mines for laughs the pained regret and fumbling desires of its characters in much the same manner as Alexander Payne.
18737	4	a	An artifact from way back when Steven Seagal was novel and therefore sort of cool.
18738	4	a	Diehard fans should be warned that the movie will not deliver the nostalgic hit they are hoping for. This is not necessarily such a bad thing. At least a new generation is being exposed to Astro Boy.
18739	9	a	The jokes are so tired and irritating in the film, I found myself anticipating the funny gags from the trailers because those were the only ones that were remotely humorous.
18740	2	a	The Artist is a witty little confection, bound to please but not necessarily to linger in the mind.
18741	3	a	Nicolas Cage ... gives some more of his best work.
18742	0	a	Still one of the scariest, most unnerving films ever made.
18743	9	a	A tonal disaster.
18744	5	a	There's no real need for Factory Girl; just go pick up that copy of Heat.
18745	5	a	There are a lot of outrageous, raunchy, and insulting comments from caricatured family members, but, surprisingly, considering that most of them are played by stand-up comics, very few actual jokes.
18746	1	a	Proof once again that if the filmmakers just follow the books, they can't go wrong. Better effects, better acting and a hilarious Kenneth Branagh. An excellent sequel.
18747	3	a	The writer, Susannah Grant, director Joe Wright, and especially the two superb leading actors all give the film life and humanity.
18748	1	a	The 'nature vs. nurture' debate rarely explores each side so literally and so closely.
18749	3	a	As on-screen Allen stand-ins go, Wilson is definitely one of the more effective ones, recognizably channelling those Allen neuroses within his own established persona and distinct comic rhythms.
18750	7	a	Trite, unfunny, boring and a waste of everyone's talent.
18751	9	a	Not only do we rarely get to participate in the fun -- fun being the chance to watch demon guts splattered across the walls -- but there's barely any to be found.
18752	3	a	The kind of don't-ask- too-many-questions action-hero movie where the humor is tasty and the FX are wicked-cool.
18753	6	a	Rochester may have been a cultural visionary, but the movie reduces this notion to a parable of bad-boy celebrity hitched to an uninteresting love story.
18754	3	a	Director Chris Columbus and company have done a stand-out job of capturing the imagination if not the detail of those books.
18755	1	a	Thematically rich, impeccably crafted, and intellectually stimulating, the only area where this movie falls a little short is in its emotional impact.
18756	5	a	Fewer laughs than the average episode of ITV's Benidorm.
18757	9	a	While it aspires to be cinematic junk food, the picture is relentlessly moronic, eschewing B-movie thrills to wallow in Z-movie production achievements.
18758	3	a	A lighthearted, charming nougat for romantics.
18759	5	a	The film presents itself as worthy, but it's ultimately boring. [Full Review in Spanish] 
18760	6	a	There are so many diversions in Failure to Launch, it's as if the movie is bored by its own story.
18761	9	a	Sophomoric silliness.
18762	5	a	The badly miscast Delevingne communicates nothing to suggest the sway she holds over her lovesick admirer. She's an enigmatic blank page, a paper actress in a paper movie.
18763	5	a	The Soloist is all artifice. It should have stayed true to the art involved.
18764	5	a	Elegant and cinematic, but at the same time a spontaneous work of verite, The Rider breaks its own cinematic ground. 
18765	0	a	A classic and unforgettable thriller.
18766	6	a	Producer Adam Sandler must have though so little of the film that he didn't even see it fit for a Rob Schneider cameo.
18767	4	a	A cheeky little commentary on modern consumption, The Joneses offers an uneasy balance between what's funny and what's not, staying just edgy enough to be uncomfortable while hitting its targets.
18768	4	a	Much of our enjoyment of a movie is based on expectations - and this title is misleading. It's actually a low-key, lightweight, occasionally amusing yet shallow story.
18769	6	a	The new Fantastic Four might have been palatable if we hadn't already met a certain wall crawler or Caped Crusader on screen.
18770	3	a	Overall, the movie's imaginative effects and ideas win the day.
18771	8	a	The performances are extraordinary. [Full Review in Spanish]
18772	1	a	I'm here to tell you that it didn't disappoint.
18773	5	a	Reign of Fire is basically one great set piece surrounded by thickets of iron filings, oily hair and knotty-pine acting.
18774	4	a	The Frontier serves as an excellent showcase for its actors as well as a striking calling card for Shai's directorial chops. However, the flaws in its storytelling and character development do keep it from being as great a film as it could have been.
18775	4	a	If I saw ALIENS IN THE ATTIC twenty years ago, I would have recommended it. But now that the bar has been raised for family films, I would say wait for the dvd, and only if you're a parent.
18776	6	a	Ray, don't quit your day job. 
18777	3	a	Combined with Hero, this gives Zhang an amazing one-two stylistic action punch.
18778	4	a	Veronica Mars is a great deal more than a bonus episode, but slightly less than a movie.
18779	0	a	... A brilliant meditation on loneliness and life itself ...
18780	4	a	A healthy reminder that Zac Efron is a national treasure ... in these two 'Neighbors' films.
18781	5	a	Sluggish and strangely unaffecting...an essentially mediocre tearjerker that is nonetheless notable for showcasing yet another striking turn by a superb actress.
18782	5	a	It's not interesting enough to watch, and not dull enough to walk out of. It prompts a mild state of catatonia, and nothing more.
18783	4	a	The very premise of Bounce sounds suspect, so it's a credit to Roos' writing that he largely overcomes his own dubious plotline and fashions a fairly involving love story.
18784	4	a	It's often painful, and not in a good way; it's painful because of the roads it doesn't explore, the shortcuts it takes, and the special pleading it can't stop itself from indulging in.
18785	6	a	Despite some tasty contributions from Lawrence and Zahn, too much of National Security has the bland flavor of microwaved leftovers.
18786	7	a	A moronic action/comedy film.
18787	3	a	Meet the Fockers takes time to generate comic momentum, but the irresistible energy of Hoffman and Streisand soon refreshes the leftover story line from Parents.
18788	2	a	Though we do feel the need of other voices to provide perspective, Tupac: Resurrection is even-handed for a single-point -of-view film.
18789	4	a	Occasionally successful, but not Peter Medak at his best.
18790	4	a	If you're looking for inoffensive material that will occasionally draw a chuckle, Welcome to Mooseport is for you.
18791	4	a	Stating that Fast Five is the best of the Fast and the Furious series is perhaps like claiming that the Big Mac is the best hamburger served at McDonald's: It's not so much a declaration of excellence as an example of damning with faint praise.
18792	6	a	He does good work, but madness does not breed efficiency.
18793	7	a	One of the many problems, other than Damon's lack of emotion, is the fact that there's no suspense.
18794	5	a	Could use some color and imagination 
18795	3	a	Raul Julia and Anjelica Huston are given a lot of one-liners and payoff gags, of course, but what's funny is the stuff that comes in between -- the real affection with which they embrace each other, and the way they delight in their unspeakable lifestyle.
18796	4	a	A kid film with not enough going on.
18797	3	a	It just keeps building on an extremely complicated sitcom plot ... and the gorgeous, charming cast just keeps hitting scene after scene out of the park.
18798	3	a	A riveting sit, due to the filmmaker's incredible storytelling gifts, and the cast, who articulate a dreamy series of toxic encounters with sniper-like precision, tightening Almodovar's noose with exceptional skill.
18799	5	a	At about the two-thirds mark, the film starts to wander off on its own, seemingly without really caring if the audience is following along or not.
18800	9	a	Welcome to Snoozeport. The phrase 'sleepy little town' has a whole new meaning.
18801	3	a	Talk, mood and feel dominate as action fades into the background. The air is filled with the sting of smoke, buttressed by the heavy smell of a dark brew.
18802	7	a	Had the execution been tighter, it would be an easy recommendation, but as is, there's no need to rush off from Thanksgiving leftovers to see it.
18803	6	a	Now, I'm not saying director Tim Story was the wrong choice but when the only two things of note on your resume are the moderately amusing Barbershop and the horrendous Taxi there just has to be a better way to go.
18804	5	a	An undercooked slice of paranormal mumbo jumbo with the genes of an M. Night Shyamalan chin-scratcher but the execution of a diffident nonbeliever. What was Clint thinking?
18805	4	a	While Soul Power is bound to be compared to the Oscar-winning Ali/Foreman documentary When We Were Kings, it never scales the same heights.
18806	9	a	The rest of the movie is a predictable guns 'n' beasts gorefest that wants to be equal parts Aliens, Titanic, and Anaconda but winds up being all parts crap.
18807	4	a	.
18808	5	a	A cartoonish, unfocused and mostly unfunny satire that doesn't come within a hundred miles of hitting its two main targets.
18809	0	a	Burton wraps it all in his singular vision, devoid of bells and whistles and all the more potent for its comparative subtlety.
18810	3	a	There are enough good moments in Ralph Breaks the Internet that you should not delete any ideas of seeing it. Just be ready to hit escape when things turn to the dark web.
18811	3	a	The film gives a fine sense of why Shakur's fans carry the torch for his legacy. But it's better from the perspective of that spirit on the streets, not up in the clouds. 
18812	4	a	A compelling film that could have been a classic with some judicious editing in the end and a rethink of the climax.
18813	4	a	For a brief shining moment, the film is all sunsets, cocktails, and flirtations. Leave it to the plot to ruin everything.
18814	0	a	Still the best film from the Coen brothers.
18815	3	a	Sharp-edged, surreal, and often astonishing in its giddy creativity.
18816	4	a	Artful, intelligent and wilfully obtuse, Cronenberg uses his skill to hold our interest through this oddity of a film.
18817	5	a	Sure, it's fun, after a fashion, to see them all in the same place, kicking and creaking. But that's about all it is.
18818	0	a	It's a sweet, laugh-a-minute crowd pleaser that lifts your spirits as well as the corners of your mouth.
18819	5	a	Disappointing big-screen debut for Picard's gang
18820	3	a	In the end, one can deduce from Berg's documentary that the Catholic Church is driven by money and power, those oft described roots of all evil and corruption.
18821	9	a	The jokes aren't funny, the characters aren't fully developed and poor editing only makes a humorless story confusing.
18822	5	a	Carter gives every sports-drama cliche a chance to play. No bad idea is benched.
18823	4	a	Through it all, the actors play their roles with suspect conviction.
18824	1	a	Haunting, hard- bitten and absurdly involving.
18825	4	a	Sure, it sounds like predictable disco mush, but with Bow Wow in the driver's seat, a hammy cast and a never-ending roster of zingy one-liners, it's harmless fun.
18826	5	a	Those who have seen enough of these films - and who know all their tricks - will likely recognize that Hitch is nothing special.
18827	2	a	They're mostly comedic stories, but two deadly serious segments undercut the levity and give Letters an uneven tone. So do the wild deviations in style, ranging from stark black-and-white domestic drama to psychedelic musical fantasy.
18828	4	a	It has the reeled-in pyrotechnics and the muted pacing of an intelligent spy film, but it doesn't have the smarts of one.
18829	3	a	This boisterous romp lifted my spirits and tickled my funny bone. In these dark days, that's something to cheer about.
18830	3	a	This film probably won't please people who enjoy it when Neil LaBute picks at society's scabs. For those who don't mind their reality undercut with a little bit of fancy and who'd rather have someone kiss it and make it better, Nurse Betty is in.
18831	2	a	Matt Tyrnauer's documentary about the venerable Italian fashion designer, Valentino, has been billed as a love story, and so it is.
18832	2	a	Breezily paced, deftly plotted, confidently played -- this wildly entertaining dramedy about a desk-bound TV news reporter who impulsively accepts a job in war-torn Afghanistan has plenty to recommend it. Top of that list is Tina Fey,
18833	9	a	"The ""retreat"" in the title is surely a warning to any potential ticket buyers."
18834	0	a	The Coens return to form, creating their most idiosyncratic characters since Steve Buscemi's Carl Showalter faced down the wood chipper in Fargo.
18835	5	a	This mushy tale of twenty-something angst is like a Euro version of Reality Bites.
18836	3	a	Trust me, [there's] a scene you need to witness with a crowd that whoops and cheers, which is really what this film demands of its audience throughout.
18837	8	a	Amusing, whimsical, time-traveling cinematic celebration of the iconic City of Lights
18838	4	a	Despite some strong performances and an earnest message, Paper Towns feels too much like a paper movie.
18839	6	a	The sloppy storytelling leaves the magic in short supply.
18840	1	a	...consistently elevated by the superb performances and Sam Mendes' expectedly enthralling directorial choices.
18841	4	a	Bee-boundaries are so last-year and fans are likely to understand it in Seinfeldian-hysterical terms. To the rest of us it's an overstretched been-there, seen-that concept.
18842	6	a	This is the sort of film that only makes sense as a rental - with, perhaps, a couple of friends, and a very generously mixed pitcher of margaritas.
18843	9	a	Plain and simple, The Libertine is Depp's effort to pull a Charlize: defined as a preternaturally gorgeous actor attempting to portray a visibly repulsive person for award-worthy attention.
18844	2	a	Sure the movie's multiple viewpoint contrivance is just an excuse to get to a car chase, but it's a good car chase.
18845	4	a	Aussie filmmaker Ray Lawrence's debt to Robert Altman in his previous Lantana is made explicit in his new film Jindabyne.
18846	4	a	Eastwood can do no wrong in my eyes ... but he came dangerously close with this one.
18847	6	a	This is one of those many movies where there's nothing terribly wrong, and yet it still never feels even remotely right.
18848	4	a	Whether you're ready for the ride depends on whether you're looking for traditional filmic fare, or whether you're in the mood to be dragged into the depths of depression.
18849	3	a	There's only one character that really matters in this sumptuous, romantic ghost story -- the grandiloquent decaying mansion at its center.
18850	3	a	Its best scenes come as the characters are established and get to know one another.
18851	4	a	While it's not always successful at doing so, this film does have its perceptive, thoughtful moments. And it features one of the best ensemble casts in recent memory.
18852	4	a	"It never questions or qualifies its upbeat message, but it's watchable, well-crafted stuff, strongly acted, with a very funny opening ""weigh-in"" sequence, as Vinny desperately tries to sweat off excess pounds with minutes to go."
18853	0	a	Co-directors Wash Westmoreland and Richard Glatzer keep the film simple and straightforward, cutting to the core of the matter without the need to tug at the heartstrings.
18854	5	a	While an appealing combination of travelogue, spiritual improvement story and road movie, Unmistaken Child fails to fully capitalize on its intriguing subjects.
18855	3	a	It's a bold, weirdly charming and violent look at the modern family unit that makes for one of the most thought-provoking cinematic endeavors of this year 
18856	1	a	Hong paints a piercing portrait of impetuous, confused, selfish masculinity in which the thrill of the chase repeatedly proves more enticing than the rewards of triumph.
18857	4	a	A waist-high muck of studio meddling that contains some franchise high-points. Wade through and be rewarded accordingly.
18858	0	a	No other film in history has even attempted such a concentrated interpretation of these unimaginable events let alone do so with what I call such reverential explicitness.
18859	1	a	Like Vardalos and Corbett, who play their roles with vibrant charm, the film, directed by Joel Zwick, is heartfelt and hilarious in ways you can't fake.
18860	9	a	Revels in human ugliness.
18861	5	a	The first-act crash is admittedly spectacular and the ending adequately suspenseful, but what comes between is disappointingly routine and completely lacks the kind character complexity that made the original a thrill every step of the way.
18862	7	a	With two great, ideally cast actors and such potentially fascinating subject matter, why does Love Ranch feel like a clumsy TV movie?
18863	6	a	The whole thing is pretty routine and, at times, downright silly.
18864	2	a	Life may be pre-packaged goodness, but it's served warm by a director comfortably basking in the glow of his preferred genre.
18865	6	a	As the girls' mother, Kristin Scott Thomas is basically reduced to shaking her head, sighing and wondering how things turned out so badly. Indeed.
18866	1	a	There's a vibrant nature to the acting in this film that warms the heart and makes it feel comfortable, even when things aren't going so great for the characters.
18867	3	a	It's so square, so sunny, that it feels blissfully out of step. Think of it as comfort food for these troubling times. 
18868	4	a	Though there is a near vaccuum at the center of the film, Sommersby is never boring, largely because of Ms. Foster's beautifully self-possessed presence.
18869	2	a	...always an interesting filmmaker to watch.
18870	4	a	Even an act of noble sacrifice late in the film has a faintly goofy tone to it, reflective of Shane Black's streak of puckish nihilism, and that attitude makes him a perfect fit for this franchise.
18871	9	a	Instead of birthing a new method of distribution, Netflix demonstrated the most high profile dumping of a garbage product.
18872	9	a	Many actors were paid to pretend Williams is still funny in Man of the Year.
18873	3	a	A feast of fangs bared acting by two exemplars of the form, John Malkovich and Willem Dafoe.
18874	2	a	A strong supporting cast, including Matthew Goode as crypto-analyst Hugh Alexander, Mark Strong as spymaster Stewart Menzies and Charles Dance as head of the codebreaking unit Alastair Denniston, are given tragically little screen time.
18875	0	a	"[VIDEO ESSAY] ""Wild Strawberries"" is a thematically abundant film that fluidly condenses a lifetime's worth of experience into succinct cinematic fragments under Ingmar Bergman's complex construction of abstract corollaries."
18876	1	a	A love affair is inevitable, but Guadagnino doesn't skim over Elio's prolonged longing, which is what makes Call Me by Your Name most potent as a coming-of-age picture, not a mere romance.
18877	6	a	Gory enough to satisfy jaded horror fans and scary enough to offer a decent, frightening night at the movies for everyone else.
18878	2	a	Funny spoof on serial killers.
18879	6	a	Secondhand Lions tries to delight, but its charms are no more credible than the swashbuckling adventure that Caine's character recounts.
18880	9	a	I can't begin to tell you how bland this movie is.
18881	9	a	There is something charming in the way it bravely invites derision, like the boy in the high school play who can't remember his lines and decides to milk an awkward situation for laughs instead.
18882	0	a	McDormand is an unstoppable force in a fiercely intelligent, profanely poetic movie that shifts tonal gears at breakneck speed.
18883	2	a	"The Bourne Supremacy"" is an exciting, finely crafted action thriller with the accent on ""thrill."
18884	2	a	I found the film to be a touching and unique look at human sexuality and interaction.
18885	4	a	It's a clunky title, based on the hit novel by John Bellairs, but it's a satisfying appetizer for those craving a little pre-Halloween treat. 
18886	4	a	...the movie becomes bogged down in underwater adventures towards the end.
18887	8	a	What works for a two-minute sketch can blunder on the big screen. And for this feature-length comedy, it bombs.
18888	5	a	Turturro supplies some good moments, but without a believable emotional core the film falls short
18889	5	a	"Nothing more than an attempt to stroke the ""Star Wars"" fans ... they're probably the only ones who might appreciate what is generally a weak and unfunny movie."
18890	6	a	Balancing the darkly comic with the tragically lurid is a tough trick; on a good day Jim Thompson could get the balance right, but Sehr simply seems to be cross-cutting between two entirely different movies.
18891	1	a	The movie is gross and smutty: It is having so much fun portraying terrible people doing terrible things to one another that it has no interest in pausing to think about what any of this means. Thankfully.
18892	9	a	Without major tension, conflict or crisis, Brawne and Keats simply mope about, moon at each other, talk about literature and wait for the great poet to die from tuberculosis.
18893	4	a	One Stiller movie I actually enjoyed.
18894	3	a	A romantic comedy is only as irresistible as are its temporarily star-crossed lovers. By this barometer, the enjoyably breezy Must Love Dogs boasts quite a pedigree.
18895	5	a	Distressingly locates evil in ethnicity: A scene in which the wife marvels at the lovely 'whiteness' of her nude husband sleeping among snowy sheets seems more troubling than cute after the couple falls victim to dusky satanists in the Dominican Republic.
18896	6	a	...less a noble failure than a very minor miracle.
18897	4	a	A visually chilly but often very funny satire of American greed and conspicuous consumption.
18898	9	a	Field does a good job of making Doris feel like a person, and manages to finish with grace even as all around her crumbles and stumbles.
18899	9	a	Tim Story gives the Marvel comics superheroes the Barbershop treatment.
18900	5	a	You don't expect realism from a comic-book movie, but you do want the characters to seem larger than life. Here, they look like contestants at a costume party.
18901	4	a	Here's a film that looks good, has production values to die for and an all-star cast who mostly make their mark.
18902	1	a	Jennifer Aniston removes her Hollywood glamour to convincingly play a drab Texas cashier teetering on the edge of depression. It's one of the best performances of the year.
18903	4	a	While the movie comes on like a crowd pleaser, it leaves a highly acrid taste.
18904	4	a	"Money Train"" is a by-the-numbers action-buddy picture, and few directors run through those numbers as smoothly as Joseph Ruben."
18905	5	a	I urge you to say the director's name aloud. Florian Henckel von Donnersmarck. Did you do it? There, you just had more fun than you would if you watched The Tourist. 
18906	5	a	Stallone, never a clear speaker, spends most of his time grunting like a Gloucester Old Spot or barking like a sea lion with a sore throat.
18907	3	a	The movie's real star is the Sharpes' decaying mansion... a chilling living presence in its own right.
18908	3	a	Bolt's nothing short of a winning mix of pixel perfect magic.
18909	1	a	Ridley Scott has assembled the ingredients in this movie like a perfectly iced martini that is stirred, not shaken. The result is dry but refreshing -- and with a kick.
18910	3	a	The movie ... speaks to another, more precious kind of privilege, one that straight kids have had since movies began: the right to a romantic fantasy served up like ice cream, tart and sweet.
18911	5	a	Though it earns the odd chuckle on occasions, it's essentially just an elongated and largely pointless spoof movie designed only to glorify Smith's own hermetic movie-world.
18912	5	a	As much as I can recognize the obvious effort and specific intent that went into the film, I am at a complete loss to comprehend what exactly it's trying to say to me.
18913	3	a	But the timeless torture of trying to decipher if his feelings are reciprocated, what to do about it if they are, and how each of them should feel about it, is rendered with poignant delicacy. 
18914	6	a	Don't get me wrong, it's not horrific, it's just pointless, and no matter which angle you choose to watch it from the only thing you get while viewing Vantage Point is the unceasing desire to turn your eyes someplace else.
18915	5	a	"Billy Lynn's Long Halftime Walk"" goes nowhere."
18916	4	a	McCarthy is a worthy successor to John Candy, who also had a gift for warming up caricatures with loveable humanity.
18917	5	a	As more and more films use this conceit, the premise of someone filming at all salient moments becomes more and more strained, until the device itself becomes not just derivative, but positively cumbersome.
18918	4	a	For a great deal of its running time it is raw, uncompromising and very, very funny, and even when things hit a dry spell I was still moved and amused enough to not particularly care.
18919	3	a	Sometimes the most dated parts of an old film can be the most enjoyable; so it is with Bond's fifth movie, Thunderball.
18920	3	a	While this family film often follows the traditional mechanics of its genre, the emotions it elicits feel far from manufactured.
18921	4	a	In addition to a clever plot, intrigue, and a car chase or two, Matt Damon manages to pull off being a friendly face that happens to be a highly-trained killer.
18922	10	a	"A ghastly rip-off of the John Hughes genre, ""Unaccompanied Minors"" is so awful that it should be accompanied by a warning: May insult your intelligence. Proceed at your own risk."
18923	5	a	Flightplan should have remained grounded for repairs.
18924	3	a	As the movie wraps - and it really does feel like it's a tidy wrap up and a goodbye to them - you might even realize how much you'll miss them in the future.
18925	1	a	A dazzling piece of entertainment -- a mystery so cleverly constructed you find yourself wanting to see it again before it's over.
18926	5	a	For all Wonderland's kinetic energy, the mind wanders.
18927	10	a	The worst of the Coens' genre-ransacking; mean and self-congratulatory.
18928	6	a	The most controversial film of the summer is both disturbing and exhilarating in its evocative rendering of a smackhead's chaotic universe.
18929	7	a	Vice lacks that human touch, those insights into the men away from their beats... Mannequin Vice might have made for a better title.
18930	3	a	We know Dave Grohl is a great drummer and an incredible frontman; now we know he's a great documentary filmmaker too...
18931	2	a	The Wedding Banquet wins fans with its sunny disposition as it turns a contemporary story about a marriage of convenience into a deft bedroom farce and humanist drama.
18932	1	a	Elegant, understated epic takes its time going backward with forward-thinking director at the helm.
18933	6	a	A paint-by-number action comedy that yields far more laughs than it should.
18934	6	a	It sends you home reeling, but wondering what the point of it was, and why so many worthwhile people bothered to do it in the first place.
18935	6	a	Is this Roman's advice to student filmmakers with less family playdoh to not let life pass them by?
18936	6	a	The film feels more like a thesis than vivid drama.
18937	3	a	This is an unpleasant and uncomfortable horror film to sit through, be warned. It improves a great deal on thinking about it afterward.
18938	4	a	Indescribably gorgeous... You don't have to watch it, but you gotta see it.
18939	3	a	Marsh's sensitive doc is a light look at some dark clues to the kind of creatures we really are.
18940	4	a	Its most perverse twist on the undercover genre is this: It finds sympathy for one of the devils.
18941	0	a	One of the very few films that truly, terribly horrifies. A classic.
18942	1	a	[A] well paced, entertaining and thought-provoking piece of science fiction cinema, a truly superb, yet disregarded gem of that particular genre.
18943	3	a	Bloody sword-and-sandals epic is good, but not great.
18944	4	a	An urban fantasy, with florid observations about life and love...Sometimes, competent direction and a brace of star power are enough.
18945	5	a	The French cuisine the camera ogles in 'Paris Can Wait' looks succulent, but the movie itself is a bland dish.
18946	4	a	Shot and edited so clumsily that pivotal moments of action are obscured.
18947	4	a	An engaging new direction for Eli Roth, who offsets the odd tonal hiccup with plenty of ghoulish delights.
18948	6	a	...while I didn't mind the overabundance of humor and the ultra violent streak of the kills, it's far too clunky to fully recommend.
18949	6	a	Adding to the narrative tedium are the often laughably amateurish turns by the justly unknown cast.
18950	0	a	An ambitious and self serving group bent on their own self survival make for a crisp script. Lancaster at his larger than life best... A classic.
18951	0	a	I was exhilarated--and devastated.
18952	0	a	Classic action set pieces, Harrison Ford at his swashbuckling best, Old Testament spirituality, and a satiric jab at Nazi anti-Semitism.
18953	6	a	While some might mistake it as a bitter view of sexual politics and empowerment, it's also pretty crass filmmaking.
18954	3	a	A film that really earns it's epic title and the lush Elvis Costello ballad over the final credits. 
18955	4	a	... a gentle and astute minor comedy of manners
18956	4	a	A groundbreaking performance by Kevin Bacon
18957	8	a	While the violence is solid, the ludicrous science expositions that carry the plot along and unfortunate flat humor had me confused. Is this the Predator film or a joke? 
18958	3	a	It's Turing himself, of course, who is the story's biggest enigma, and Cumberbatch's performance unlocks his secrets with spellbinding brilliance. 
18959	2	a	Any dramatic film can go wrong if it doesn't completely ring true, and Marvin's Room misses the mark.
18960	4	a	The film's ridiculously contrived main conflict plays out with all the drama and interest of the Utah primary.
18961	9	a	The main problem of Land of the Dead is that it's lame.
18962	4	a	Crafting his meditation on the men who answer the call of the wild, Sean Penn's adaptation is heavy on mood and ambiance but sadly lacking in depth, giving up on the wider comparisons to focus fully on McCandless, who may not be up to the scrutiny.
18963	3	a	There's more visual wit in Gore Verbinski's Rango than the last two Pixar films combined.
18964	0	a	"Another Woody Allen's ""Amarcord"" - warm, rueful, poignant and hilarious."
18965	5	a	Once the gimmick has worn out its welcome, the movie makes misstep after misstep until a final shootout of baffling stupidity.
18966	0	a	Every line of dialogue, indeed every small action, is packed with meaning in this taxingly potent film.
18967	3	a	Bond is back, and so is high-octane entertainment.
18968	2	a	Cruz is creased and bent by the pressures the movie's hectic plot pounds her with. She is never less than 'perfect', but she also deeply human and no longer impossible... and that's movie magic.
18969	3	a	The themes may soar but everything else -- the dialogue, the performances, the direction, the dancing itself -- is credibly grounded. That makes for a very pleasing contrast. Not many movies bring their uplift down to earth.
18970	8	a	Even I could play against these guys and maybe win. 
18971	6	a	...mostly just dull and forgettable.
18972	6	a	"Against the Ropes"" has slim, sizzling Meg Ryan in its corner... but the film is a loosely-patched version of about twelve other movies."
18973	3	a	The film features some of the most astounding computer animation ever, and, thanks to a slew of terrific voice actors who are obviously having a great time, the film is wildly, weirdly amusing.
18974	3	a	A playful, meandering, somewhat confusing tale that hangs together as a portrait of demented love.
18975	3	a	It really does get better - at the movies anyway.
18976	4	a	Scruffy and twisty, this honeymoon-from-hell thriller kind of unravels as it goes along. But before it succumbs to the formula, the actors manage to catch our attention, so we have to see it through to what'll surely be an outrageous finale.
18977	4	a	A totally enchanting costume drama about Jane Austen's yearning for love and a place in the literary world dominated by men.
18978	5	a	Short on laughs despite being an easy concept for witty writers, the film flaunts an over-extended running time and lame dialogue.
18979	1	a	The movie does an uncanny job of re-creating the visual feel of Murnau's film.
18980	3	a	Part slow-burn mother-daughter drama, part slow-burn suspense thriller, and part slow-burn romance, with a few twists for good measure as the town begins to come apart at the seams.
18981	1	a	Humorous, romantic, personal.
18982	5	a	I guess I was expecting too much of the old television show in this movie, and it didn't deliver any of that. They didn't even use the theme song, for crying out loud.
18983	1	a	In an age when the concept of comedies about possible kinships between characters is dominated by sugary devices and contrivance, here at last is a movie about real situations, real people and the natural experiences that evolve from them.
18984	4	a	You won't actually learn much about Alfred Hitchcock from Sacha Gervasi's briskly superficial biopic. But you'll enjoy the experience anyway.
18985	3	a	A smart thriller for a smart audience.
18986	10	a	You'd have to be more than merely intoxicated to find anything about this dismal stoner comedy remotely funny. You'd have to be unconscious.
18987	0	a	David O Russell's film fizzes with energy and wit, bowling along with a brio that matches the quick-wit and razzle-dazzle of its con artists.
18988	4	a	What's so striking about Jolie's performance is that she never lets her character become a caricature -- not even with that radioactive hair.
18989	8	a	Snow Dogs finds its humour in a black man getting humiliated by a pack of dogs who are smarter than him
18990	4	a	Anyone with a fondness for the midcentury cartoons and films that inspired this scrappy comedy will appreciate the latest trip to the titular British boarding school.
18991	9	a	A derivative collection of horror and sci-fi cliches.
18992	4	a	Perhaps director Thor Freudenthal might have made a somewhat more satisfying film if he'd assumed the viewers were grown up as well.
18993	3	a	[A] small, beautifully faceted gem.
18994	2	a	With equal measures of raunch and sentimentality, Knocked Up explores the minefield of imminent parenthood for two people who don't know each other very well.
18995	3	a	...comedy comfort food.
18996	6	a	One of those annoying movies that has enough good stuff in it that it can't be dismissed out-of-hand, but enough deficits that one is hard-pressed to praise it. 
18997	3	a	Following L.A. Confidential and Wonder Boys, this makes a remarkable hat-trick for Hanson and is a personal triumph for Eminem.
18998	5	a	Its sheer shameless juvenilia ranges from horribly unfunny to outrageously zany.
18999	1	a	As the rich drama plays out, Reign of Fire proves to be a thoroughly taut, well-considered fable.
19000	5	a	It's a prefab slapstick-'n'-pathos stew that doesn't taste like anything.
19001	5	a	The pool sharks in The Hustler have it all over the card sharks in The Cincinnati Kid, in spades.
19002	3	a	As much as you can point to the T-rex attack as a master class in action filmmaking, this still leaves a mechanized aftertaste.
19003	6	a	The story idea is an interesting one, but it doesn't quite pan out in the end. There are too many unanswered questions and unresolved conflicts.
19004	3	a	The film, which admittedly stumbles in the home stretch and just misses out on something like greatness, is nonetheless a visual and metaphysical delight. Come hungry, come searching, come lonely.
19005	4	a	The comedy is hit and miss, with just enough hits to make it worth watching once.
19006	3	a	An uneven but sweet movie about growing up and growing older.
19007	0	a	I'm now officially scared of being alone in the same room with a television.
19008	3	a	The new film has much in common with some of Herzog's crazed past masterworks like Aguirre, the Wrath of God.
19009	9	a	The scenes between Depp and Morton throw off sparks, but the movie as a whole needs focus, oomph.
19010	3	a	For a movie so sensuously mounted, it's remarkably grounded.
19011	4	a	moderately engaging and fascinating, but without enough insightful and more provocative interviews, it merely scratches the surface of Tibetan reincarnation rather than delving profoundly into it.
19012	6	a	It's the kind of roller-coaster Hollywood churns out seemingly in its sleep, oversaturated with effects shots and plot implausibilities. Ten minutes after you've seen it, you'll have forgotten all about it.
19013	3	a	Has a few almost first-rate pleasures.
19014	0	a	an engaging and soulful masterpiece about a kindergarten teacher in a small French mining town.
19015	5	a	"The stolid inertia of this story is so joyless that the film's sole ""passionate"" element is the desire to garner Oscar consideration for Close's performance."
19016	3	a	His symbol is the eagle. He beats up on little Frenchmen. He is 'the only one of my kind,' the world's lone and lonely superpower. Hancock is a clever metaphor for America in the world.
19017	1	a	A beautiful, grim tale.
19018	6	a	Alpha Dog isn't a total wash, but it is unfocused, overstuffed and routine.
19019	2	a	Feel good and forget about it, that seems to be the goal of Larry Crowne, and it's something this Tom Hanks directed film accomplishes with flourish.
19020	9	a	Wilson tries far too hard. Dillon is miserable as the square butt of dumb gags. And just six years after Almost Famous, isn't Hudson still a tad young to play the solid, judgingly mature mommy-wife who talks of 'prioritizing responsibilities?'
19021	2	a	Hitchcock is most engaging when concentrating on the nitty gritty of Psycho's development, as opposed to the potboiler subplot involving his wife that leaves very little at stake.
19022	3	a	One of the reasons why Different for Girls works is because of the caliber of acting.
19023	4	a	"As Good As It Gets"" is decent, if not vintage, James L. Brooks, made all the more palatable by that man Jack Nicholson."
19024	2	a	...every sports movie cliche, combined it with a relatively revealing look at the early days of the Nelson Mandela administration...
19025	3	a	A Waiting for Godot for art-house movie buffs.
19026	1	a	"Here's a movie for adults that's warm and enjoyable, but has brains and ambition. Tom Hanks directs with a soft touch but not a soft head. ""Larry Crowne"" is like fancy French toast - comfort food with a dollop of aspiration."
19027	4	a	You'll forget the whole picture the minute you leave the theatre, but for the two hours you're sitting there in the dark, it's mildly, and pleasantly engaging.
19028	2	a	Men of a certain size will love Paul Blart - and his pursuit through the centre is remarkably inventive. Truly for all the family.
19029	0	a	McDonagh has written a clever, gripping story brilliantly performed by McDormand whose expressive eyes show every thought and capture the depths of her pain.
19030	0	a	One of the greatest love stories of all time. Ford's direction is brilliant; O'Hara is beautiful; the cinematography is dazzling, and the brawl between Wayne and McLaglan at the finale is a comic treasure. A must-see.
19031	8	a	Tantalizing, touching and timeless - an epic fable revolving around mortality.
19032	6	a	Doom isn't doomed, but the movie doesn't let loose and really rock until its final third.
19033	4	a	It's hard to imagine a better futuristic flying dragon movie than this, if one can imagine such a thing at all. However, while we wait for such a comparison, we could probably do a lot worse than Reign Of Fire.
19034	10	a	The humour thrives primarily off of the kookiness of its characters.
19035	4	a	Seth MacFarlane scales back on some of the crassness and plays up the charm in his latest feature film. The result is fitfully funny, a bit trifling, and paradoxically inoffensive.
19036	6	a	"With a weak finish that doesn't exactly live up to the suggested satanic baby mama drama, Devil's Due will leave hardcore genre fans yearning for much more ""bite,"" as even the ""bark"" is a tad bit weak."
19037	5	a	Give this to Paul Blart: Mall Cop: It delivers on everything it promises. Which is to say, nearly nothing.
19038	7	a	The sequel suffers from a lame, saccharine premise and a fatally earnest manner.
19039	1	a	The football scenes are brutally real; the locker room scenes are totally authentic.
19040	4	a	Soderbergh raises clumsy and absurd moments to keep the mood, wrapped in country-style musical atmospheres like John Denver and Creedence Clearwater Revival. [Full review in Spanish]
19041	4	a	Animaniacs will probably want to bump that rating up a star, and even I am looking forward to catching episodes of the TV show.
19042	5	a	Tries to win our hearts without doing much for our brains or our funny bones, and it just doesn't work.
19043	3	a	A literate, lyrical love story in the age of Hollywood crass. I must be dreaming.
19044	2	a	If at first [Hoffman's] German accent seems unnatural, trust in the actor, whose low guttural enunciation exhibits an ear finely tuned to the idiosyncrasies of the language.
19045	4	a	If y'all like your comedy with a Lone Star drawl and as black as Texas tea, then by all means tuck right into Killer Joe.
19046	3	a	There are all kinds of love relationships in this world, and perhaps they all deserve a romantic comedy this unflinching and this sensitive.
19047	3	a	Some movies are so likable, so naturally charming, that you'll forgive any dopey idea they throw at you.
19048	3	a	Stunningly animated, if somewhat derivative, story of an ordinary, extraordinary family.
19049	5	a	"Cate Blanchett's is so broad and unsubtle that ""Carol"" feels like a ""Carol Burnett Show"" parody."
19050	4	a	A certain casualty of the ever-changing vision for this movie, is the lack of a palpable tone and identity, but thankfully there's a certain allure that ensures the viewer remains engaged.
19051	6	a	Once again, director Chris Columbus takes a hat-in-hand approach to Rowling that stifles creativity and allows the film to drag on for nearly three hours.
19052	4	a	There's no denying Gibson's passion in bringing his vision to the screen, no matter how dodgy his religious beliefs.
19053	5	a	Largely avoids the gimmicky saccharine aftertaste that's typical of the genre. Anyone older than the story's resident Job, however, may not find much to write home about.
19054	4	a	As lightweight as a salad and about as filling, this is amiable but predictable.
19055	4	a	Has a surprising amount of heart, but heart doesn't replace good gags.
19056	3	a	A carnival of a film with cons, cleavage and the great Christian Bale.
19057	2	a	The details aren't always compelling enough to compensate for the movie's slow pace, but they build to a satisfyingly bleak conclusion. 
19058	2	a	In the end, an elevating and in many ways, exceptional experience.
19059	5	a	This pretty routine followup has some decent material and amiable bad taste, heavily diluted with gallons of very ordinary sequel product: more of the same.
19060	4	a	"The fight scenes, filmed in what I'll call ""Kato-Vision,"" are top shelf and rival anything you'd find in the ""Matrix"" world."
19061	9	a	You, Me and Dupree is lazy, obvious, never emotionally real and, most unfortunately, sporadically funny at best. It's a movie you've seen before and you've seen done better. Owen, it's time to grow up.
19062	3	a	"Unlike time travel or jet-setting, ""Safety Not Guaranteed"" shows that making movies can still be more about the journey than the destination. Whether or not you have first-class tickets."
19063	5	a	With plenty of girl-on-girl action, this is the movie that photographer David Hamilton would love to make.
19064	3	a	[Parker and Stone] aren't always as evenhanded with their satirical barbs as they profess to be.
19065	3	a	The format brilliantly brings an audience that much closer to a handful of increasingly lonely, yet contagiously enthusiastic, animals.
19066	2	a	To enjoy this movie, you just have to accept that fact that it doesn't always make sense. The moments of fun outweigh the times when they're trying too hard to be clever.
19067	5	a	An endless and endlessly pretentious expansion of the popular Japanese anime TV series.
19068	1	a	The film is a great ode to the power of falling in love and discovering one's own truth and identity through the reflection of another.
19069	2	a	The frenetic pace plays in favor of the film... moving from one action sequence to another with small breaks for the required dose of plot that is needed only to generate some empathy with the protagonists. [Full review in Spanish]
19070	4	a	My favorite moment involves a Jar-Jar Binks tattoo -- and whether or not that idea strikes you as funny should be a pretty good indicator of whether or not you'll like Fanboys.
19071	0	a	Captures the sadness and exhilaration of life and puts both side by side in a way that is undeniably moving
19072	7	a	I would have had much more interest in this film if the cinematographer would have just handed the camera over to Vanessa Hudgens and turned her loose alone in her hotel room.
19073	0	a	Powerful, haunting, and at times very moving.
19074	3	a	A smart, stylish horror picture that offers a fresh twist on the ever-reliable revenge theme and affords a raft of talented young actors solid roles that show them to advantage.
19075	5	a	It took nine people to write the cheap-looking animated film Rock Dog, and not one of them ever stopped to consider the fact that the dog of the title never rocks.
19076	0	a	Dares us to reconcile our spiritual and physical selves.
19077	0	a	This 'special edition' of Amadeus proves that Abraham's Oscar triumph was no fluke.
19078	1	a	a deeply atmospheric murder mystery in which we wonder less about who committed the crime and more about who will ultimately pay for it.
19079	4	a	Fact is, The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford should have been better. It should have followed the real focus on the story and done away with at least an hour of subplotting.
19080	6	a	Life's too short to waste your time on this, even if the end isn't near.
19081	6	a	Either Preston is really good at martial arts, or everyone else is really bad. Probably a little of both.
19082	5	a	The solitary Ghost Dog remains too remote a figure to sustain much interest, and certain elements of the film do not fit well together.
19083	0	a	A progressively engrossing horror effort...
19084	9	a	Despite the comedy's reliance on drug humor, first-time director Jesse Dylan is actually less interested in getting high than in seeing how low he can go.
19085	4	a	One of those movies that works better on a second viewing; it's a gentle, loosely structured tale of lost souls that'll wash away if you let it.
19086	2	a	Whereas The Descendants' paradisal locale hid uncomfortable truths, the bleak depiction of the economically-depressed Midwest belies the sweet, sturdy father/son story at Nebraska's heart. 
19087	3	a	The supporting cast are excellent, particularly rising British star Rebecca Hall as Borden's wife and David Bowie,looking disturbingly like Ricky Gervais in a bizarre turn as mysterious scientist Nikolai Tesla.
19088	3	a	Ernest performances from its actors, with an ability to unfold an historical turning point in a very entertaining, dramatic way.
19089	0	a	Most remarkable is the way the entire film seems so effortless, carrying us off on an adventure we never want to end. 
19090	4	a	Hollywood has become strangely squeamish about sex. That's never been a problem for Pedro Almodovar, who reminds us early on in Broken Embraces why his movies have become a refuge for grown-ups seeking sexual candor.
19091	3	a	The Other Boleyn Girl is an agreeable piece of filmmaking, carefully and sometimes artfully balancing solemnity with fluff.
19092	2	a	"It may be, as Thoreau said, that ""most men lead lives of quiet desperation,"" but in the movies, desperation is much more likely to be loud."
19093	9	a	Sex and violence cheapie is pain in the plunging neckline.
19094	6	a	[Clint] Eastwood, a capable and competent filmmaker, seems to have trusted the script and his non-actors more than his instincts.
19095	10	a	Someone ought to pay for this.
19096	4	a	A smart script and great casting elevate a pedestrian premise to the status of satisfying thriller.
19097	1	a	Anyone who has experienced the flush of first love will relate, but the fact that the film is specific and detailed both emotionally and physically in its portrayal of a gay relationship makes it a standout.
19098	2	a	A solid fight flick in the vein of THE FIGHTER.
19099	6	a	... As the credits roll at the close of Into the Wild, you don't feel like you've celebrated a life spent on the road less traveled; you feel like you've just witnessed a slow-motion suicide.
19100	4	a	Romero's real forte is gore, and here he delivers.
19101	5	a	If writer/director Craig Brewer were a member of the X-Men, he would be called 'FirstActo,' and his mutant power would be creating dynamic openings to movies. His enemy would be consistency.
19102	7	a	The stars are pleasant but unexciting, the goofy ensemble has a few moments of hilarity but never catches fire, the laughs are very scattered and the film's title is a self-fulfilling prophecy.
19103	8	a	"The phrase ""worse than Super Mario Brothers"" should not be tossed around lightly when it comes to feature film adaptations of popular video games"
19104	6	a	No matter how purely sung, the music keeps getting lost in the melodrama.
19105	3	a	Love, Simon is sweet, funny and immensely likeable and should persuade even the hardest heart that everyone deserves a great love story.
19106	0	a	The Daniel Craig era comes of age with a ballsy Bond that takes brave chances and bold risks. Guess what? Turns out you can teach an old dog new tricks.
19107	0	a	No less than a gushing ode to cinema itself. Unconditional bliss.
19108	6	a	I prefer my movies to be more entertainment than ordeal.
19109	3	a	A low-concept film about time travel mightn't sound like much of a trip, but first-time director Colin Trevorrow offers good-natured fun and real substance in place of shiny surfaces and whizz-bang effects.
19110	3	a	... delivers what it sets out to do even if the marketing failed to make that clear... works as long as you keep one idea in mind: humans make wild assumptions when it comes to their actual importance in anything.
19111	6	a	Wayne Brady, even at his most intimidating, is about as threatening as a basket full of kittens.
19112	3	a	No party is as joyous as a Muppet celebration, so don't wait until there's only one more sleep till Christmas - enjoy The Muppet Christmas Carol at every chance you get.
19113	1	a	Still Alice is filled with outstanding performances and there are moments as gut-wrenching and harrowing as anything I've seen.
19114	3	a	As entertaining as it is wholesome.
19115	4	a	You half expect them to wheel George Kennedy out for a cameo.
19116	2	a	A fast, funny, deliriously silly, breezy piece of animated folly - far too low-brow for Pixar, far too dragon-free for Dreamworks....A phone app turned into a fun family film? Makes you glad you lived this long.
19117	3	a	'The World's End' is really about the dangers of nostalgia and how you can never truly go home again, even if there hasn't been an alien invasion.
19118	5	a	Cheesy B movies tend to be more fun when they aren't so keenly aware of their cheesy B-movie status.
19119	0	a	Clockers is messy and didactic, but it's complex in a way that a tidy film can't be.
19120	0	a	Almost as fantastic as the original.
19121	2	a	The film is well paced and, even if you're familiar with the story, holds enough surprises to keep your attention and helps begin the upcoming film awards season. 
19122	6	a	The Break-Up goes badly wrong. Although possessed of a laudable desire not to be yet another run-of-the-mill, wacky-impediment -- damned if the picture can figure out how to be an anti-romance comedy.
19123	4	a	Still, this infectious high-in-the-sky thriller radiates with an exploitative off-the-cuff sly wink that's both calculating and campy.
19124	4	a	Charming and harmless. Nap while your kid enjoys.
19125	4	a	The movie is sloppy and not very good, but certain aspects have stubbornly stuck: what it gets right, it gets right, and all credit where it's due.
19126	4	a	Not as good as the original, but still pretty fun, it serves up more of the same and continued to be fresh enough before its many other sequels got too silly.
19127	4	a	Mars-based action epic has strong fantasy violence.
19128	4	a	Kevin Smith fans will enjoy. Not for kids.
19129	5	a	Its constituent parts are great, but just don't come together to make a coherent and satisfying movie.
19130	0	a	... a modern western starring a woman. [Full review in Spanish]
19131	4	a	Has its pluses.
19132	3	a	As character studies of Jack and Claire, it is daring and inventive, and worthy of comparison with the films of a French master of criminal psychology like Jean-Pierre Melville.
19133	5	a	It's all a bit of a slog and, in the end, you don't know much more than you did at the start.
19134	8	a	Stars Anna Faris and Craig Bierko display great comic timing, which is sad considering how little they have to work with.
19135	4	a	There isn't a moment with this group you don't want to be watching, yet the dialogue floats by in wisps.
19136	10	a	Deserving of immediate X-cision and X-termination, and its makers forced to to perform some act of X-piation for it.
19137	1	a	These big, dark gaps in the film, like the darkness around that small lantern's glow, invite us to project our worst fears into them.
19138	4	a	The film is lifted by one of the few actresses out there who can make even the blankest of despair feel entirely fresh.
19139	6	a	It's a sad, haunting story -- but George Hickenlooper's Factory Girl does little to show us why we should care.
19140	3	a	A thoroughly sweet and charming movie, and a reminder of Dern's quality as an actor.
19141	5	a	Mom and Dad Save the World is too calculating and self-serving by far, striving with a manic intensity for its own cult status. Lost on the filmmakers, unfortunately, is the fact that cult movies always possess a dark, disturbing subtext. 
19142	5	a	The film shares far too many tropes with other YA sci-fi properties - The Hunger Games, The Maze Runner, Divergent - to make a mark in the unforgiving post-apocalyptic wasteland of the adolescent market.
19143	4	a	I was disappointed this wasn't as captivating as the book. I was blown away by the trailer, but the movie doesn't live up to that dramatic promise.
19144	3	a	In today's climate, it's a fascinating motion picture, and its diverse-yet-interrelated subject matter can provide fodder for lengthy post-movie discussions.
19145	3	a	The Artist is not at its core a cinematic essay piece or simply an indulgent slice of self-reflexism but an intoxicating story told with skill and humour.
19146	3	a	Meet the Parents doesn't sparkle like Vincente Minnelli's Father of the Bride. But with bubbly adult comedies at such a premium, it goes down like a flute of Champagne, leaving an aftertaste of giggles.
19147	5	a	"Indeed, Bee Moive is full of half-thought-through notions. Much is at first made of Barry's ""romance"" with a human, voiced by Renee Zellweger, but any potential problems in the friendship are dropped without discussion midway through."
19148	3	a	Yet ultimately it's so good, and the attention to truthfulness so intense, that Schrader writes himself into a narrative dead end and to a conclusion that bounces, within a few short minutes, from shocking to preposterous to silly to schmaltzy.
19149	3	a	Even if rap isn't your thing, Tupac's is an intriguing life story -- and nobody tells it better than him.
19150	9	a	American Dreamz is as forgettable and lacking in insight as the great majority of dreams that trespass on our subconscious.
19151	6	a	If there's anything worse than a film that's just plain awful, it's one that should be good but doesn't turn out that way.
19152	0	a	Like a Cheesecake Blizzard: It's a pulpy mess loaded with empty calories, but it's so divine that once you start, you can't help but shovel it into your mouth until the last drop, brain freeze and diet be damned.
19153	6	a	There is some fun in watching the veterans mix it up -- De Niro, who looks like he wants to fade into the scenery, Streisand, who tries to eat it -- but nothing is well developed here.
19154	3	a	Vastly entertaining and in moments even magical, Radio Days is a warmly nostalgic but decidedly unsentimental portrait of Wood Allen's childhood in WWII, when radio was the primary medium of communication.
19155	2	a	Smarter than it is funny with delicious design.
19156	7	a	Ridiculously overwrought.
19157	6	a	It's second not only in sequence, but a distant also-ran in quality, too.
19158	2	a	The comedic edge to the story works well, though at times the film seems too arty.
19159	9	a	not only ridiculously lame but sickeningly contrived
19160	6	a	Bleed For This stays close to the underdog formula, but with very little substance or emotional depth.
19161	0	a	Ambrose Bierce and Clive Barker decided to collaborate? Who knew?
19162	6	a	A jumbled hodgepodge with an excess of plot masquerading as hip thriller.
19163	2	a	Just like the cardboard books we read in kindergarten: short, sweet and easy to sit through.
19164	4	a	More often than not, Theron gives us a caricature rather than a character. As a result, Monster is a well-made movie without much purpose.
19165	1	a	What makes the film special -- and gives it an eerie punch -- is Cameron's computer-generated effect of periodically superimposing images on various positions of the wreck.
19166	2	a	One of Payne's better films.
19167	8	a	Again and again, Angry Birds returns to the well, assuming that imitating the way other cartoons look, or making a goofy noise, will cause something funny to just kind of happen.
19168	2	a	Ridiculous, but also plenty of fun
19169	0	a	For hours and days after you've seen it, you'll still be putting it together in your head. While all of it is gripping, it doesn't come together until the final scene, which is jolting, transcendent, unexpected yet inevitable.
19170	6	a	It passes for an average Stallone film, which doesn't quite make it a good pic even though it's not exactly a bad pic.
19171	5	a	Devoid of much fun, and therefore pointless.
19172	1	a	...a witty, bleak and affectionate riff on the gumshoe genre.
19173	3	a	The acting is wonderful, with Annette Bening outstanding as the vain, deluded and not always likeable actress, and Bell at last finding a period and part that really suit him as an adult actor.
19174	1	a	Godard frames and edits his shots, moves the camera, uses music, and deploys his actors in ways that still seem radical -- even as several generations of directors since have cribbed and stolen from him.
19175	2	a	Oddly daring and realistic.
19176	6	a	It has a lot going for it, but it never quite comes together into a satisfying whole.
19177	6	a	Fitfully amusing but chaotically edited, visually ugly and ultimately quite charmless, The Predator is a crushing, troubling disappointment for fans of both the series and Shane Black.
19178	0	a	Sometimes a scene is a set up for a future plot twist, and sometimes Werner Herzog just wants to film some alligators. Who knows what'll happen? It's like filling your underpants with salamanders.
19179	5	a	Too long, filled with gorgeous costumes, posing models and lots of smoke, this biopic of Yves Saint Laurent is flamboyant, but tedious.
19180	1	a	A tour de force for Cooper.
19181	6	a	Almost torture to sit through its one hundred minutes of banal chatter and counterfeit crises.
19182	0	a	It's not the story so much that is striking as Haynes' re-creation of the era. And it is not just in costumes and sets; it's the way he uses his camera to capture knowing glances, furtive looks, gestures and silences that speak volumes.
19183	3	a	An easygoing portrait of a small Southern town and its eccentric inhabitants.
19184	2	a	Nadine throws a great pity party and it's a credit to Craig's writing and Steinfeld's performance that her unlikeable moments only add to what is a comically complex portrait.
19185	5	a	Silly, sluggish comedy that's destined to be discarded.
19186	8	a	In the tradition of recent Hollywood sequels, this one replays the old gags, gooses up the pace and lowers the level of the humor -- way lower.
19187	2	a	This is not the best by Woody Allen but it sure is clever and entertaining and Paris looks great.
19188	2	a	There are a lot of funny pop culture references and internet references to go along with the film's central message about the nature of friendship. The story is heartwarming, funny and cleverly constructed.
19189	9	a	"The film intends to explore the nature and mystery of death, but devolves into a combination of trivial science fiction and banal ""Pet Sematary"" havoc."
19190	0	a	You stop cringing and start smiling, laughing even, and these kids, who seem like aliens at first, grow on you. They're weirdly likable.
19191	3	a	Rock-and-roll tale of temptation in paradise looks great ... and works thanks to McDormand's fearless performance.
19192	3	a	A surprisingly well-crafted coming-of-age story that will have viewers who grew up without a dog realizing what they missed.
19193	2	a	It was a well-acted, likable and benignly amusing film.
19194	6	a	From Dusk Till Dawn was probably spawned from an all night bender during which Tarantino and Rodriguez thought it would be fun to see if they could make a deliberately lame movie with someone else's money.
19195	9	a	Starts badly and just gets worse.
19196	3	a	For what problems it does have it is a genuinely different take on this kind of material with a firm focus on action, character and humor. No one else should ever attempt to make a superhero movie quite like this, but for The Green Hornet it works.
19197	1	a	In the end, it's all about McDormand, who's great at playing ordinary women in extraordinary circumstances.
19198	5	a	...offers little in the way of entertainment.
19199	4	a	The careful structure of THTRTC guarantees that the movie will generate a fair amount of suspense throughout. But the single-mindedness of the movie is a genuine limitation, and, watching it, you begin to feel spoon-fed.
19200	6	a	So remarkably shapeless you can imagine Shawn and Marlon hashing out scenes between presenters at last year's MTV Video Music Awards.
19201	4	a	If you like horror flicks, you'll like this one....
19202	3	a	"[Roberts] has a down-to-earth, Everywoman quality that adds to the film's ""you go, girl"" mojo."
19203	0	a	This is intense, provocative filmmaking on every level that is sure to be one of the best American films of the year.
19204	3	a	Crimson Peak is a stunning sensory experience.
19205	5	a	A picture whose wildly different components never really coalesce into a satisfying whole.
19206	7	a	Cynical and futile - a total waste of time and money.
19207	6	a	A rather goofy action comedy that deflates the suspense by telling us pretty much everything from the start
19208	10	a	As it happens, not all dogs to to heaven. Some go straight to hell, and Alpha Dog gets there faster and stays there longer than most.
19209	3	a	It's a long and frustrating wait, but While You Were Sleeping delivers all you can ask of a romantic comedy: the deluxe payoff.
19210	0	a	About as viscerally and visually exciting as film can get, and yet it is also fully, ripely romantic in a way that few modern films would dare.
19211	3	a	It's interesting and often amusing stuff, populated as it is with a cast of oddball characters, but it's also uneven, with a tendency to sag for stretches.
19212	4	a	The movie's story, by John Cohen, is pretty thin gruel, but Jon Vitti's smart-aleck script can be quite funny, and the brightly colored animation is appealing.
19213	3	a	An amusing selection of vignettes.
19214	2	a	A cubist soap opera with enough time-shifted twists and turns to induce travel sickness, Broken Embraces is a distinctly disposable offering from Almodovar. Nevertheless, even his throwaway efforts would be considered absolute keepers by most filmmakers.
19215	2	a	A bubbly international cocktail.
19216	3	a	Despite momentary lags in taste, Coppola's film is funny and sweet, while Murray and Johannson are, in turn, sublime and affecting.
19217	7	a	A tiny peek into what the entire Hughes filmography might have been like if Hughes was a dogmatic Marxist.
19218	5	a	If there was ever any doubt that action scenes depend more on context than flash, Fantastic Four proves it.
19219	7	a	[...]Single Moms Club cannot muster up the energy to be as insulting and offensive [or] as overtly, aggressively sexist as most of Perry's films [but the film] feels suspiciously like a glorified pilot for a television show[...]
19220	4	a	While the movie is loaded with lewd attempts to shock, the most radical thing about The To Do List is that it is a sex-positive, strongly female take on the Losing It genre...
19221	6	a	The frequent disorientation makes things drag; it's hard to get a sense of the movie's pace when you're unsure how all these miscellaneous pieces fit together, or even whether they do.
19222	3	a	An unflinching look at the discontent of a suburban couple and the ways they deal with the death of their dream of liberation.
19223	4	a	Though it does feature a few inspired comic moments, there is a surplus of tired, overused gags.
19224	4	a	The world needs another boxing movie like a palooka needs another hit to the head. But it can always use a good story - and Bleed for This certainly qualifies as such.
19225	3	a	It's a difficult trick to pull off this kind of story with the light touch Truffaut gave to Small Change. But Tavernier is a professional, and his doses of gravity and humanity give him a passing grade.
19226	1	a	The result is that valued rarity, an intimate epic.
19227	4	a	Perhaps the first Michael Mann film to almost completely lack a human element; or rather, the human element it possesses is thin and unconvincing.
19228	9	a	The silver screen has rarely felt so lacking in allure, which is either the complete opposite of the point that Spielberg is trying to make or the absolute epitome of it.
19229	3	a	This is a really funny film with some great performances, but sadly the second half shows that Russell lost track of what was important in the story. This still balances out to a good movie, [but] it could have been great had it stayed on course.
19230	7	a	Robin Williams would never stand a chance, either as a presidential candidate or as a TV talk-show comic, a major drawback in a what-if scenario so self-congratulatory and smug.
19231	7	a	A tedious, predictable tale about following your dreams and being yourself.
19232	1	a	American Hustle may be the finest example of how well the Russell formula works, surpassing Silver Linings Playbook and The Fighter, his two most recent Oscar-nominated films.
19233	3	a	[A movie that] makes no apologies for its warmth, laughs at the cynicism of the world around it, and mostly succeeds in the process.
19234	3	a	[Sayles] does more showing than his usual telling, without forsaking his interest in people and the histories and societies that have created their problems.
19235	4	a	Armored won't win any prizes, but it does offer comforting evidence that there's still room for a well-crafted B movie among CG-laden spectacles.
19236	3	a	The setup is so riveting, the suspense so carefully prolonged, that I didn't mind when it unraveled into lunacy near the end.
19237	6	a	This lazily conceived movie wouldn't be much without the strength of its cast, which saves it the string of cliches that might have buried it.
19238	4	a	Sure, it's a bit of a mess, but it's an entertaining mess, and even if it does fly off a cliff towards the end I still can't exactly complain about being burned.
19239	2	a	Gallo packs the film with odd, endearing flourishes that detract a bit from the storyline but add to the overall whole.
19240	6	a	Even those engrossed by the build-up here are likely to kiss off the rest after suffering through Girls' groaner of a wrap-up.
19241	0	a	This is a beautifully crafted, hopeful movie.
19242	4	a	Rogen isn't the obvious choice for a comic book icon but he forces his personality onto this material with an ingratiating ease.
19243	6	a	The silliest movie you'll see this summer.
19244	9	a	"Suffering from an extremely flawed script from which it never recovers, Deep is awesomely bad, and not in a 'Hey, I actually like Starship's ""We Built this City""' way."
19245	3	a	Fascinating and quirky little movie with great bits from Oliver Reed and Leslie Caron.
19246	1	a	...perfect synthesis of singing, dancing, comedy, and satire, a show that brought scintillating dialogue, sharp-edged lyrics, and catchy tunes into sharp focus.
19247	6	a	What it does have is plenty of splatter, noise and energy.
19248	3	a	Love, Simon is a charming and affecting movie that has one foot planted firmly in the past while pushing this genre into the new millennium
19249	3	a	Knocked Up is full of huge laughs and witty pop culture banter but also offers insightful and honest explorations of marriage, relationships, friendship and parenthood.
19250	6	a	By using cliche characters as gags and not actually developing any of its female leads but one it simply reaffirms all the issues its story is trying to dispell. 
19251	5	a	The clumsy script spells out exposition in the most blunt terms and a brave attempt to express subtle emotions in dramatic scenes is doomed by the limitations of the technology and the animator.
19252	3	a	The movie's crazy insistence on going its own way shows flashes of genius.
19253	6	a	Like being trapped inside a huge video game, where exciting, inane images keep popping past your head and the same illogical things keep happening over and over again.
19254	6	a	If it had all continued in the vein explored in the first act, it might have become a great film. But the second act is pandering and the third is trickery.
19255	5	a	Love is beautiful and lovely and as remote as a distant star.
19256	0	a	A cross-cultural masterpiece set in the Amazon.
19257	1	a	Spielberg...displays a progressive and sophisticated awareness of issues of class and race that may be viewed as an apology for the casual imperialist and racist assumptions of his Indiana Jones series.
19258	7	a	"A garden-variety horror movie that provides no innovation on the old ""kids stranded in the woods with a scary monster"" plot."
19259	6	a	At times becomes more absurd than amusing.
19260	0	a	The film is so pitch perfect and realistic, it seems you are there with these people, watching their lives unfold before you as it happens.
19261	3	a	Welcome to Mooseport isn't a belly-laugh farce. It's more along the lines of a My Cousin Vinny, where you just enjoy almost everybody who crosses the screen.
19262	9	a	Cheap laughs, cheap stunts, cheap characters and with absolutely nothing important to say.
19263	3	a	Exceptionally entertaining, but also keenly knowledgeable about music and the history and reverence behind it. Bandslam is more unadulterated fun than it has any right to be.
19264	4	a	"With ""Jurassic Park III"" Johnston inherits the series one film too late. There are only so many ways a dinosaur can chase people through a jungle."
19265	3	a	Russell is a true original. It's not in his DNA to play it safe. He's a rebel Pied Piper, and Huckabees is one more reason to follow him anywhere.
19266	9	a	Dumbed-down, lowest-common-denominator filmmaker with...no scares to be had.
19267	6	a	...it ultimately does seem as though the writer/director simply didn't have enough material to justify a full-length feature.
19268	2	a	The winning conceit of producer/director Lauren Lazin's flamboyant documentary about the life of Tupac Shakur is that the late rapper's voice is the primary source the audience hears.
19269	4	a	The film feels more like an indie art film than a generic shocker.
19270	5	a	Clifford's Really Big Movie is easily consumed and disposed of entertainment for the small fry...
19271	2	a	These three films form a remarkably cohesive whole, both visually and thematically, through their consistently sensitive and often exciting treatment of an ignored people.
19272	6	a	What develops inside this Petri dish is a pretentious and fatally self-conscious piece of work -- the most wearying example to date of a new subgenre we might label 'Sundance Science Fiction.'
19273	5	a	Into the Blue does the impossible - it makes a film featuring a bikini-clad Jessica Alba as dull as a bag of sand
19274	5	a	Thee finished work appears fatally stranded between feminist polemic and accidental magic realism.
19275	6	a	The always immaculate, passionate and soulful Jenifer Lewis -- she could read the words in a phone book and make you feel it. The Hollywood veteran nearly saves the film.
19276	5	a	Watching Max Payne is painful to the max.
19277	2	a	Overt societal disillusionment with a healthy dose of violently expressed xenophobia. Understood.
19278	1	a	Scott and company have approached the film intelligently and have thankfully credited their viewers with having brains as well.
19279	9	a	Stylized, slapdash sci-fi bloodbath is gory and grim.
19280	4	a	Flightplan might not necessary execute the cleverest of landings, but with Jodie Foster onboard, you know it'll at least have an excellent takeoff. 
19281	4	a	Surprisingly enjoyable comedy with strong comic performances, lively direction and several decent gags.
19282	7	a	It hits all the cheap little notes of viewer manipulation that Hollywood hacks rely on to wring tears from the dramatically challenged suckers in the crowd.
19283	8	a	Dull, obvious and unremittingly vulgar.
19284	5	a	Bottom line: nice puppetry, crappy movie.
19285	4	a	Arctic Tale is yet another wildlife orgy of ooh-ing and aah-ing designed to expose young ones to the lifestyles of the furry and the fabulous.
19286	5	a	P.T. Anderson's most uninspired work to date and mostly a worthless waste of time.
19287	1	a	The Infiltrator is so good you'll think you're watching a TV show.
19288	3	a	Spanish actor Javier Bardem should leave audiences gasping with his stone-cold performance in the blood-spattered saga No Country For Old Men.
19289	4	a	This one wares out its welcome with cheesy dialogue and a longer than necessary running time, but check it out when it hits DVD or cable.
19290	4	a	Boasts a real heart-stopper of a finale-an uncanny phosphor nightmare that depicts a marrow-deep fear shared by every kid who grew up in the video age.
19291	5	a	Bland, rote and not at all ooky enough.
19292	4	a	Swingin' but scrambled biopic that never quite finds its rhythm.
19293	2	a	History is handled respectfully, acknowledging what happened and giving victims an honest and predominantly objective voice on one of the most degrading pages in the book of humankind.
19294	4	a	Pitt, toying with his death-wish like some private joke, is eminently watchable in a role with little developmental arc; while Affleck, as his unwitting nemesis, takes his own mysterious integrity right to the grave.
19295	5	a	"Saint Laurent"" is dazzling to behold, for a while. But at two-and-a-half hours, it gets old, especially if you're not familiar enough with the man's life story to piece together exactly what's happening."
19296	3	a	While the premise of the film is outlandish, the feelings are all real...Director Vogt-Roberts and screenwriter Chris Galletta are in perfect unison on this film, harmonizing to create what feels like a fresh comic voice.
19297	3	a	Benedict Cumberbatch is thrilling to watch; you sense the joy he must get out of his acting especially when in such a juicy role.
19298	0	a	The film is not really a great suspense film, but really a fantastic introspective drama into the mind of a person much like the master of suspense himself.
19299	10	a	Other than confusing children, it's hard to know what the inane, tedious, mean-spirited Barnyard is trying to do.
19300	0	a	What really distinguishes [Zhao's] work here is something beyond great filmmaking chops: a vision that is deeply humanistic, founded on a compassionate realism that honors the heartfelt struggles of all the creatures it encounters.
19301	6	a	"All the characters from the prior four Fast and Furious films are rounded up to do their own grease monkey version of ""Ocean's Eleven"" by Chris Morgan's enjoyably ludicrous script, which, by right's, should have been called ""Toretto's Ten."" "
19302	8	a	McCarthy's bloody and beautiful novel comes to life under the Coen's able touch.
19303	3	a	Resident Evil is a rabid zombie thriller that splatters on the screen with gruesome joy. Intense, loud and fast-paced, this is the best video game-turned-movie ever.
19304	4	a	The Tourist gives background extras more to do than milling around and faking conversation. Each are also instructed to interrupt whatever they're doing when Jolie sashays by, to offer approving nods for her backside. Nice work, if you can get it.
19305	1	a	You're likely to be as smiling as much as George Valentin.
19306	3	a	Side-splittingly hilarious, The World's End deftly balances its character work with lashings of comedy and impressive action sequences.
19307	0	a	The depiction of the rocket launch remains one of the most exhilarating sequences ever captured on film; so realistic that NASA wondered where the filmmakers got the footage.
19308	3	a	An accessible piece of work by one of the medium's great masters.
19309	7	a	Even if they were the best actors in the world, the movie leading up to [the act] is just this thing. It just happens. 
19310	6	a	Although it has its moments, Couples Retreat isn't so much a movie but rather a giant excuse for some real-life BFFs to hang out in South Pacific.
19311	4	a	One for the die hards. The saving grace here is a knowing sense of humour so lacking in its predecessor, For Your Eyes Only.
19312	6	a	Tame, predictable and a little dull.
19313	7	a	The L.A. of Black Or White is so absurdly synthetic and divorced from the real world that a stiff breeze could blow the whole thing into the Pacific. 
19314	1	a	Despite dragging a little, Mystic River is worth its weight in what will certainly be Oscar gold.
19315	6	a	At first, anyway, it's mildly amusing. But before too long, all this whimsical, metaphysical meandering and smarty-pants wordplay grows wearisome.
19316	5	a	[If you must], come for the jokes, the song and dance numbers, and the female camaraderie. Stay for... well, for those things
19317	3	a	It's one of those movies that will reveal more and more to youngsters as they rewatch it in years to come... and that's the best kind of film.
19318	2	a	Although it plays by the standard beats of the sports comedy, Early Man scores thanks to Aardman's trademark charm and wit.
19319	4	a	A gentle fable whose humanist heart beats in Michel Piccoli's nuanced performance.
19320	4	a	It's a difficult film to sit through, but if you allow yourself to sit back and be immersed into the strange and despicable world which Cronenberg creates with these characters, then you may just find something there that resonates.
19321	7	a	Sade achieves the near-impossible: It turns the Marquis de Sade into a dullard.
19322	3	a	Viewers will fall into two camps -- those who think it's a mentally unstable mess, and those who think it's a work of insane genius. Can't it be both?
19323	4	a	Moore and Duchovny's on-screen connection is sizzling and both stars excel in unravelling their hard-bitten characters' fragility.
19324	6	a	The bulk of Secret Window is best summed up by another of the film's thematic constants-a primary character's pathological taste for corn.
19325	3	a	Smart, conflicted, and immensely entertaining.
19326	3	a	Director Pete Travis keeps things grim and gritty and moving.
19327	2	a	Jenkins is a provocateur to be sure, but she also has a heart, which is why her films don't come across as mean even when dealing comically with issues of death, debilitation, and emotional trauma.
19328	6	a	an uneven path, like the mountainous scenery itself
19329	6	a	Is it that big a deal to have a cast that includes Steve Austin, Randy Couture and Terry Crews? These guys would line up for a straight-to-DVD American Pie sequel if asked.
19330	3	a	It is a tale of white trash immorality on a grand scale, of people who are ridiculous and yet dangerous, laughable but cunning, and really stupid ... yet sneaky.
19331	3	a	As you'd expect, it's beautiful, emotional and exciting, if florid in style. Bale, beauties and English dialogue widen Yimou's appeal.
19332	5	a	Love, Simon harbors no creatives of color behind the camera, yet Greg Berlanti and writers Isaac Aptaker and Elizabeth Berger succeed in tapping their powers of empathy to portray non-white characters with depth.
19333	4	a	"If you want your beefcake and cheesecake served up against an ocean setting, you'll get ""Into the Blue,"" a decent thriller with lots of skin, sharks and sun."
19334	4	a	Much like how Liv Tyler's beauty is softened by the affectless drone of her voice, the film's stylish flash is made less inviting by some dullness in design.
19335	1	a	The Prestige quite brilliantly replicates the experience of a great magic trick. You know what you have just seen isn't possible, and while you recognize some of the trickery, you can't spell it all out. You walk away completely amazed.
19336	4	a	Gothically impressive visuals rise... story unfortunately fizzles.
19337	2	a	Arguably the most intelligent horror film in many years, it's a movie with undeniably high aspirations.
19338	0	a	As played by Mara, Lisbeth is the ultimate badass; a formidable force of hyperintellect and raging sexuality. 
19339	4	a	A handsome new sci-fi adventure that feels rather familiar. Enjoyable enough while it lasts, John Carter is big on ambition and disappointingly short on action.
19340	6	a	Did you ever get the feeling that Brian DePalma designs entire films around set pieces he thinks would be really cool?
19341	0	a	Not fiction; not documentary. Instead, a story standing under a chimerical moon while fate, laconic and inarticulate like its victims, growls from far off.
19342	2	a	If you get a thrill from seeing what look very much like live dinosaurs alive today, the film is for you.
19343	2	a	[Theron] plays an unredeemable woman with uncompromising reality. That's a powerful accomplishment, even if Monster never quite figures out what to do with it.
19344	2	a	The exceptional cast turned the garden-variety script they were given into a movie that should please crowds throughout the holiday season.
19345	3	a	An entertaining and good-spirited romance that celebrates the marvelous possibilities of life. Don't be surprised if you find yourself dancing out of the theater.
19346	0	a	It will spare you no mercy.
19347	1	a	The film would have been a stunner under any circumstances, but with the situation in Afghanistan and the Middle East worsening on a daily basis, No Man's Land feels even more relevant.
19348	3	a	Enjoyable, engaging and beautifully made drama with stunning special effects and terrific performances from Brad Pitt and Cate Blanchett.
19349	3	a	As a Clint Eastwood experiment, and a sincere tribute to the heroism of the three men involved, it succeeds with its earnestness.
19350	0	a	A bona fide classic. You won't get the smile off your face all the way home.
19351	4	a	"The Light Between Oceans"" is easily one of the year's most visually stunning films. Ironically, it's also one of the most difficult to watch."
19352	6	a	Potent but problematic.
19353	6	a	Some movies are on auto-pilot from the get-go. Failure To Launch doesn't even have a pilot.
19354	4	a	... tells a gripping true story efficiently. ... And yet, it still feels too packaged, too neat, too clean.
19355	0	a	PTA, Pynchon, Phoenix and co. produce something unavoidably brilliant. 
19356	5	a	There's nothing here a good dose of Viagra couldn't cure. Impotent and dull as dishwater.
19357	3	a	Apatow's part in the rehab of the mainstream comedy relies on the underlying yearnings of archetypal social strivers.
19358	5	a	"The best way to enjoy ""Mars Needs Moms""? Skip the movie and watch the closing credits."
19359	3	a	It's a visually arresting adventure, but it arrives at its final destination with little dramatic resonance.
19360	4	a	The film paints a convincing portrait of Tupac as a true artist whose talents embraced a big chunk of entertainment: acting, music, poetry, dance.
19361	3	a	As one of Spielberg's purest suspense rides, it's gimmicky, giddy, and still great value.
19362	5	a	Strictly for Elvis fans.
19363	4	a	For those who are drawn to re-creations of historical controversies that pack more gravitas and outright tragedy, Chappaquiddick could prove satisfying enough, especially with the in-vogue-again Kennedy clan at the center.
19364	3	a	The drama is filled with raw emotions and evinces an incredible honesty in terms of storytelling. The filmmaking style reflects, even more, the vivid three-dimensionality of the characters.
19365	0	a	This movie doesn't just stand the test of time, it transcends it.
19366	0	a	There's the uncanny sensation that Theron has forgotten the camera and the script and is directly channeling her ideas about Aileen Wuornos. She has made herself the instrument of this character.
19367	4	a	It's definitely not the book-and that's good. Unfortunately, however, it's not a great movie either.
19368	6	a	I've seen worse comedies this year, and I'll see better.
19369	5	a	Uneven family/marriage dramedy has some mature themes.
19370	4	a	"The spirit of Eric Rohmer lives vibrantly in the luscious-looking ""Call Me by Your Name."" But, unfortunately, not his talent."
19371	3	a	This thought-provoking film remains a key work by Scorsese, a courageous and imaginative take on one of the greatest stories ever told.
19372	5	a	An Eastern movie made to resemble the most unchallenging Western ideal of what the East is.
19373	4	a	The script ... is chock full of callow teenybopper deep-think about how unfair the SAT is, but it's more interesting for the different ways the students justify their foray into high-tech burglary, and for the way they pull off the heist.
19374	4	a	The delicate art of impersonating self
19375	5	a	The intent is to rivet the viewer's attention, but the movie is so relentless in imposing its deliberately dazzling technique that audiences are liable to be annoyed instead.
19376	3	a	It's fun to watch the clever, dryly comic, quintessential can man's con.
19377	2	a	I was very moved by this film.
19378	3	a	Eminem manages to take all that we think we know about Eminem and inject it into his character without turning the character into a simple screen version of himself.
19379	0	a	This brilliant Hawks Western, one of the decade's best, has been interpreted in different ways, but at its core is the contrast between John Wayne's and Montgomery Clift's leadership style and perception of manhood.
19380	6	a	A great big summer effects movie that makes very little sense but provides a wild ride.
19381	3	a	Jackson and Ricci are terrific, deftly negotiating the film's shifting currents of the lurid and the spiritual. And the music cooks.
19382	3	a	The languidly-paced picture has a staggering array of beautiful images and vistas.
19383	4	a	Overrated and surprisingly sour.
19384	4	a	While not a total failure, what would the result have been had director Peter Berg been able decide what he wanted his movie to be? As it stands, Hancock is a wildly uneven ho-hum affair that really should've have been much more.
19385	0	a	The film is as historically important as it is dramatic, and every high school student should see it.
19386	6	a	It's a good, workmanlike popcorn movie, but nothing more
19387	5	a	A rare misfire for the usually reliable Lee.
19388	4	a	So what if The Kings of Summer backs away from greatness and builds itself a little fort in indie comedy central instead? That's not so bad. It's still a pretty neat fort.
19389	5	a	I don't why they made it.
19390	3	a	A drunk Lee Marvin on a horse to match makes this comedy western classic.
19391	5	a	And any power these explicit scenes have is in any case undermined by the absurd tweeness of the final moments.
19392	4	a	It's the quieter moments where Oyelowo really excels.
19393	10	a	Easily one of the most boring, incoherent and overproduced movies ever made. And at two full hours, it's far too much of a bad thing.
19394	10	a	Yet another action-thriller that just isn't very thrilling.
19395	2	a	It truly captures the spirit of an entire way of life that no longer exists.
19396	1	a	Word of mouth should quickly ensure that New Lion Cinemas has another hit on their hands.
19397	4	a	Spielberg seems to be dividing his filmmaking output into two distinct halves: in the summer months cranking out no-brainer dinosaur flicks...in the winter season unveiling his serious artistic stuff to edify the adults and woo the Oscar crowd.
19398	3	a	For those who would question Crichton's motives, Levinson and Attanasio haven't let men off the hook.
19399	9	a	Then, there's the seen-that-before scene of poor Matt walking around with a protrusion he seems blithely unaware of that seems to go to some preposterously immense proportions.
19400	3	a	A top-notch grindhouse flick perfect for the Halloween season. It's also the best this series has seen in twenty years.
19401	5	a	Foster's go-for-broke plunge into the material makes the flimsy twists barely tolerable.
19402	3	a	The past has never seemed so inviting as it does in Colin Trevorrow's DIY time-travel romance.
19403	4	a	Cinematic cotton candy, but it goes down easily, even if there's not a lot of nourishment in it.
19404	3	a	The film's funny and absurd enough to make its maddeningly veiled musings on the death of the hippy dream engrossing. A large part of this is down to Phoenix, whose protagonist... is an undeniably rich creation.
19405	2	a	The anger over the injustice of the financial collapse and bailout is what powered the Tea Party movement as well as the Occupy Wall Street movement, and it powers this movie, too.
19406	4	a	Not vintage Aardman, but there's still fun to be had.
19407	4	a	As usual, Cronenberg shows masterful control, starting with Pattinson.
19408	3	a	The film is as funny and original as Wright and Pegg's previous efforts, even if time and familiarity with the pair's comedy stylings has rendered it not quite as fresh.
19409	3	a	The Rover is ultimately less interested in what's driven the world to ruin than it is in life amid the wreckage, a place as dangerous to the soul as the body. 
19410	4	a	You have to admire the thoroughness with which We Bought a Zoo - which is the film Disney would make if they still knew how - caters to the whole family.
19411	4	a	Chamber of Secrets is fairly fun despite its length.
19412	3	a	Yes, the script is a tad silly at times but a game cast -- Wasikowska was born to wander dark corridors -- and del Toro's eye for detail make for a stylish and scary shocker.
19413	0	a	A truly amazing film that takes a western audience to mystical places they have never seen before.
19414	4	a	Blood is splattered on walls, pre-teen students are turned to stone, a Poltergeist-ian tree tries to smash our heroes, spiders rampage across the Dark Forest and a giant snake cruises menacingly through dank catacombs.
19415	7	a	A special-effects monster movie that's a deliriously loopy combination of the Underworld films, the Highlander franchise, and a brick of Swiss cheese.
19416	2	a	A bleaker, less colorful descendant of the Mad Max films, replacing the rollicking action of that franchise with a mood of nihilistic despair.
19417	7	a	It's a one-dimensional detective noir rather than an exciting shoot-em-up.
19418	4	a	An absorbing mindblender cut short by a tacked-on political ending that tries to assign meaning to it all.
19419	3	a	The World's End is classic British comedy: It's anarchy versus conformity with conformity never standing a chance.
19420	9	a	This film was a mess, and easily the most disappointing film of the whole year.
19421	3	a	A love letter to the beautiful mechanism of a motion picture camera.
19422	0	a	If Lucas is Raiders' guts and Kasdan its head, then Spielberg is its beating heart. Little wonder Part IV is still on the cards.
19423	6	a	The film is beautifully photographed like a Hallmark tourist postcard...
19424	6	a	Keeping up with the Joneses is tough. Derrick Borte should have learned this before deciding to write, produce, and direct his first major film, a slice of social commentary that loses focus as it unspools.
19425	4	a	"A strange hybrid of ""City of Life and Death"" and ""Father Goose"" that nevertheless, in the hands of Zhang Yimou, musters a few striking moments."
19426	1	a	Deliver Us From Evil will shake you to your marrow. It should be seen by people of all faiths and by anyone concerned about the wellbeing of children.
19427	1	a	Nothing turns out as it seems, and the surreal finale to the film elevate the movie to being one of the Coens' best.
19428	3	a	One to remember.
19429	2	a	Romero's zombie movies have always been about people, not zombies. That's what makes them work so well and Land of the Dead is no exception.
19430	6	a	Robert Pattinson works mighty hard to make Cosmopolis more than just an erudite slap at modern capitalism. The Twilight heartthrob ultimately fails to rescue a meandering story hitting stale versions of the same talking points.
19431	3	a	The plot has a few glitches, but generally the film is funny, sweet and thoughtful.
19432	0	a	Donnie Darko ranks among Gattaca, Pi and Dark City for pure imagination -- and surpasses them for astonishing execution.
19433	6	a	A movie of this sort should never leave the viewer cold, and that, alas, is what this one does.
19434	3	a	One can only hope that Becoming Jane will inspire moviegoers to find out more about this beloved literary great. Or hopefully revisit one of her classic novels.
19435	3	a	Smith and Mendes are terrific together. He brings her game up so high you'd think she has had as many good parts as Smith.
19436	5	a	Characters are not developed enough. You don't feel for them. Result being, you end up as mere spectators instead of well-wishers. While the film preaches 'passion' for whatever you do, it is exactly what seems to be missing from it.
19437	3	a	...an evocative crime drama, anchored by Cranston's gift for playing internal conflict with wordless expression and that deep, clinched voice... a screenplay riddled with conformity to other undercover movies.
19438	4	a	Bourne's amnesia gimmick is a tired one, but there is a future in spy movies with this sort of blend of action and cynicism.
19439	6	a	Impossible to hate because of its appealing cast and peppy script. But it's just not dramatic or funny enough to be memorable. Instead, it's just meh.
19440	5	a	This unabashedly stupid comedy is, well, unabashedly stupid.
19441	7	a	When it comes to keeping the colored folk peripheral, this picture makes To Kill a Mockingbird look like Get on the Bus.
19442	4	a	It nearly overwhelms its own inherent magical wonders and characters with an emphasis on action, but the movie also manages to work its way out from under the heavy hallowed aura that partially smothered the fun of its predecessor.
19443	1	a	Joel and Ethan Coen, working from a novel by Cormac McCarthy, have made one of the darkest and best movies of the year.
19444	3	a	You can literally see Bourne star Matt Damon enjoying himself at the centre of this heartwarming family movie - and it will make all the difference to your appreciation of it, too.
19445	6	a	Harrison Ford can't save Air Force One
19446	1	a	Wickedly enjoyable dark comedy.
19447	7	a	Hollywood kids the Democrats because the love the Democrats.
19448	4	a	Predictable romantic comedy.
19449	2	a	Serenity is first and foremost a movie that will fulfill the hopes and dreams of each and every Firefly fan.
19450	5	a	Detroit-born independent filmmaker Preston A. Whitmore II's astonishingly inept drama revolves around the high-stakes world of streetball and the efforts of two teenagers to resist its flash and cash temptations.
19451	2	a	Sayles demonstrates a remarkable ability to fully flesh out characters who are on-screen for only a short time.
19452	9	a	Maybe what the movie needed was more professional discipline and less geniality. As a rule, it's probably better to throw the party after the filming is finished.
19453	6	a	none of it's any more impressive than the stuff you can find in your average video game.
19454	1	a	McDormand is in fine form as the foul-mouthed Mildred, ready to chew up anyone in her way. In a blink, Rockwell goes from over-the-top to subtle to hateful to sympathetic. Harrelson is also marvelous, hiding any personal pain and fears behind a smirk.
19455	9	a	Japanese horror junk featuring American actors.
19456	6	a	Fitfully floppy - but Sony profits are flying high.
19457	5	a	Landis at his most cameo-obsessed and self-indulgent.
19458	3	a	A spy thriller for espionage fans who feel that James Bond has gone soft in the head.
19459	3	a	And although the pace is uneven and the plot seems stretched thin, Chicken Run is still worth a look
19460	4	a	A well-crafted yet essentially innocuous period piece.
19461	6	a	It's a passionate love story executed in a dull fashion.
19462	1	a	Bolt is a jolt of joy, a computer-animated delight that is delirious with laughs.
19463	9	a	Black America's answer to Birth of a Nation. Security is probably the most racist film I've ever seen.
19464	5	a	A bizarre action thriller, it has a good beginning, a decent but unbelievable middle, and a last reel that's so weird and risible that the audience begins laughing out of embarrassment and disbelief.
19465	6	a	A handsomely shot, cool-sounding head-scratcher of a film that probably isn't worth the wear on the fingernails.
19466	2	a	This movie is so drenched with testosterone, it belongs on Major League Baseball's banned substances list.
19467	5	a	There's nothing here for adults and older kids to enjoy.
19468	3	a	This one is a feast for the eyeballs, a treat for the romantically-inclined, and a full-course feast for the action aficionados.
19469	7	a	Comes across like a bad 'Saturday Night Live' political sketch, dragged on for way too long ... a lot of great talent wasted.
19470	1	a	Jack Goes Boating. You should go boating, too. 
19471	9	a	"Even as pure eye-candy ""Into The Blue"" is a miserable failure."
19472	7	a	An action flick that gets bogged down with unlikely plot twists. Paul Chambers, CNN.
19473	3	a	Outrageously funny and captivating, but ultimately undercooked. Sally Field knocks it out of the ballpark with one of the best performances of her career. 
19474	5	a	Women deserve a better vehicle for demonstrating the power of female solidarity than this empty money grab.
19475	1	a	The key is in the title ... and the dawning realization that the movie is structured like a truly original magic trick.
19476	2	a	Even if the film bogs down a touch in its own sense of cuteness near the end, this film will do as a family-wide X-mas time waster if everyone has It's a Wonderful Life overload.
19477	1	a	The film snaps, crackles and pops with visual ingenuity.
19478	3	a	The drivel they call 'reality TV' pales in comparison.
19479	4	a	A genuinely moving story is wrung dry by filmmaking that strains to punch every emotional plot point. Solid performances and some edgy insight can't quite rescue it, although the extraordinary true events retain real power.
19480	6	a	a great example of a woulda-coulda-shoulda movie
19481	3	a	[B]race for an unflinching contemporary crime drama that makes no concessions to pop nostalgia or mocking remakes such as the no-brow Starsky and Hutch.
19482	6	a	...rarely holds the viewer's interest in as rapt a manner as Hecker presumably intended.
19483	4	a	It's a bit of a challenge to watch, but Javier Bardem fans will want to check it out.
19484	4	a	An unwieldy hodgepodge of spectacular set pieces and sappy family drama.
19485	5	a	Denzel Washington and Bob Hoskins in an action-ghost-buddy comedy? Uh huh.
19486	3	a	Consummate Warner Bros. melodrama, with Bette excellent as misfit and even better as reborn glamour-puss.
19487	8	a	a grindingly dull western-revenge-supernatural-terrorist-save-the-world mishmash that fails on every level. Did I ask why Megan Fox is here?
19488	5	a	Battle of the Year would rather use crowd-shot cutaways to convince you of the dancers' prowess than focusing on the stage.
19489	5	a	Celia Ahern's chick-lit novel about two friends who are secretly in love has been made into a not-quite-rubbish Brit romcom.
19490	7	a	As bland as corn flakes.
19491	6	a	A film which has little to say, and even less idea of the most appropriate way to say it.
19492	3	a	"The Kings of Summer"" invokes [John Hughes movies] without Xeroxing them, creating its own little oddball suburbia."
19493	4	a	Hancock tries to reinvent the superhero movie - until it loses interest in its own story.
19494	1	a	An above-average and massively entertaining international thriller.
19495	1	a	From Highsmith's bold story, Haynes fashions a remarkable study of emotions brought to life by two of the best movie performances of the year.
19496	4	a	Most of the time, it's fun to watch.
19497	0	a	What the visual immediacy of Schindler's List does is to prod each of us to fill in the gaps of emotion for ourselves. To put this another way, the more you are able to invest in this superb, demanding film, the more you are likely to get back.
19498	3	a	Stage-bound, but classic
19499	5	a	A dull exercise in deconstructing Jane Austen's life to provide a life experience basis for her novels.
19500	4	a	This effective blend of genial light comedy and intelligent drama is the best thing Fey has done as a film performer by a considerable space.
19501	3	a	Movies about saying goodbye to childhood friends, and finding them again, work on our emotional defenses like nothing else.
19502	2	a	[Evelyn] is a fit film for the holidays with its uplifting tale of one man who fights back against the injustice of the system...
19503	5	a	It's a spray of dots that never connect, like a Pointillist painting that never forms a picture.
19504	5	a	The Incredibles promotes a new moral slogan for our times: The family that fights evil-doers together stays together.
19505	3	a	In an era of hiply self-referential teen horror, Verbinski cribs from the genre's best and gets back to the basics of disquieting creepiness and stylish, atmospheric scares.
19506	6	a	By the time the two travellers have eaten their first proper meal together, Jacques' food obsession is starting to look more like bourgeois self-indulgence.
19507	6	a	Hannibal Rising isn't much more than appetizer.
19508	3	a	It's ultimately the piece's surprisingly sincere, compassionate edge which transmits the most.
19509	4	a	Snakes plus a plane plus a year of Internet hype do not a blockbuster make.
19510	3	a	Part The Great Escape and part Lawrence of Arabia, it is ambitious in scope, grand in vision and rich with examples of the resilience of the human spirit. 
19511	7	a	Strangely remote and uninvolving on both emotional and spiritual levels.
19512	6	a	A marriage-renewal comedy with a decent cast, a few good ideas and no clear grasp on what to do with them.
19513	3	a	An indescribably cool post-apocalyptic martial arts fairy tale.
19514	3	a	It's clear that animators can now achieve levels of visual depth that were previously impossible.
19515	5	a	It's wonderfully shot, with moments of rawness, but Coppola can't shake the suffocating been-there, done-that atmosphere of the film. 
19516	4	a	Good try, some funny and clever ideas, but not really worth the time.
19517	1	a	A slick, energetic movie with good performances and a lot of genuine human interest.
19518	8	a	Its unremitting coarseness and utterly amoral attitude will be excruciating for most viewers to sit through.
19519	5	a	Despite many charming elements, this movie is not an example of good storytelling.
19520	6	a	So much...is bungled with inept storytelling and watered-down dialogue, and Story is so powerless to right the course, that Fantastic Four winds up more dopey than fun.
19521	5	a	An uneven film and overlong, but not without some merit.
19522	4	a	Jarmusch blends these disparate themes into a cohesive film that combines humor and truly unique characters with Eastern philosophy, mobster flick and shoot-'em-up western.
19523	6	a	It might have helped a bit if there had been a hero worth rooting for.
19524	3	a	This is [Sandra] Bullock and [Hugh] Grant's show all the way, and they make the most out of a tried-and-true formula.
19525	5	a	I think the fault lies with Clint Eastwood the director, who has made too many easy decisions about events, about the management of atmosphere, about the treatment of performances.
19526	3	a	"Nebraska"" bears Payne's trademark combination of low-key humor, poignancy and an overall feeling of Beckett-esque resignation."
19527	5	a	Its plot is stretched thin. Its creativity is nearly invisible. Its logic is rocky. And the whole enterprise goes up in flames.
19528	4	a	Tense, well directed, adequately acted and frequently funny.
19529	3	a	"I Give It a Year"" is a smart farce that would make Hugh Grant and his fans proud."
19530	4	a	As lean and taut as the muscles on Jodie Foster's fine- boned face, Flightplan is a terrific-looking thriller that wastes no time with embellishment or asides.
19531	4	a	Hoffman, the unofficial king of indie films, gets a bit too precious with his directorial debut.
19532	3	a	The material is played mostly for laughs and succeeds in that regard. The undercurrent of lament in Safety Not Guaranteed, though, is what holds the film together.
19533	9	a	The acting rarely surpasses the occasional sexy hair-toss.
19534	2	a	What Bolt lacks in originality it makes up for in execution.
19535	3	a	Those expecting more than silly fun will surely be disappointed.
19536	0	a	f a better, funnier, smarter, more endearing film than Chicken Run comes along this year, I will eat a live chicken and shoot the feathers out my butt.
19537	4	a	You just can't quite enter the world of this film, not in the way that you might have if a more nuanced and less iconic actor had played the central role.
19538	5	a	Darned if the thing doesn't feel like a Saturday-morning adventure cartoon stretched out to feature-length.
19539	4	a	Tim Allen made his feature debut in this engaging yuletide comedy, which is likely to appeal to the whole family and brims over with plenty of good ideas.
19540	2	a	[McDonagh's] third film finds him back in form with a pitch black, if not quite pitch perfect, comedy brought to life by an outstanding cast.
19541	9	a	The point seems to be that too much of a good thing leads to a vast sense of nothingness and bleak cinematography. Alas, it also results in transforming a film about a sensualist into a remarkably sexless enterprise.
19542	3	a	A gear shift for a director whose weathered career is jolted back to life, matching bouncy dialogue and a whimsically comical plot with the glossy climes of the sepia toned city of love.
19543	0	a	An unusual conceit brilliantly executed. A moving work of golden fantasy poised just above the dark waters of our own mortality.
19544	2	a	A fresh hybrid of zombie horror, high-tech sci-fi and butt-kicking thrill ride.
19545	6	a	It doesn't feel like you're in outer space, nor even cyberspace. It feels like Ohio.
19546	5	a	While the film is undeniably well-made, its outlook is so dark it crosses the line into making viewers feel more miserable than enlightened or entertained.
19547	3	a	The film's gentle, empathetic tone might seem a little toothless compared to the peril or conflict of Koreeda's earlier work, but it's a warm, embracing joy of a movie to watch.
19548	0	a	The Sandlot is a kids flick that will always stand the test of the time and be a movie that you can watch over and over as you grow older. It never loses its touch.
19549	4	a	The performances are solid, but more often than not it feels like the characters are all acting, shooting and stabbing in a vacuum.
19550	4	a	This movie isn't bad for mere entertainment, but it's overshadowed by other, better movies in the same genre.
19551	4	a	A charming teen comedy from Sweden.
19552	4	a	It's undeniably fun, but also pretty chaotic and inconsistent. [Full review in Spanish]
19553	5	a	Carey drops the ball with a script that's both meandering and mean-spirited, not to mention laughter deficient.
19554	4	a	I have a feeling I know who the true bad guy is...a little monster known as studio meddling.
19555	4	a	A reasonably intelligent adult comedy.
19556	9	a	This movie is awful... but it was never even remotely close to being funny. Or good. Or even indifferent.
19557	3	a	A likable actress, Field bravely makes Doris a challenge to like. And against all likelihood, we're captivated.
19558	5	a	Sienna Miller gives a sexy, emotionally intense performance, but the film is so poorly conceived and structurally messy that it fails to illuminate the starlet or her times--add it to the growing list of failed indies about Warhol and entourage.
19559	3	a	Fun, full of action, and just serious enough to work without becoming ridiculous.
19560	3	a	This is a film Walt himself would have been proud of, a family flick that's marvelously gratifying no matter what your age.
19561	0	a	Moving. Powerful. Epic. Beautiful.
19562	2	a	Nick Offerman provides laughs as the cranky, clumsily emotional dad in this coming-of-age, teens-gone-not-so-wild comedy.
19563	9	a	Levinson never seems to know what to point his camera at, or when to cut, and Glazer never seems to know when to leave a joke alone and let the cast work.
19564	6	a	De Palma makes the mistake of revealing the mastermind behind an assassination conspiracy before the movie is half over, thus leaving himself with nothing to work with.
19565	4	a	Pooh's innocent philosophy hits the sweet spot - even McGregor's earnest plodder benefits from his proximity to the film's real star.
19566	9	a	Here is a movie in which even the arrows are loud. If it was an attempt to drown out the dialogue and obscure the plot, it didn't succeed.
19567	8	a	A bracing, mesmerizing, bitterly funny and deeply unsettling fable.
19568	6	a	The only thing that makes the game streetball, as is explained by overexpository dialogue, is that strict rules aren't really enforced, and the players are allowed to travel. I know what you're thinking -- how is this different from the NBA?
19569	3	a	Directed in a grand expressionist style by Michael Curtiz.
19570	4	a	While the Rashomon-like multiple versions of events are riveting, Cox's main misstep is to leave out real resonance.
19571	4	a	From a romantic standpoint, the most beautiful aspect of Love, Simon is that through nothing but emails it's believable that these two students could fall for one another; it's not about physical appearances or social status or anything superficial
19572	6	a	...unapologetically geared towards younger viewers...
19573	2	a	The bravura performance of Annette Bening, as late, great femme fatale Gloria Grahame, is the main reason to see it.
19574	5	a	The last thing this film wants to do is make a believable world.
19575	3	a	If you've always longed to see a version of Double Indemnity played out by in-bred, under-educated psychopaths, then your time has finally come.
19576	3	a	When it comes to searing and iconic visual imagery, Spielberg is still the best filmmaker around.
19577	3	a	Any serious, dark-minded child who's up on High Noon, The Good, the Bad and the Ugly, Chinatown, Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas and the writings of Carlos Castaneda will really find their precociousness rewarded.
19578	5	a	I, Robot is a movie destined for fast-forward buttons the world over.
19579	2	a	Above everything else, Russell has an unerring talent for drawing out the best from his actors. Everyone here is in top form, though [Bradley] Cooper's near-manic FBI agent dictates some odd acting choices.
19580	3	a	O tom de constante humor negro funciona ainda melhor do que no filme original.
19581	4	a	There is a lot to enjoy here. Tamahori's second Hollywood outing is economically directed, the scenery is spectacular and beautifully shot by Donald M. McAlpine and the initial air crash rivals Alive for its sudden, chaotic realism.
19582	7	a	Transylmania's characters are intensely irritating and its comedy is so obvious that you'll see the film's limp attempts at jokes coming a mile away.
19583	7	a	"Ben and Gwynneth, ""just friends"" or no, have a lovely, believable chemistry that isn't all hot sex or amusing rapid fire witticisms."
19584	3	a	Effective action, solid suspense, excellent Ribisi, plus enough cliches to equal the grains of Gobi sand that fill the screen.
19585	1	a	McDonagh's movie is a four-course meal, with writing so sharp and performances so bold and sly that it's tough to leave the theater unmoved.
19586	3	a	In the end, it's the visuals of this film that you want to see, and Cameron doesn't disappoint.
19587	1	a	Think of Lost in Translation as a beautifully told short story. It doesn't have the resonance or heft of a good novel, but it's slyly seductive and intensely moody.
19588	4	a	A dark, uneven character study.
19589	7	a	What human speech manages to break through the tedious, impenetrable jargon is so compressed and weighted with exposition that it feels more like notes for an outline than actual conversation.
19590	4	a	Can you dig it? Maybe, if you aren't already up to your tie-dyed shorts in Woodstock memories, and if you can accept that there's relatively little music in this happy-go-lucky movie about history's most celebrated music festival.
19591	9	a	Rob Marshall doesn't know the difference between a geisha and a glass of water.
19592	4	a	When getting into the nitty-gritty of tapes and tracks, Grohl makes a strong case for music docs directed by musicians.
19593	0	a	An act of pure, unadulterated creativity that boasts its narrative gambles and poetic whimsy as badges of honor... One of the most improbably gorgeous films of the year.
19594	9	a	For all the comedians, there just aren't enough jokes unless you are shooting for the revolting variety.
19595	0	a	With its dizzying alternations of comedy and horror, the film is unmistakably a Coen brothers movie -- albeit a much better one than they've made in a while.
19596	4	a	Narrated by Julie Andrews with Marsden gleefully camping it up and Adams the personification of winning charm, only a Scrooge would deny the film possesses oodles of fun and wit. It's just not as enchanting as it deserves to be.
19597	5	a	Hanson's enthusiastic participation in the project is bewildering given how pedestrian the story is: poor, white kid keeps getting beaten down before a final showdown...
19598	6	a	A listless excursion into the luxurious problems of rich, white people.
19599	4	a	The story is preposterous but then so is being a teenager, and while those years grow increasingly distant, I suspect the intended audience will still identify with its characters.
19600	4	a	"As a slight feminist western, JANE is a good movie. Considering we're in the ""dump month"" of January, a good western genre flick is more than welcome."
19601	6	a	Mr. Johnston keeps the action and one-liners coming and, before you know it, it's over.
19602	4	a	The set is spectacular, the cast is stellar, but Guillermo del Toro's haunted costume drama is short on drama - and scares.
19603	5	a	The action and dialogue find the same squalid level in time for the climactic scene, the cruel humiliation of a central character.
19604	0	a	Orson Welles was ahead of his time.
19605	3	a	So Burton-esque is this world that it remains baffling that he didn't direct, megaphone duties instead falling to Henry Selick.
19606	9	a	Bad news: Donald Trump is in Two Weeks Notice, and he's not even the most annoying thing in the movie.
19607	2	a	While the film certainly has its fair spray of black comedy, not all of it that amusing, it turns out, to its benefit, to be far more morally layered, unpredictable and thoughtful than its marketing campaign suggests.
19608	2	a	It's all a bit shapeless, yet made with sincerity and taste, and the two actors seize your sympathy.
19609	4	a	The sickest, most perverted movie within memory. Guiltily, I liked it. But what the hell is it?
19610	2	a	The film is a contrivance, as artificial as the video games Japanese teens play in a nightclub sequence, but it's an enjoyable one.
19611	4	a	The film itself is like the cinematic equivalent of a clothesline, with a steady stream of skits and gags hung out to dry.
19612	3	a	The tigers are cool, the monkeys are cute, but deep down, Crowe is more interested in the characters. And so are we. 
19613	0	a	While seemingly a straightforward murder mystery in a matter-of-fact setting, it is never quite what it seems, and it percolates with themes and ideas of astonishing richness.
19614	6	a	Pretty scenery. But Coppola should have waited until she could find a more charming leading man. 
19615	6	a	It definitely makes the viewer suffer--but it's debatable if by itself that's a truly enlightening contribution to one's understanding of Christ's message.
19616	1	a	A stunning, surprisingly credible marriage of acting, story, and effects.
19617	8	a	Lanie's professional success means she must be a failure at life, because she's driven by ambition and Doesn't Know How to Have Fun.
19618	2	a	One those exceptional sequels, even better than the original film, 'The Fast and the Furious.'
19619	1	a	Kudos to director Doug Liman for injecting textbook spy fare with slick intelligence and a truckload of tension.
19620	9	a	It is so bad that when it introduces a running gag involving blurred upskirt shots, you can almost hear the actors just out of camera range trying to get them to move the blurs up high enough to hide their faces as well
19621	6	a	The premise of Reign of Fire is an exciting one that, ultimately, does not translate into an exciting film.
19622	3	a	directed with pace and style by Peter Hyams and beautifully photographed by Richard Hannah
19623	6	a	It is not a very good film, but at least there is something going on here, most of the time.
19624	2	a	...several stories form a funny tapestry that is well woven by helmer Andy Tennant.
19625	0	a	Nolan has used the same illusionist's ruses to craft an entertainment whose power lies not behind the curtain but right in front of all the types of magic imaginable.
19626	4	a	Finally, a sit-on-the-edge-of-your-seat thriller that, though slightly by the numbers, made you jump on more than one occasion.
19627	4	a	Amiable if ragtag.
19628	3	a	Despite the glum subject, Coogan and Dench raise plenty of smiles as the unlikeliest of couples.
19629	4	a	The problem with the film is that it never quite finds that final spark of inspiration that might have made it worth seeing, let alone producing in the first place, and it is further hampered by some clunkiness in the storytelling department.
19630	4	a	Knocked Up is a good film. Lurking beneath the surface is a great one just dying to break free.
19631	3	a	...a striking piece of work, one that stays with the viewer long after the end credits have rolled.
19632	1	a	As a work of cinema, The Passion of the Christ possesses a majestic beauty within its horror, one that comes most effectively through a tiny, solitary teardrop.
19633	3	a	It's a little winner.
19634	3	a	The film feels like a download of Mr. Smith's brain.
19635	6	a	Your parents would likely love it.
19636	3	a	The movie is great. It is interesting without being heavy, smart without being pretentious and entertaining without being solicitous.
19637	1	a	[O]ne of the finest films about the life of an artist ever made.
19638	6	a	Lazenby makes the mistake of trying to imitate Connery rather than giving his own interpretation to the role, and as we all know, imitations just make us yearn for the genuine article.
19639	3	a	Tension-filled story showing how a diverse population can work together to save their lives.
19640	3	a	It's the perfect film for our age of reassessment and ambiguity.
19641	3	a	In a film such as this, one can only increase the layers of deception so much before they suffocate the basic story.
19642	1	a	Don't get distracted by all the quick talking, double-crosses or backstabbing. Just enjoy some of today's most talented masters of their craft doing what they do best in a film that will leave you feeling anything but ripped off once it's over.
19643	9	a	August doesn't make a lot of sense nor does it seem to have a message or point.
19644	5	a	Instead of tear-jerking, this approach eventually sees the audience dry-eyed with irritation.
19645	3	a	"Ralph Breaks the Internet"" looks great. But it's the script that gives it its heart."
19646	6	a	While by no means top-tier horror, it's nonetheless original and amusing.
19647	5	a	Predictable romcom will appeal most to adults. 
19648	1	a	The movie never makes fun of geek tropes, but it does indulge in rapid-fire pop culture allusions that go so bloody fast you need to see it twice to catch them all.
19649	4	a	anatomises a moment in time when smalltown idiocy suffers the most surreally awful repercussions of cause and effect.
19650	3	a	Uncommonly rousing entertainment that works an audience without pandering.
19651	3	a	Brilliantly bonkers, this animated Western weirdo should scare little kids while dazzling adults with its inspired approach to demented homage.
19652	2	a	A rather conventional romantic comedy, with the requisite plot devices to provide obstacles for the would-be lovers, but the story is well told.
19653	5	a	When a movie that you expected so little from delivers even less, you know it's bad,
19654	7	a	Tediously silly, slapstick re-visit with the rollicking rodents...
19655	4	a	There's also that nagging lack of substance that grows more frustrating as the movie lumbers along - a sense that this movie only exists because Disney had a slot to fill on its release schedule...
19656	3	a	Highly endearing even as it shows its age... filled with gorgeous shots and without a single wasted frame.
19657	4	a	So, yes, you should probably see No Country for Old Men, even if it does bow out with a baffling little coda featuring an old timer's meditation on the fact that he's estranged from his father.
19658	5	a	A watchable drama with likeable performances but it never quite comes together, thanks to an unfocussed screenplay that stumbles badly in the second half.
19659	4	a	Vampire satire has some creepy moments.
19660	0	a	This wondrous little fable is a cross between The Truman Show and Back to the Future -- and it's better than both.
19661	4	a	Fun, colourful and full of action, David Bowers' 'toon will have little trouble diverting those of a similar age to its perky, wide-eyed protagonist.
19662	3	a	"A pleasant enough comedy that doesn't take the ""gross out"" too far and presents a complex, if egotistical view of pregnancy and responsibility."
19663	4	a	Selma is one of so many well-meaning historical dramas that fall prey to their overpowering stories. Gravitas abounds in every scene.
19664	7	a	Like the overwrought lyrics of a classic country ballad, Country Strong is movie manipulation of the highest order
19665	3	a	This is De Mornay's film and she's a wicked treat, looking daggers at her enemy one moment and then glazing over with sweetness the next.
19666	7	a	A flat and clumsy paper-doll melodrama that even some gorgeous cinematography and a raft of gifted, great-looking actors can't save.
19667	0	a	[Sirk's] masterpiece, the grand-daddy of them all.
19668	6	a	Here is a modest little film that is about something.
19669	4	a	...the movie is mainly for the benefit of children, a good thing because the world will soon enough be in their hands.
19670	2	a	Whimsical, funny, violent, quirky and oh-so-cool.
19671	6	a	Worry not. I'm here to report Snakes On A Plane is a cheese crust pizza with double-cheese topping. It's so bad it's gouda. We're talking the kind of bad that inspires drinking games.
19672	2	a	That rare creation, an emotional film that actually takes the time to develop characters, although it goes a bit overboard in its third act.
19673	5	a	Gorgeous to look at but curiously uninvolving and occasionally irritating, this is ultimately something of a disappointment despite strong performances.
19674	0	a	"While their careers include fine performances, Benedict Cumberbatch and Keira Knightley are so ambitious, so subtle and so intelligent as the protagonists of ""The Imitation Game"" that their earlier work feels light."
19675	3	a	Tom Cruise gives one of his most intense performances, and the visual effects have enough high-tech power to make an army of interstellar invaders cringe.
19676	5	a	Barney looks both more real and more magical on video; on film, he's clearly a doofus in a felt outfit.
19677	3	a	Monster has the scary-but-safe feel of a dash in a Lexus through a bad neighborhood. 
19678	4	a	Exotic, escapist and superficially spiritual, it's shallow, indulgent female wish-fulfillment, sailing off into the sunset.
19679	6	a	As smart as it is, 'Pi' is awfully hard to watch. Filmed with hand-held cameras in splotchy black-and-white and crudely edited, it has the style and attitude of a no-budget midnight movie.
19680	4	a	Bening forgoes vanity and digs into the humiliation Grahame felt as she aged out of the vampy roles Hollywood typecast her in. Bell brings a sturdy humanity to Peter ...
19681	5	a	Dumb, unfocused movie that is neither comedy nor action-thriller. 
19682	9	a	Want to get rid of that guy who's driving you crazy? Drag him to this lame romantic comedy starring Kate Hudson and Matthew McConaughey.
19683	8	a	A picture that romances its audience into watching in a new way - by, paradoxically, asking us to watch in an old way. The Artist is perhaps the most modern movie imaginable right now.
19684	4	a	Pattinson impresses with a pared-down performance in an extremely pared down film. This is one of those Australian post apocalyptic road movies that keeps almost everything under its bonnet. 
19685	6	a	This is tragic young love in all its overwrought glory and agony. This is not the reserved, stylish sort of love one seen in Jane Austen's works.
19686	2	a	We're sitting around the storyteller as she tells us about her family and all their crazy personalities and relationships with each other. And we can smile knowingly because family dynamics are easily relatable.
19687	2	a	The pleasures of the film, as with La Dolce Vita, are experiential, and it's best received as a sensual rush, revealed through the eyes of a protagonist who has no control over it.
19688	2	a	Simultaneously rawly realistic and airbrushed.
19689	3	a	A spellbinding story of true love written and directed by Jane Campion that showcases Abbie Cornish as an accomplished actress.
19690	0	a	Every frame of this exquisite period romance features an attention to detail, a passion for literature and an intense, fully clothed, pre-Victorian sexiness that suggest a director in something close to rapture.
19691	2	a	This role proves Pattinson has serious acting chops. He's mesmerizing, as is Guy Pearce: always a versatile actor who nails every look, glance, and eye twitch.
19692	2	a	Despite its absurd storyline, it's a surprisingly entertaining film that won't deaden your brain cells even if it's a trashy B film sci-fier.
19693	3	a	A poetic and consistently surprising comedy-drama that is clearly a pet project for all its participants.
19694	2	a	A rousing good time that should entertain kids and adults alike.
19695	3	a	Blade Runner is a brilliant analysis of humankind, our development and evolution.
19696	6	a	Says to hell with subtlety--but with a pretty face.
19697	3	a	A fun Christmas tale.
19698	4	a	The ending will prove divisive but the dialogue sparkles, the atmosphere is brooding and Ethan Hawke chips in with the best performance of his career.
19699	0	a	So good you're not going to care whether his time machine works or not.
19700	5	a	Jolie has never been more Jolie, Depp has never been less Depp, and it adds up to nothing.
19701	4	a	Fun, but not a shade on the earlier Elm Street flicks
19702	9	a	While the director may have ambition to admire and career-risking courage to respect, the sad truth is his new movie has almost nothing to heart.
19703	4	a	My New Year's plea to Stiller? Watch Sideways. Rinse. Repeat.
19704	4	a	"In the end, ""The Infiltrator"" is as much of a poser as its hero. It wants to be a darker, edgier, more dangerous kind of film. But all it can really manage is a polite, careful imitation."
19705	3	a	Black Orpheus is a film to be drunk and luxuriated in, a sensational and rewarding feast for the ears and eyes. 
19706	4	a	"Babar: The Movie"" feels like a film in search of an audience. "
19707	2	a	I felt like I was Jason Bourne watching the movie, because I was one step ahead of it the entire way through...but even when Bourne is not at his best, he's still impressive.
19708	6	a	Not that anyone should confuse this with a good movie, but it features plenty of violence, plus Megan Fox in a corset. For action fans,that's entertainment.
19709	3	a	The script has some scuzzy, jokey appeal, and I like it that instead of trying to hide them, Herzog tosses the movie's ridiculous coincidences right in our faces as if daring us to duck.
19710	3	a	Hollywood has manufactured a number of coming of age films of varying quality, yet it's difficult to think of one that tops this powerful character study
19711	4	a	Without Crowe's laid-back approach and Damon's anchoring performance, We Bought a Zoo could have been a sappy disaster.
19712	2	a	[The film] places as much focus on a smart gender twist and sympathetic concerns about how the characters will progress.
19713	8	a	Let's talk turkey. There's nothing to be thankful about when it comes to Against the Ropes ... which passed its sell-by date even before the cameras started rolling.
19714	4	a	When you get right down to it, make-up and masks aren't nearly as scary as a human countenance hiding a black heart.
19715	4	a	Difret is a true story, that dives into the layer of polite social customs to expose a deeply set patriarchal system, which promotes hostile conditions for women in Ethiopia.
19716	4	a	It sticks to gimmicky scenes in which twentysomethings are dispatched in ingenious ways, but first-time director Steven Quayle delivers cheap fun that will keep fans happy.
19717	1	a	Both Linney and Hoffman are so specific in creating these characters that we see them as people, not elements in a plot.
19718	7	a	Goes on and on and on and on.
19719	2	a	Pitched uncomfortably but compellingly between homage and exploitation in its big-hearted exploration of the steamiest corners of black life.
19720	4	a	This is a silly, moderately funny fantasy fit for kids whose parents care about them too much to ever let them run around unsupervised at an airport.
19721	3	a	Not a great film like the original, but this remains a wildly entertaining sequel full of memorable death scenes.
19722	5	a	Not nearly as funny, clever or witty as one would have hoped.
19723	6	a	By relegating the story to a disappointing level of superficiality and never attempting to venture more than skin-deep into some intriguing themes, Bicentennial Man comes across like recycled, diluted Star Trek.
19724	2	a	... the sort of slovenly assembled, paint-by-numbers time waster that doesn't even seem able to hold the director's attention. 
19725	5	a	Cars-and-consumerism action flick has John Singleton behind the wheel but no Diesel in the tank, making for a lackluster blockbuster sequel.
19726	1	a	...begins on a high note and sustains it beautifully.
19727	3	a	The snappy dialogue and high-calibre acting, by the central characters and a strong supporting cast ... keeps the film from tipping over the brink into Showgirls territory.

19729	5	a	The movie loses some of its initial atmospheric tension as paranoid thrills give way to Rambo high jinks.

19731	9	a	Yes, it blows. Try to contain your surprise.
19732	0	a	Still a work of consummate artistry and craftsmanship.
19733	2	a	This is a bright and bouncy date movie with some sharp lines and even sharper performances, especially from Bates and Bradshaw.
19734	5	a	This is a sweet movie. It's so sweet, in fact, that it made me realize how cynical I've gotten over time.
19735	6	a	John Hancock is a black superhero desired and derided by crowds who are informed by spectacles, stereotypes, and fear.
19736	2	a	Sarcastic, frank and ultimately very funny, I Give It a Year most importantly understands the grating pitfalls of the romantic comedy and subverts them in more ways than one.
19737	3	a	The choice of Seth Rogen to topline this crimebusting bromedy proves an unlikely but ultimately shrewd one, plugging the void at the heart of the character with an outsize comic persona.
19738	3	a	Altman is one of very few directors who could have assembled such a superb ensemble, and he makes the most of it from first scene to last.
19739	4	a	"St. Trinian's is a hoot, but it's thrown-together, haphazard feel will only grate on the sensibilities of cineastes or aesthetic and moral prudes bent on decrying ""yoof"" culture -- although it's only moderately rude by contemporary standards."
19740	4	a	If you're going to poke fun at the already much-lampooned game of football, you need to be funnier, cleverer and more inventive than this. Sorry, Nick.
19741	4	a	It forces characters into situations that are silly without reason, and expects the premise to substantiate a lot of bizarre twists that seem to exist out of total conceit.
19742	7	a	The literary equivalent of Java script.
19743	4	a	As if trying to grab a lump of Play-Doh, the harder that Liman tries to squeeze his story, the more details slip out between his fingers.
19744	3	a	A Royal Night Out is a film of enormous charm, texture and good will, thanks largely to the three leads.
19745	6	a	Peter Jackson catches a nasty case of George Lucas-itis with his latest Middle earth saga.
19746	0	a	Brilliant.
19747	2	a	The Infiltrator is worth seeing for Cranston alone.
19748	4	a	Slick and sophisticated, if same-y.
19749	7	a	Quickly pushes aside the satirical promise of its premise in favor of trying to warm our hearts.
19750	6	a	Given the liberties the film takes, it's surprising that it refuses to penetrate Alan Turing's carnality and allow Benedict Cumberbatch to truly wrestle with the torment of the man's sexuality.
19751	7	a	The story of Stone, Skarlatos and Sadler is, as Hollande said, an inspiring one that deserved to be told. It's a story, though, that deserved to be told better than Eastwood manages to do.
19752	1	a	A total blast to watch, sustaining momentum with a sharp admiration for the thrilling highs and lows of the complex and its rich history with some of the biggest artists around.
19753	3	a	While gently spoofing the old Star Trek series and honoring it, Galaxy Quest creates and inhabits its own uniquely lovable universe.
19754	5	a	Freeman is great as Mandela, but picture loses focus and becomes a pretty lousy rugby movie.
19755	2	a	There's plenty to admire here, especially if your taste is tailored to the unusual.
19756	0	a	Addresses in a serious/comical undertone something dearly personal and subtle the director has to say that's worth paying attention to.
19757	0	a	one of the most devastatingly emotional films ever made
19758	4	a	There's a quaintness about the film, from the animation style to the wholesome jokes, that is refreshing for this pop-culture-obsessed animation era.
19759	8	a	There is truly nothing to enjoy about Texas Chainsaw Massacre: The Beginning, from its disappointingly unoriginal opening to the absurdly violent, equally disappointing cop-out ending.
19760	4	a	The musical numbers are what ultimately undo the movie.
19761	3	a	Russell Crowe as Maximus has the charismatic glower of a true star.
19762	2	a	An edgy thriller that delivers a surprising punch.
19763	0	a	Its effectiveness lies in the timing of shock moments that invariably threaten to make you laugh, despite the political incorrectness of it all.
19764	6	a	If you like splatter flicks, this is for you.
19765	4	a	the basic narrative is so convoluted and, in many ways, quite silly that the explanations end up looking strained and contrived and, ultimately, unsatisfactory
19766	2	a	full review in Greek
19767	1	a	Captures the spirit of the series while jumping ahead with some unyielding visions of the future which have just as much relevance today.
19768	4	a	Thanks to Geena, it's better than it reads on paper
19769	3	a	Features Antal's characteristic emphasis on his characters rather than the situations into which they're thrust.
19770	4	a	Early Man is technically-impressive and boasts strong visuals, but its simple story holds it back from reaching its full potential.
19771	6	a	A fairly dull, thoroughly mediocre adventure--hardly the cinematic treatment Marvel's first family deserves.
19772	5	a	never feels more than surface, more than flash.
19773	5	a	The sort of old-fashioned, slight little-guy-makes-good story that has some really charming moments but can often seem precious and contrived.
19774	6	a	"I Don't Know How She Does It"" doesn't know how to do what I think it's trying to do."
19775	3	a	The scenes between real-life friends Brady Jandreau and Lane Scott are the most haunting in the film because every moment, every glance, every unspoken word that collapses into a sigh feels intimate. 
19776	3	a	If you can handle its old-fashioned melodrama, you will find a beautifully shot, powerfully acted tale of loss, grief and the healing power of love.
19777	9	a	...an ordeal for the bulk of its hopelessly overlong running time...
19778	4	a	Knows how to be funny, but it can also be a bit too studiedly random, e.g. in generating Biaggio's vaguely creepy non sequiturs and in indulging long digressions about giant wontons and avocado meat.
19779	6	a	Based on Isaac Asimov's short story collection and directed by Alex Proyas, who did much better with 'Dark City' and 'The Crow.'
19780	2	a	This nifty little addition to the Winnie the Pooh franchise boasts some nice touches.
19781	3	a	A film with contemporary political resonance illustrated by a winning family story.
19782	6	a	"Palo Alto"" is something to watch and afterward say, ""Yes, high school is something like that, isn't it?"" That makes this film almost but not quite worth the investment."
19783	3	a	'Bolt' is consistently entertaining because its characters are so endearing.
19784	2	a	If the comedy didn't have its fair share of moments, it could easily be seen as failure; fortunately, a handful of game actors ... saves it as something that's mostly enjoyable.
19785	1	a	Assured and sharp, The Savages is only Jenkins' second feature-length film. You'd never know it.
19786	0	a	Director-screenwriter Sean Penn's gorgeous, compassionate film takes a generous approach to the story of McCandless, the real-life seeker who gave away his savings and belongings and walked into the Alaskan wilderness.
19787	2	a	Both less stodgy and more outrageous than the rest of the Russian silent film canon, Happiness is political cinema at its finest, and funniest.
19788	4	a	An almost nonstop parade of crude jokes, celebrity cameos and gurgling bong hits-but I can't say it's not funny, and some of it is downright hilarious. 
19789	3	a	Imagine if you will that a monstrous, CGI-sized jumbo python has squeezed together Airport and Alligator. What you'd then have is Snakes on a Plane.
19790	2	a	Jim Jarmusch's anthology of minor-key vignettes is a celebration of caffeine, nicotine and the indolent pleasure of sitting around and consuming them.
19791	3	a	Jurassic Park earns its spot in fantasy-film history.
19792	4	a	Looks better than the average historical drama; some top-notch performances, especially from Oyelowo; occasional moments of greatness
19793	5	a	Another unwanted, unneeded remake. The mind boggles that Dennis Quaid, delivering more corny lines, is stepping into the role of the legendary Jimmy Stewart.
19794	6	a	Stiller - by starring in Meet the Fockers, one of the year's final releases - pulls into a buzzer-beating tie with Jude Law as the most-overexposed actor of the movie year.

19798	10	a	about as terrifying as several pages of single-spaced programming code. Granted, that sort of thing can be daunting, but scary, not so much.
19799	2	a	"Lumpy, the ""heffalump,"" is a welcome addtion to the world of Pooh"
19800	6	a	The whole thing shambles when it should crackle.
19801	6	a	As paltry and unsubstantial a film as The Extra Man is, I cannot find it within myself to completely resist its charms. The reason can be summed up in two incandescent words: Kevin Kline.
19802	6	a	The movie seems better suited to a holiday release. While You Were Sleeping arrives at the peak of spring, the only season that can make Christmas seem like an unwelcome visitor.
19803	2	a	When it's in full throttle, there's not been and probably won't be a better action movie out there this summer.
19804	2	a	The new Bond thrills but falls short of greatness.
19805	6	a	Hanging out with Julia Roberts being all glowy and charming -- even when she's somewhat sad about whatever it is she's sad about -- is still kind of pleasurable.
19806	9	a	Gremlins meets Goonies meets something stultifyingly inept in a sci-fi adventure for the very young.
19807	1	a	One could use It's a Wonderful Life to teach their children values: compassion, selflessness, loyalty, and self-respect.
19808	3	a	A deeply funny, hard-R-rated comedy that doesn't leave you feeling like you need a shower afterward.
19809	5	a	Very little life here.
19810	3	a	Enchanted is worth seeing for Adams, and children will adore the slapstick performers, including a prominently featured CGI chipmunk.
19811	3	a	A stunning piece of popcorn cinema... one big budget blockbuster worth immersing yourself in ASAP.
19812	3	a	It's an imaginative take on leaving high school and its mysteries.
19813	5	a	It's interesting that Rob Schneider's comedies are getting progressively worse as they are released.
19814	3	a	It is a testament then to just how universally strong the acting is and how grand the set pieces Furman engineers that the film ends up mattering near as much as it does.
19815	2	a	A curiously tantalizing, melancholy meditation on mortality and the afterlife.
19816	3	a	It's a challenging picture, but it runs the gamut of emotions so well that it's nearly impossible to dislike.
19817	6	a	The Vanishing of Sidney Hall leaves little to the imagination and, by the end, a lot over which to be frustrated.
19818	9	a	Child-pandering and overly anthropomorphized, Arctic Tale is a blatant cash-grab by National Geographic Films.
19819	9	a	The camera-eye view is treated more as an obstacle to be overcome than a tool for storytelling, raising the question of why not just scrap it altogether.
19820	3	a	Ralph Breaks the Internet brilliantly satirizes the huge companies that dominate online life. A fall out of your chair funny subplot involves the Disney Princesses. 
19821	6	a	Into the Blue is just dumb fun in the sun. 
19822	9	a	A dog's dinner of a movie which not even the usually reliable Bill Murray can raise above the level of confused, cliched claptrap.
19823	4	a	It's a movie with all the warmth of a refrigerated meat locker at midnight. And who wants to hang around there?
19824	0	a	Ghost Dog is a wholly original creation made up of borrowed parts.
19825	1	a	Like in the Ocean films, Soderbergh's loaded A-list goes on and on.
19826	2	a	Oh, Chicken Run is a good movie, no doubt. It's also fairly entertaining. But Oscar caliber?
19827	6	a	The latest reason to shake your head and wonder why Jet Li is becoming the next Steven Seagal instead of the next Bruce Lee.
19828	1	a	Guadagnino has made the exploration of love and sexuality his mandate.
19829	5	a	It's got plenty of talented people working on it, but it seems like they all turned a blind eye to the fact that they were creating something truly terrible.
19830	3	a	A modern pulp adventure in the classic Spielberg and Lucas vein, John Carter is exactly what pointless entertainment should be but often isn't
19831	0	a	"The Brazilians have a word for the feeling Kore-eda evokes, saudade, a mixture of happiness and sadness, a love that remains once someone is gone. ""Our Little Sister"" is as close to perfect as a film can be."
19832	4	a	High school basketball is more than a game in this satisfying flick topped by Samuel L. Jackson's easy-to-watch lead performance.
19833	6	a	[Silent Hill] starts out a suffocating fog of creepiness wrapped around a memorably malevolent child spirit, but squanders its meticulously established atmosphere on a lengthy climactic sequence.
19834	2	a	An imaginative, intellectually stimulating feature-film.
19835	1	a	...it gives us a glimpse of what those silly people in black-and-white ... must have found so thrilling, engaging and ultimately heartening when they watched those quaint gray ghosts dancing on a screen they imagined was silver, so unrecoverably long ago.
19836	3	a	A fine adaptation of the novel. The kids' performances speak measures about human nature.
19837	3	a	As far as B-horror movies go with camp, and cheese, this is a good one...
19838	5	a	Fails to suss out Roth's biting Jewish angst and humor.
19839	2	a	McGuigan's artistic flourishes and Greenhalgh's observant script carry the audience through this story in ways that will spark memories even if the film doesn't have much subtext or weight.
19840	6	a	Nah.
19841	2	a	A moving and sensitive look at wounded masculinity in America's heartland...
19842	3	a	Cruel and unflinching, this movie is partially responsible for bringing Winchell's career down. Excellent cinematography, acting, dialogue, and scoring -- a must see.
19843	0	a	The best football movie ever made.
19844	4	a	Recent examples of slim premises that boasted strong and muscular cinematic style, not to mention a sly sense of humor Miami Vice generally lacks, were Cellular and Red Eye.
19845	3	a	Let the cynics scoff - this is a movie that's beautiful to look at that will leave you with some food for thought, as well. 
19846	3	a	The film goes where you expect, with the rather programmed feel of a 'classic' revisited with both money and zeal.
19847	3	a	It weaves games of dream and reality as the sextet wander through increasingly absurd set-ups. patriarchal authority and polite social rituals are slyly undermined, and the cast play it impeccably.
19848	2	a	This modest production scored with me.
19849	1	a	Allen in top form with Midnight in Paris.
19850	6	a	"The dialogue is truly painful. The situations are so contrived they make ""SpongeBob"" seem like a nature documentary. But what's more annoying about Minors, is the calculation behind it."
19851	3	a	...gimmicky but ultimately enjoyable...
19852	5	a	A monolithic sporting saga that seems content to pose on the podium, lulled by the belief that its subject matter provides inspiration enough.
19853	9	a	For what it's worth, Kate is Bradshaw in a blender: She still can't cook, but she's embraced the state of motherhood. 
19854	1	a	Not a single false note in this story of women's vulnerabilities, loneliness, seeking, disappointments, all brought about by the adoption conventions.
19855	4	a	The action moves credibly from Tampa to London and Paris, but anticlimax dogs the presumably factually accurate final act.
19856	5	a	the cinematic equivalent of a nice retirement facility
19857	4	a	"Destined to play second banana to last year's critical and commercial darling ""The Fault In Our Stars."" But as second bananas go, it's not a bad one."
19858	9	a	The last drop of charm was wrung out of this ensemble a couple of sequels ago. 
19859	5	a	If you want to hear characters talk to each other in Star Wars dialogue, I've got a couple of trilogies for you.
19860	3	a	An independent film that's all about forced independence.
19861	4	a	Knowing that you know the drill, Bandslam leaves out most too-explanatory details, and lets the kids be kidlike rather than movie-kidlike.
19862	3	a	Yeah Babeee.
19863	4	a	above-average, and much better than Seagal's later efforts
19864	6	a	"If you weren't among the diehard fans who went to see ""Snakes on a Plane"" at one of the late-night sneak peek screenings Thursday night, you missed the best reason to see this movie. "
19865	8	a	Hard to stomach...this handsomely appointed but turgid, dramatically inert movie simply bites off more than it can successfully chew.
19866	1	a	Linklater hasn't just crafted a detached portrait of a unique couple: he's painting a masterful examination of human nature, of that relationship we all want, but too often sadly see slip away.
19867	5	a	About the only good thing this movie can offer is some nice scenery, which I don't need to watch a movie over two-hours long to see.
19868	0	a	Garbo laughs ... and the rest of us revel in a comedy delight.
19869	5	a	"A scene in which an Escobar confidant happens upon Mazur and his wife enjoying an anniversary dinner...morphs into the most unnerving restaurant run-in since Joe Pesci asked Ray Liotta, ""What do you mean I'm funny?"" in Goodfellas."
19870	5	a	Just another self-absorbed teen chronicle, with the added twist of a little time travel and a surprise ending.
19871	4	a	For once, the following can be declared: the film is better than its trailer.
19872	1	a	The exciting second chapter in the Harry Potter chronicle that in many ways surpasses the original.
19873	6	a	Kate Winslet can do anything ... except save this movie from quirky overkill. 
19874	2	a	It's smarter and more purposeful than most teen flicks.
19875	3	a	...a B movie worth seeing, but there are times the weirdness seems forced and the only thing that feels authentic is the suggestion that Cage might be more than a little mad.
19876	0	a	Amadeus is simply one of the finest biographical dramas ever made.
19877	0	a	The drama between Teddy and his daddy is so rich and thick it's like watching a Greek Tragedy.
19878	4	a	The Imitation Game is a film about a human calculator which feels... a little too calculated.
19879	7	a	It's content to remain in sub-lowbrow land for the duration, except when it feels like imparting a lofty message it never earns.
19880	5	a	A workmanlike production that's simply too predictable and too preposterous to hold our interest.
19881	6	a	Silent Hill is not for lacking memorably nightmarish imagery, but the picture tries one's patience far more often than it unnerves it.
19882	3	a	Buoyed by the fine action scenes and the genuinely good script.
19883	2	a	It highlights a little-known historical event and gives the German Resistance the respect it deserves.
19884	3	a	Gibson's artistic intentions and interpretation of the gospels have created a film that is both moving and horrifying.
19885	3	a	Overall, Skyfall is an accomplished action movie which allows Bond a little more psychological complexity and stronger emotional beats. 
19886	3	a	No guns-blazing thriller, this is an old-fashioned code-cracking drama.
19887	4	a	Not perfect, but fans of the original won't be too disappointed, and there's still more laughs than in the vast majority of quickie comedy sequels. 
19888	3	a	... a savory sip of cognac in a Pabst Blue Ribbon summer of overbaked fantasy franchises and witless popcorn thrillers.
19889	4	a	Once you let the chaos of all the eccentric characters and the mystery Doc is trying to solve, wash over you, you start appreciating it, but if you question it and try to corral it, the film just slips away from you.
19890	3	a	It confronts the hard realities of a world in which few make it to maturity without their share of scars, and no one makes it out of adulthood alive.

19893	1	a	A study in the crushing effect of tragedy and the importance of empathy, it might be the year's best film.
19894	7	a	Von Donnersmarck's meat-and-potatoes direction makes The Tourist astonishingly lifeless and awkward, reducing two of the world's biggest movie stars to something akin to shy, pimply teenagers on their first date.
19895	3	a	It isn't perfect, especially as it comes near the end, but I'd say that this is a film that does everything it needed to do with a touch of beauty.
19896	3	a	A terrific thrill ride of a movie.
19897	2	a	The subtlety with which Mackintosh conveys her complicated mixture of vulnerability, defensiveness and pride makes [Kim] one of the most fully realized characters to be portrayed on the screen in a long time.

19899	3	a	All hail Tinto Brass doing Nazi Germany at its most debauched.

19901	3	a	For all its vagueness, the story is never less than visually exquisite ... and aurally appealing.
19902	3	a	A joyful ode to life.
19903	7	a	An ambitious failure.
19904	1	a	It's a lovely year end present. Near perfect, and damn entertaining with moments of thrills, triumph, and sadness...
19905	9	a	"Identity Thief"" is not only not funny. It's negative funny. It's short on laughs, but it will disturb and annoy."
19906	6	a	If you can settle for well-acted, glossy, fitfully riotous junk food with some questionable lapses in logic, The Cloverfield Paradox does the job well enough.
19907	6	a	Westfeldt takes a topic full of complex emotional shadings and turns it into something that is, for the most part, reductive, cliched and even sitcommy.
19908	1	a	The songs are all written and performed flawlessly by Bjork. And not only can the pixie goddess sing and dance, she can also act.
19909	6	a	The problem isn't that Rosie and Alex aren't charming; in fact, they're both thoroughly nice and endearing and attractive, so much so that I lost interest in them pretty quickly.
19910	3	a	Tom Cruise delivers.
19911	3	a	The story of how Nelson Mandela chose the white-supported national rugby team, the Springboks, to become a symbol of national reconciliation is uncharacteristically optimistic for Eastwood.
19912	4	a	Shults's chiller delivers jolts and jitters rather than splatter and critters. Indeed, this is the sort of horror film in which man's inner demons are just as terrifying as anything lurking in the darkness outside.
19913	4	a	It maintains its humor remarkably well, the gifted cast of superstars playing off one another with surprising ease. And, while the belly laughs of the first are noticeably absent, this one doesn't wear out its welcome quite as quickly as that one did.
19914	9	a	Instead of juicing it up with jokes, Brooks has inadvertently given us another story of the American condition, which is that of absolute and incorrigible self-centredness.
19915	3	a	Bloody, bone-chilling fun.
19916	0	a	Lost Ark holds up for many reasons, not least of which is because of Spielberg's consummate skill as a visual storyteller and his ability to draw charged performances from his actors.
19917	9	a	At the helm, Rinsch turns in a movie that's deadly serious yet entirely lifeless. 
19918	9	a	"The Tourist"" isn't a movie; it's scenery."
19919	2	a	For something as nasty as this it's a really fun film.
19920	3	a	This long and somber journey is nonetheless fascinating to watch thanks to the technology behind Brad Pitt's aging from old to young and visuals that contain a lasting power.
19921	4	a	A typically winning central turn from Kendrick and some Pitch Perfect staples just about save the day. 
19922	5	a	This actually isn't as bad as it could have been. That's not high praise.
19923	0	a	It allows Scarlett Johansson to arrive as an actress at the same time it finally gives Bill Murray the great role that has always eluded him.
19924	3	a	This Bill Murray is not only the most human, but in many ways the funniest.
19925	3	a	never a better villain than Bardem, blonde and mincing with a scathingly brilliant intellect at the service of a twisted, raging mother complex, and there has not been a better mother complex in film since Psycho

19927	5	a	dourly imagined tale whose only real value is in explaining the secret behind that pointy hairdo sported by our hero for all these years
19928	3	a	The only thing about the film of any lasting significance is Amy Adams, the bewitchingly good actress who plays the princess.
19929	1	a	The movie is a litany of victims and a chilling indictment.
19930	3	a	A very funny science fiction and Trekkie spoof.
19931	4	a	Whatever failings the film may have, none can be laid at the feet of lead actor Chadwick Boseman, whose performance is phenomenal.
19932	5	a	''Identity Thief'' strands these two ordinarily enjoyable comics in the middle of nowhere with no help for miles.
19933	3	a	Knocked Up really is the comedy of the year.
19934	5	a	A half-hearted, clunky stab at psychodrama.
19935	5	a	The action scenes move at a fair clip but this flawed film begs troubling questions.
19936	4	a	At the end we have a film that attacks its central issue from all sides and has a collision in the middle.
19937	1	a	A genuine laugh riot.
19938	2	a	"Giving new meaning to the expression ""upstairs/downstairs,"" 'Albert Nobbs' is a period piece about a cross-dressing, gay, single woman passing as a man and working as a butler in a posh Victorian-era Dublin hostelry."
19939	4	a	Despite...strangely misjudged moments, Love, Simon succeeds in navigating most of the pitfalls of the gay coming-of-age narrative and is ultimately moving and genuine.
19940	3	a	It is a pretty good, by the numbers, adventure yarn, but a raptor could write something more original.
19941	5	a	Scream Blacula Scream does better than Blacula at playing up Marshall's magisterial power, but gone is the tragedy that underpinned the original.
19942	4	a	As its title suggests, Tupac: Resurrection is less concerned with analyzing Shakur than with bringing him back to life, for which his fans can only be grateful. For everyone else, this film provides an affecting, partial portrait.
19943	0	a	The Coens have given us a film so unlike anything they've made before, and in doing so, they've given us a work of complete, devastating brilliance.
19944	6	a	The filmmakers use Woodstock as wallpaper for a hackneyed story of personal growth and reinvention.
19945	6	a	This is a lesbian romance told exclusively in the vocabulary of heterosexual Hollywood.
19946	3	a	Supremacy is, minor quibbles aside, a worthy successor to The Bourne Identity.
19947	6	a	Mooseport is one of those dreaded middle-of-the-road comedies. It's a friendly, nicety-nice, mock-funny, play-it-safe and use-all-the-cliche's-we-got style deal. Yech.
19948	5	a	[W]hen the canine protagonist of Bolt borrows a character arc from Buzz Lightyear, even youngsters will smell a rip-off.
19949	3	a	Ghostbusters is like romping through Disneyland's haunted house with Bill Murray.
19950	6	a	This film contains the stereotypical western adventure movie material.
19951	1	a	A tale of emotion somewhat dubiously sold as exploitation. What sounds like an uncomfortable tale of skanky, racially charged sex is instead a weirdly wonderful story about spirituality and sexuality.
19952	3	a	[Moore's] performance here as the deteriorating Alice is restrained and analytical in a way that allows us to see through her eyes.
19953	4	a	There are nods to how contemporary Scotland has changed, but Boyle's desire to intertwine then and now mostly puts commentary aside for a remix project that uses Trainspotting as a series of parts to be sampled for the sequel. 
19954	3	a	As stunning as it is, it also serves notice that House of Flying Daggers will have none of the complexities of Hero.
19955	4	a	The film is very depressing and melancholy that you have a hard time finding the entertainment factor. That is until you get the music.
19956	3	a	This is not dour social realism. It's a shot- from-a-cannon youth movie, with likable young people sticking needles in their arms in working-class Edinburgh.
19957	4	a	While there's an abundance of information and stories to be told, Sound City at times becomes almost as idle as its aging idols.
19958	4	a	I forgave its sins for delivering at least an hour of undiluted enjoyment.
19959	4	a	This is as rude, crude and occasionally quite funny as ever.
19960	6	a	A goofy, curious entertainment -- something of a guilty pleasure, a film that invites you to jeer and laugh in equal measure.
19961	6	a	Too fey, too coy, too precious...
19962	9	a	Even by the crude standards of teenage horror, Final Destination is dramatically flat.
19963	3	a	Solid Hitchcock espionage whirlwind.
19964	5	a	Constantly, the movie gives you the feeling of being drastically truncated, with hints of storylines that are never fully played out.
19965	3	a	Gleefully over the top - Ken Russell's last good movie.
19966	4	a	"Though it has bad word of mouth, ""Jonah Hex"" is generally better, sprier and more diverting than most of the action flicks now playing, The A-Team included."
19967	6	a	Only Craig's turn really leaves an impression, and you're left with the feeling that, for all its brio, Logan Lucky doesn't amount to a hill of beans, as they say in those parts.
19968	1	a	...had Wilmot not actually existed he could have been imagined by Jean Genet.
19969	4	a	Comic comfort food, ably brought off by Jemaine Clement and especially Elliott Gould
19970	2	a	The film is most interesting in its portrayal of Warhol as a cold-hearted user.
19971	1	a	You come out of the film shaking your head in disbelief at Father Oliver O'Grady, but fully enraged at Cardinal Rogery Mahony.
19972	6	a	Compared to While You Were Sleeping, even the half-baked scenario of the Marisa Tomei-Robert Downey Jr. romance Only You looks witty and inventive.
19973	3	a	With an entertaining nod to 'Sixteen Candles', 'The Edge of Seventeen' edges easily into Hughes territory. 
19974	4	a	If the Cuban Missile Crisis was America's premier postwar nail-biter, then Thirteen Days undersells it -- somehow, the filmmakers made it kinda dull.
19975	1	a	An excellent top notch gem with beautiful direction courtesy of Sofia Coppola...
19976	9	a	A dramatically inert and poorly acted French film.
19977	3	a	Logan Lucky is like those inline tube slides at a water park: you don't worry about where you're going, because getting there is so much darned fun.
19978	1	a	A wildly entertaining sci-fi comedy, a perfect cup of interstellar action-adventure eggnog to compliment the serious Yuletide films.
19979	1	a	Ciro Guerra's stunning and elegiac Embrace of the Serpent is at once a quiet lament and a subtle blast of umbrage in equal measure in its poetic study of white men's impact on earth.
19980	6	a	Details feel wrong; the pace is skittish; the rise to fatal hysteria is rapid and unconvincing. Finally you just lose all faith in it.
19981	2	a	Serenity, despite its simple chase plot and elegant narrative ductwork, is unmistakably a TV season's worth of roller-coastering drama, most of it balanced on the capable shoulders of Fillion, a natural leading man.
19982	1	a	What really makes it special, more than the impressive animation, is the endearing characters and involving plot.
19983	0	a	Bergman understands one of the most bittersweet characteristics of nostalgia: it juxtaposes our memories, in which everyone is young and healthy, and the inevitable reality of physical decline that followed. [Full review in Portuguese.]
19984	3	a	By the time we get to this Phoenix, it looks like numerous days of scorching sun and blasts of sand are pretty much good for the complexion. 
19985	3	a	Idealistic but not idealized, the film contains a bittersweet quality that suggests without spelling out how truly monumental, meaningful, and one-of-a-kind Woodstock was.
19986	3	a	A very impressive bit of storytelling and style that only steps wrongly in its final third.
19987	4	a	What a dumb, fun, curiously adolescent movie this is.
19988	5	a	As boring as a trip across Kansas on a Greyhound bus.
19989	9	a	A trite compendium of everything that's wrong with non-Pixar computer-animated feature films.
19990	3	a	Clockers uses unexpected narrative turns to accentuate the themes of lost innocence and uncultivated potential, and affirms that tragic melodrama is not a prerequisite for emotional impact.
19991	6	a	"[Some will] wonder how I could bash a story so ""touching,"" so ""humane,"" so ""heartwarming."" One word: manipulation."
19992	6	a	...altogether too nice, too neat and tidy, to really sell its message, but Sarah Jessica Parker is delightful here and there are enough relatable moments to give it a pass.
19993	4	a	Oddly targeted at younger viewers, many of whom may not have been the game's first crop of power players, this animated feature could prove to introduce them birds to a whole new generation. 
19994	1	a	It all adds up to a gorgeous, tone-perfect haunted house filled with immediate pleasures.
19995	3	a	The movie is a sci-fi buccaneer swashbuckler; Whedon hits all the obligatory space-opera notes, and he does it with a degree of verbal wit and agile pacing that could teach George Lucas a thing or two.
19996	2	a	Only in Hollywood would people make movies about how Diane Lane has trouble finding dates. 
19997	4	a	Sporadically tests one's sugar endurance, but there's no disputing its sincerity.
19998	1	a	Sometimes the old ways are the best. This is a theme and repeated line running throughout the new James Bond film Skyfall and never has it been more true.
19999	0	a	Visually and thematically, it's still one of the most beautiful films ever made.
20000	6	a	An amusing idea goes nowhere.
20001	2	a	Families may be pleasantly surprised to find this an often thrilling and imaginative ride for younger kids with a big helping of heart for parents.
20002	3	a	A bittersweet pill that's a mixture of an endearing family drama and modern romance that's an absolute delight. 
20003	3	a	A meticulous and thoughtful, beautifully realised and visually resplendent film that really gets under the skin of its central character and makes him a relatable figure.
20004	10	a	Funny this pot-headed comedy is not, man.
20005	4	a	Exciting B-film action-packed crime thriller, an early example of a disaster film.
20006	0	a	Beautifully shot, superbly written drama that exerts a powerful emotional grip and features terrific performances from a reunited Kate Winslet and Leonardo DiCaprio.
20007	4	a	Miami Vice is the last of the predicted summer blockbusters, and it delivers a reasonable amount of popcorn excitement.
20008	4	a	Vaughn/Favreau marriage comedy has lots of sex, drinking.
20009	3	a	Its privileged glimpse deep into unfamiliar spiritual territory has the strength of revelation.
20010	9	a	Saying it is a waste of time is an understatement of epic proportions.
20011	7	a	An endless slog of flat platitudes, generic cliches, and clumsily on-the-nose saccharine sweetness that feels about as sincere as a Hallmark card.
20012	2	a	Cast against type as the gentler of two musician junkies trying to burrow through the bureaucracy to enter a rehab clinic in Detroit, Shakur has the relaxed screen presence of a young Wesley Snipes and plays perfectly off the delirious Tim Roth.
20013	3	a	...an effective and surprisingly funny teen comedy.
20014	3	a	These Fitzgeralds are loud, selfish and often maddening, but they're a loving group, and you wouldn't mind spending more time with them.
20015	7	a	Sappy, insincere and really quite boring.
20016	3	a	Enormously entertaining and one of the most beautifully designed films you'll see all year, though it's not especially scary - opting instead for brooding atmosphere.
20017	1	a	Breathes vibrant, murderous life into a Western that's a welcome change from the usual group of guys wandering across the desert.
20018	3	a	Lost in a labyrinth of stomach-churning pugilism, the spectacle is a hefty cross for audiences to bear.
20019	6	a	Who would have thought that a real-life tale of sex, drugs and murder could be so instantly forgettable?
20020	3	a	Neither the life lesson on tolerance nor Carly Simon's treacly songs can weigh down the bouncy fun of this colorful and kid-friendly adventure.
20021	4	a	After a while, the jokes get desperate, but for a long time McDonagh's robust and emotional drama works, and McDormand is superb as the embattled but resourceful Mildred.
20022	3	a	If you love more recent Irish comedies, you might also want to catch this US-made, but thoroughly Irish charmer from yesteryear.
20023	6	a	You know how some movies just ring so utterly true that they defy your expectations and take a predictable genre to new and unexpected places? This is not one of those movies.
20024	9	a	Do fish have dreams? Do they dream of ominous iguanas, perhaps? Or maybe the disembodied breakdancing souls of freshly capped gangsters? More to the point, will Nicolas Cage ever make another movie that makes sense?
20025	3	a	There are minor conflicts and revelations, but these never seem like plot points. Rather they feel like the fabric of everyday life, observed with limpid simplicity and given powerful emotional effect with natural, easy, unforced performances.
20026	0	a	Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri is a wonder, a daring mix of tones and themes that always work concurrently rather than against each other.
20027	4	a	This is compellingly stupid and frequently hilarious, though you may want to bring a sick-bag, just in case.
20028	3	a	While McDonagh's dialogue is ripe and chewy, McDormand has the power to speak volumes in silence.
20029	4	a	It's certainly a far more nutritious experience than the book...and I certainly wouldn't begrudge anyone wanting to escape the depressing world we live in for a few hours to enjoy it.
20030	3	a	This movie packs an emotional wallop and women will get the most out of the way difficult decisions are reached in life-changing situations. Bening gives her best performance in years and makes a remarkable transformation that deserves Oscar consideration
20031	5	a	The film generates little tension or excitement, dawdling its way towards the climactic showdown between the heroes and the villain, Doctor Doom.
20032	2	a	boasts much of the humor, character development, story layering, and unmistakable heart Pixar has brought to the animation genre
20033	6	a	Among the best films adapted from videogames. Say no more.
20034	3	a	I think I need to see it again, again.
20035	4	a	Vin Diesel makes a bid for yet another franchise with a supernatural action romp that's both deeply ridiculous and enjoyably entertaining.
20036	9	a	"Bourne Supremacy's tag line, ""They Should Have Left Him Alone"" is so completely apropos for this particularly puzzling sequel."
20037	6	a	Why does this movie feel so tentative, so conflicted?
20038	3	a	Has the strengths of Spike Lee's best work without the preachiness and gimmicky camera moves of his weakest.
20039	9	a	In particular, as mentioned, the dance sequences are a mess, which is the kiss of death for a film in this genre.
20040	4	a	Is this the next Blazing Saddles? No. But there are enough silly laughs sprinkled throughout if you're into this brand of comedy.
20041	4	a	A hamstrung potboiler.
20042	5	a	if you're going to make a video game adaptation this boring, why not just call it Myst and be done with it?
20043	2	a	Winslet's performance, as well as Davis', anchors this rambling affair. The story zigs when you expect it to zag, but that is not a bad thing, especially when its characters are so engaging.
20044	9	a	Earnest, not particularly funny, and ultimately unforgivably sentimental. Somewhere along the way someone forgot humour.
20045	0	a	Two amazing performances cap a stellar work of musical imagination and creative artistry.
20046	3	a	Hits all the spots that most successful romantic comedies do, and has some decent laughs mixed in.
20047	3	a	At first Smith feels miscast, but he warms into the role. Good pace, nice robot effects, entertaining.
20048	3	a	Continues the director's streak of reliably elegant, original works, making the case, once again, that there are few other European directors working today who can match his particular blend of thought-provoking, artful, yet wholly accessible cinema.
20049	3	a	Although it doesn't hold up as much as you'd like it to, I liked its sense of scattered independence.
20050	5	a	The film is all too faithful to its un-cinematic source.
20051	2	a	... It's far from a lightweight, whimsical romp. 
20052	4	a	Director Malcolm D. Lee has a gift for finding gold nuggets of personality and comedy in the tailings of over-mined plots.
20053	0	a	Touching, warm, often funny and lushly photographed.
20054	2	a	A better-than-average horror release in terms of blood and general intensity, but still a pale shadow of its blasting-out-of-the-gate predecessor.
20055	2	a	Nothing here as inspired as the Lightsaber, but there's no Jar Jar Binks either. 
20056	2	a	Thank god Julianne Moore got an Oscar nod for her new film Still Alice.
20057	5	a	There's a crippling lack of emotional depth and honesty - it's hard to decide which is more stridently melodramatic, the bombast of the score or the shrill performances.
20058	1	a	This bizarrely funny satire/allegory from the maker of heavier fare such as In the Company of Men works on a surprising number of levels, not the least of which is perhaps the first human Renee Zellweger performance I have ever seen.
20059	3	a	A quietly harrowing chronicle of addiction and fragile recovery anchored by Vera Farmiga's intense performance.
20060	4	a	There's no depth to what you see on screen here: MacFarlane is simply doing what he does best; delivering cheap laughs as he continues to try and push the boundaries.
20061	5	a	I had hoped Generations would rescue Star Trek from its pervasive dullness, but somehow things have gotten even more boring
20062	4	a	Visually splendid, but anyone demanding more from a film than endless battles against overwhelming odds, fought by fellows who scamper through tree tops, is in for a letdown.
20063	3	a	The entire cast is game for the ridiculous, while Stan Winston's aliens and ILM visual effects give this the gloss of a straight-faced sci-fi spectacle. Beam on up.
20064	6	a	While the plot successfully sets up the subsequent confrontation between the fragmented Sam and Alexis, both actors fail to elevate their performances to the dramatic level the climactic scene requires.
20065	3	a	celebrates the timeless allure of the City of Light to the cinematic image without apology but it never goes as far as to overstate that allure
20066	4	a	...McConaughey goes for broke and turns this guy into an amalgam of every hard-nosed soldier previously committed to celluloid.
20067	3	a	It is a simple enough tale, but exquisitely acted, and directed with enormous style by Todd Haynes. You can almost smell the era; the cigarettes and the stultifying conservatism.
20068	9	a	The film is an exasperating bore.
20069	9	a	This time out, what's scary is how boring and unimaginative the series has become.
20070	2	a	What's silly about this is all the sex and nudity. And what's exciting about it is, right, all the sex and nudity.
20071	4	a	It's a boxing movie so you know where it's headed -- though in fairness it seems pretty true to Vinny's actual story, so whaddya gonna do.
20072	3	a	A movie for people who love the old Hammer Gothics precisely for their stately goofiness.
20073	5	a	Slick and erotic, it's not, but cheesy and tawdry are well within its level of accomplishments.
20074	6	a	Dreyfuss tries hard ... and almost saves the whole darn thing.
20075	4	a	The Predator delivers a good time without demanding that we think too hard about anything. But the fallout just goes to show how some of us don't think things through well enough.
20076	3	a	A powerful film.
20077	4	a	Its success is largely due to the casting of Amy Adams who is simply sensational. She weaves some serious movie magic into this thing.
20078	4	a	A Most Wanted Man is exactly what you'd expect from the director of The American, and while that assessment will mean different things to different people the film remains a meticulously crafted adaptation of John le Carre's bestselling novel.
20079	9	a	Gruesome gore is the sole highlight.
20080	6	a	Although it does stagger and groan and stumble around, you wouldn't necessarily say it's alive.
20081	0	a	Awesome documentary. Jackie reveals all. A joy to watch him work, especially when he gets mad.
20082	5	a	Lacking both will and budget, the filmmakers have done the honorable thing and given us a sweetly stupid, mercifully brisk bad movie.
20083	6	a	A silly slasher movie, minus the slasher.
20084	6	a	There's no real tension, because Kat and Nick are more surely fated than a pharaoh for his tomb.
20085	3	a	Cunning and surprisingly moving...may be burdened with an unwieldy title, but it advertises one of the year's most compelling films.
20086	5	a	"Jolie is gorgeous, but photographed in reverent profile, like a Roman coin. Depp is amusingly droll, but it turns out that ""mild"" for this great actor looks a lot like ""sleepy."
20087	4	a	A logical, emotionally resonant thriller.
20088	4	a	Total chick-flick -- but quite a bit better than it looks.
20089	6	a	I did like the performances, even though Blanchett was a bit stagey. However, with this paper thin storyline that is overly drawn out, I did not care about the fate of the two main characters and the whole thing left me emotionally cold.
20090	9	a	Without a single creative element. Put simply, it's one of the worst films of the year.
20091	1	a	Imagine, if you can, what Tennessee Williams might have written for a story line of TV's Mad Men and you'll get a good picture of Revolutionary Road.
20092	3	a	It should draw upscale adult audiences looking for a sophisticated romp to rescue them from the spring cinema doldrums.
20093	2	a	A style that works only with a sure hand.
20094	7	a	Given the intellectual level of this film and its lack of humor, it is not surprising that the ending rewards bad behavior. If you're smart, it's an ending you will never see.
20095	4	a	I party heartier than these generically attractive twentysomethings.
20096	2	a	This is the work of professionals acknowledging a good story and knowing better than to get in the way.
20097	3	a	Smith clearly has fun sending up his image.
20098	4	a	Has solid performances that make it moderately compelling, but its weak screenplay merely simmers the provocative, initially intriguing issues of racial prejudice, police corruption and unjust laws without bringing them to a palpable boil.
20099	5	a	The real crime here is the waste of comic talent.
20100	6	a	I laughed frequently, but the problem is that I'm not sure the director intended there to be as much humor in his film as I uncovered.
20101	5	a	This time out, there's not much out there to look at besides sand, and even it doesn't look real.
20102	4	a	Jake Schreier delivers a completely superficial film. [Full review in Spanish]
20103	3	a	Though it doesn't have the smarts of Shaun Of The Dead or the outlandish humour of Hot Fuzz, The World's End provides an explosive climax to the loosely-linked 'Three Flavours Cornetto' series.
20104	2	a	Was he always this way? Or is it just a reaction to so much sickness and death? The film doesn't say.
20105	0	a	Seems forever young.
20106	4	a	The film's portrayal of how religious fervour can interrupt the progress of secular knowledge is acute and welcome.
20107	9	a	Exacerbating matters is [Chevy] Chase's performance, which is incredibly obnoxious even by his standards.
20108	4	a	Eleanor Coppola's slight yet savory spree serves up sumptuously seductive cuisine.
20109	6	a	The clear irony of this genre is that it seeks to tell the story of a rebel in as conventional a way as possible.
20110	5	a	Half-serious and half-mocking, this film occupies a confused area where it isn't exactly sure what it is.
20111	9	a	The script, sighing, twittering and doing D.H. Lawrence lite, would be rejected as too whimsical by Mills and Boon.
20112	4	a	An oddly likeable film that grows on you if you're willing to stick with it. 
20113	9	a	Snakes was born dumb, but was then rendered ordinary.
20114	7	a	A Styrofoam heart and an embarrassingly juvenile worldview guide 'Love, Rosie,' the latest pit stop for rising stars Lily Collins and Sam Claflin.
20115	1	a	Soderbergh's most entertaining film, since at all times on the screen you can tell that the cast is having a great time. This is contagious and compensates many times for the slow development of the plot. [Full review in Spanish]
20116	3	a	great performances that will have the audience thoroughly entertained.
20117	5	a	A movie about depressed superheroes trying to become unsuper is as boring as it sounds.
20118	4	a	If you like Roberts and understand what it means to ''smile with your liver'', this is the film for you.
20119	6	a	Bullock, with her attractive but unglamorous image, gives humanity and a little bit of realism to an otherwise fairytale plot.
20120	5	a	If your idea of comedy is falling in doggie-doo or watching guys get stoned and foolish, you'll have a ball.
20121	3	a	The message is old hat by now, but I, Robot is a genuine Will Smith Movie. What more do you need?
20122	3	a	"[Blu-ray Review] Cheesy goodness in all the right ways. The ""Witchboard"" Blu-ray is worthy of an unequivocal recommendation. Buy it."
20123	6	a	This remake of a hugely successful Japanese horror film is very well acted by Naomi Watts. It's just not that scary.
20124	3	a	"He is ""sinking deeper into the guacamole of his own deception,"" says the owl who leads a Mexican mariachi band that serves as the story's Greek chorus - a description that shows you just how willfully weird are the goings-on. "
20125	6	a	A weak script makes for a wimpy movie.
20126	5	a	Like a TV interview with Heidi Montag, what you hear completely prevents your eyes from enjoying the experience.
20127	4	a	While it opens wonderfully, Whiskey Tango Foxtrot is never able to quite find solid footing. It has some great performances and moments that are both heartbreaking and/or humorous.
20128	6	a	In the end, the characters are all dressed up with nowhere funny or interesting to go.
20129	2	a	Putting the fun back into misanthrope
20130	4	a	Aside from the big hole named Chaney in the middle of the film, this is one of the most interesting ... entries in Universal's long-running series of monster movies.
20131	2	a	The studio's best-ever work with humanoid forms.
20132	4	a	This is Le Carre's world: the one where everyone is only somewhat knowable, and probably to some degree dangerous.
20133	9	a	If Hitchcock himself was alive today, he'd undoubtedly turn his nose up.
20134	9	a	Don't waste your time boarding this Flight.
20135	4	a	Week-old weed smoke practically wafts from the screen in a film that's most engaging once it's handed over to Justin Timberlake's excellent performance. But where it thinks it's delivering gut-punches, it's too often feigning with caricatures.
20136	3	a	Who knew that people could love their garbage so much that they grow angry when it is taken from them?
20137	4	a	A pleasingly average superhero movie whose greatest triumph is avoiding disaster.
20138	4	a	The lead performances are commendable, there's a genial chemistry between the three male friends and most of the jokes work.
20139	1	a	Devastating ... Heaven only knows why Deliver Us from Evil is only playing at a handful of theaters around the country. For one of the most important films of the year, it's shocking to discover that there's no room at the inn.
20140	6	a	[An] action film that will evaporate from the memory shortly after the end credits roll.
20141	9	a	Even the midnight-movie crowd would be hard-pressed to stay awake for the duration of this one.
20142	0	a	If Gibson's central wish was for people to discuss Jesus, mission accomplished. If you can manage to disregard the hype, you'll witness a wonderfully made film.
20143	1	a	"Looking at ""Early Man"" as a whole, it combines weirdly funny comedy with a sweet story about what it means to depend on others."
20144	2	a	Smith, coming off the madly audacious Dogma, knows that he's slumming this time and revels in it.
20145	6	a	At the end, the crowd applauded to signify their ironic appreciation for the imperishable pleasures of trash culture. Unfortunately, with Snakes on a Plane, there isn't much of a joke to be in on.
20146	3	a	A movie so bizarre, so profane and so quietly virtuous that it works.
20147	1	a	It is surely one of the most beautiful films in a long time.
20148	6	a	Essentially a dusk-till-dawn party film with a paper-thin plot and an open invitation to the audience to exult along.
20149	3	a	The Kings of Summer features some snazzy effects and an alt-rock soundtrack including some not overused slow-motion photography to illustrate Joe's murderous dream and several neat montages.
20150	3	a	Chappaquiddick is the best film to date directed by John Curran.
20151	4	a	The laughs come thick and fast in a sprightly kid pleaser full of slapstick set-pieces and memorable characters, while more grown-up viewers will find themselves grinning at pastiches of the Cold War paranoia of bygone sci-fi movies.
20152	3	a	If you loved Trainspotting first time around, you'll probably love this too. If you never saw it, you could start here and go backwards.
20153	3	a	It's a battle that's played out every day at recess in kids' imaginations: Who would win in a fight between Batman and Wolverine?
20154	3	a	The quartet of gifted actors can't possibly match their youthful charisma... but they can find deeper resonance in the characters' emotional lives, a sense of lessons learned and proper amends proffered.
20155	3	a	Low-key, wistful, and disarmingly droll...
20156	4	a	If you enjoyed version one, you'll find something to chuckle over this time as well, and it's good to see female characters treated with a little more respect.
20157	3	a	A weird double-bill in itself: Part one's a crime drama, part two vampire splatter flick. It's an awkward pairing, but there's fun to be had.
20158	1	a	For some, the silver linings in Russell's movies represent a failure to embrace darkness. I see them as a humanist's act of resistance. That's why American Hustle ranks with the year's best movies. It gets under your skin.
20159	3	a	What keeps Menashe from just being outside-in ethnography is how much nuance Weinstein and Lustig bring to the main character.
20160	3	a	"Boxing movies increasingly, over the years, show the fight game and in-the-ring action in realistic ways and ""Bleed for This"" is no exception."
20161	3	a	You keep pulling for The Infiltrator to break on through to something special, but it's largely an imitation of other, better movies.
20162	3	a	Keaton is given a rare opportunity here to remind us that she's not simply a fine comedienne, and she's marvelous.
20163	3	a	Putting a face on the incomprehensible figures, the film takes a look at some of the victims, middle-class professionals who bought into the dream of home ownership and lost everything.
20164	0	a	"It's hard to say how ""Veronica Mars"" will play to the uninitiated, but it's everything a fan could want."
20165	4	a	It's at its best when the bickersome Mr. Black and Ms. Blanchett trade insults about their begone heydays. 
20166	1	a	Sometimes, conspiracies are more than just theories.
20167	5	a	James and Mays are engaging and a handful of moments do generate genuine laughs. Not enough to justify a paid night at the movies...
20168	6	a	We view this event from every possible point of view except a logical -- or entertaining -- one.
20169	5	a	This curiously flat animated comedy simply doesn't have the sparkle one expects from a Jerry Seinfeld project.
20170	9	a	It's a plodding, episodic film, reverent and sanctimonious, and its pro-Southern viewpoint -- a time-honored Hollywood tendency -- makes Gone With the Wind look like a Northern polemic.
20171	3	a	I'd like to say there was a plot, only there isn't: it is simply a baroque and beautiful reflection of a five-decade romance with Rome.
20172	1	a	Director Clint Eastwood has mined more Oscar gold with his most profound work since 'Unforgiven.'
20173	3	a	Some of the gags do feel a bit repetitive but there are enough funny moments here for this film to stand out on its own.
20174	5	a	More creative energy has gone into furnishing these characters' apartments than devising credible emotional situations to put them in; the result is wholly undemanding, and best saved for a long-haul flight.
20175	6	a	Lions' iron whimsy is a jackhammer on the heart.
20176	5	a	While the animation is excellent, Astro Boy is too intense for younger kids, too corny for teens and annoyingly political overall.
20177	2	a	A study of mannerisms and relationships that pauses for the occasional philosophic sidebar.
20178	6	a	A dreary action-mystery that spends far too much time mucking around a villainous plot that isn't nearly as difficult to unravel as the protagonist makes it.
20179	8	a	The best Factory Girl can muster is Oliver Stone on a budget, complete with shrill overacting, sloppy pacing, constantly changing film stock, distracting celebrity cameos, messy psychodrama, and bleary stylistic overload.
20180	3	a	Of all the franchise flicks hitting theatres this summer, not one has a climactic battle as visually graceful, invigorating and altogether stunning as Step Up All In.
20181	3	a	"To put it gently, this makes ""Bad Santa"" look positively angelic."
20182	5	a	Starts off well but then tries to replicate the fast-paced frenzy of The Bourne Ultimatum with an improbable car chase.
20183	5	a	Finds a way to present a light-hearted sexual comic fairy tale, then derails itself with bad romantic comedy fallbacks.
20184	9	a	faulted scenes leave this decent and respectable story line nearly as overpowered and helpless as its own rape victim.
20185	3	a	This large-scale Disney family film is sheer delight.
20186	3	a	The movie is technically rough and its narrative is a bit wobbly. But because the story is so close to the lives of the actors, it has a unique emotional power that few films do.
20187	5	a	In this adaptation of Lisa Genova's novel, one is left wondering why anyone would want to be Alice to begin with.
20188	3	a	Surely this is not meant to be taken seriously?
20189	6	a	The hack novel by Michael Crichton did not inspire anyone to the level of Mark Twain's A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court.
20190	9	a	Wild Wild West has six screenwriters and between them they couldn't come up with one good idea or one decent line of dialogue.
20191	3	a	Jackson's presence alone raises Coach Carter above the formula it clings to. 
20192	7	a	Couples Retreat is an unending parade of offensive scenes, a tedious cavalcade of miserable, shallow people with whom we are no doubt supposed to identify but with whom we should hope to see nothing in common.
20193	4	a	Compared with Mann's other films, Miami Vice lacks the slam-bang set pieces of Heat and the human dynamic of Collateral.
20194	3	a	It's a small, offbeat, extremely well-crafted little film that's full of terrific touches. It's also the funniest mob comedy in years.
20195	1	a	Extraordinarily evolved documentary, proving it's ethically and emotionally devastating to monkey with nature.
20196	4	a	The end result is a decent adaptation that's clearly been designed to appeal solely to hardcore fans of the show...
20197	3	a	The first two-thirds of the movie felt rather special, while the last third less so. Still, it has its charms, the kids are appealing and it's worth catching.
20198	6	a	Writer/director Shane Black gives viewers a goofy, violent, R-rated b-movie that plays more like a parody of the film that inspired it.
20199	6	a	[Hoffman] sticks too close to the story?s stage roots, resulting in claustrophobic scenes and some trite plot complications that are uncovered in dialogue rather than action.
20200	1	a	Film fans who long for intellectual muscle have reason to hail Mr. Aronofsky for plunging into the mysteries of knowledge, power and the nature of God.
20201	1	a	Exemplary mixture of top-notch storytelling, visual razzle-dazzle, accessible humor, and involving action.
20202	3	a	Most films dealing with illness and carer relationships follow the same emotional paths and miss the same points. This film, by contrast, feels fresh and real even to those of us who have been there.
20203	3	a	With leads as winning as Cooper and Lawrence, and Russell's signature mix of clever and sincere dialogue, the hook is set.
20204	3	a	Padilha does much more than just present a hostage situation. He hunts down people who knew Nascimento and reconstructs his tortured life.
20205	6	a	Robin Williams turns in his smartest, funniest performance in at least a decade.
20206	3	a	From start to finish, even when you're not sure what's going on or what's being said, you're pulled deep into its vortex of sultry intrigue and unhinged ferocity.
20207	4	a	The air of paranoid mistrust rings true, evoked most eloquently by Hoffman's world-weary face, which speaks a universal language.
20208	3	a	It's hip, it's funny and it is one of the better ensemble efforts -- both in front and behind the camera. I had a fun time.
20209	4	a	A lively romantic comedy, grounded by John Cusack as an intense idealist with wit and a big heart, about the role of Internet match-making services in the dating game.
20210	3	a	If this role isn't remembered as THE signature moment when we came to think of Tina Fey as an award-level dramatic actor as well as an iconic comic force, it's a substantial step in that direction.
20211	4	a	Just a kinder, gentler teensploitation comedy, but Hartnett's Matt, at least, invites the audience to graduate to something better.
20212	3	a	...Academy-Award nominated performances might be reason enough to see Albert Nobbs
20213	5	a	[A] trifling melodrama...
20214	5	a	As ever Turturro is thoroughly watchable, but unfortunately, his cranky intensity is wasted on Watson.
20215	9	a	Jaws is looking a bit long in the tooth these days.
20216	3	a	People are feeling sorry for Matt Damon, but this isn't the embarrassing disaster you might fear.
20217	3	a	Like a proper action sequel, it's bigger, louder, and sillier than its predecessors, but it's more streamlined, too, smartly dumping the tired underground racing angle in favor of a crisp, hugely satisfying Ocean's Eleven-style heist movie. 
20218	5	a	The film is a letdown, alas, almost squandering all the fine acting and lovely scenery.
20219	6	a	It's all a bit of a mess really. Despite the likeability of the two stars - Lily Collins and Sam Claflin, whose mouth resembles Hugh Grant's - there is so much silliness in this film that I found it alienating. 
20220	1	a	a bizarre amalgam of source material, director and star that's just nutso enough to work
20221	5	a	The special effects are cheap and not at all impressive. For a series that relies heavily on sword fighting, it too is surprisingly second-rate.
20222	1	a	[Zhang] adopts a stylized but more naturalistic look for the visually sumptuous wuxia spectacle House of Flying Daggers.
20223	7	a	Intensely, aggressively, crudely, claustrophobically typical.
20224	6	a	"Even if you ""get"" what The Green Hornet is trying to do, it is never terribly enjoyable."
20225	6	a	There are a few cameos... there's product placement galore, a few bearable gags, a few songs and not much else. It's exactly what an Alvin and the Chipmunks movie aims to deliver, in other words.
20226	5	a	Bleed for This never registers as anything more than a boilerplate boxing drama, which is a shame because the material is all there, it's just hamstrung by a flimsy screenplay that refuses to let its characters exist on their own.
20227	5	a	Gridlock'd is a seemingly low budget film that covers the same ground as Trainspotting, but not as imaginatively.
20228	1	a	"It Comes At Night"" is a harrowing, horrifying effort told with brute conviction, a quivering meditation on grief and alienation haunts you to the brittle bone."
20229	3	a	"I hope Showalter never abandons the caustic, absurdist satire he's known for, but ""Hello My Name is Doris"" is an empathetic and satisfying step in a new direction for him."
20230	5	a	Jonah Hex is one big rush, but not in the positive sense.
20231	0	a	You are unlikely to see a better British film this year.
20232	5	a	Vacuous, elitist.
20233	4	a	An admittedly by-the-numbers affair, but garners some hearty and unexpected laughs through the machinations of its premise.
20234	5	a	Overlong and comedically uneven, A Million Ways to Die in the West spends far too much time treading water and nowhere near enough time being funny.
20235	3	a	Instead of pacing, it offers terrific performances and a wonderful sense of small-time tragedy
20236	9	a	"Favorite lines: ""Drop that zero and get with the hero ... You live your life for someone else -- you ain't livin' ..."
20237	6	a	You have two minor villains influencing the narrative, but is that enough? I would like to have seen more interaction between Spencer and Costner. Less of a judicial duel and more of a family feud.
20238	3	a	David Gallego's opalescent monochrome cinematography is simply breathtaking and only enhances an utterly magnetic experience.
20239	5	a	There might be a decent movie in here somewhere, if the focus had been on the right character.
20240	3	a	The Sandlot is just a fun, funny film that holds plenty of family appeal because it has a wholesome Norman Rockwell vibe and, as with any good sports film, you don't have to love the game to love the film.
20241	3	a	Another return to the ring for Rocky Balboa sees Stallone ditch drama for all-out adrenalin-fuelled entertainment.
20242	4	a	I found myself going with it for about two thirds of the time, seduced by its sweetness, suspicious of its sexuality ... occasionally exasperated by its incessant shaggy-doggedness.
20243	4	a	Though well-versed in the leftist movement in Japan, it failed to entice me to care about its problems.
20244	3	a	The performances of Caine and Duvall are a double-barreled blast.
20245	10	a	A smug, self-serving, charmless exercise in niche-marketed sentiment.
20246	4	a	Irresponsible, uncommercial but surprisingly watchable.
20247	5	a	It appears designed for families who never leave the mall.
20248	6	a	The script is kind of a bore and when it's not a bore it's dead set on simply being miserable for the sake of being miserable.
20249	6	a	Skimps on character development for such a politically-charged movie
20250	2	a	Does surprisingly few lurches as it walks the tightrope between urban realism ... and family entertainment.
20251	1	a	An artistic and narrative triumph and one of the most beautiful love stories set to screen in a very long time.
20252	6	a	It's derivative and tiresome with little more to offer than one might anticipate from a teen comedy road trip.
20253	1	a	Funny, sad, wildly unpredictable and shrewdly insightful, Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri is a movie that defiantly marches to the beat of its own drum.
20254	5	a	"Think the Cirque du Soleil performed by the cast from ""Saved By the Bell"" knee deep in diarrhea. It may be engrossing and even embarrassingly fun, but it's also just a big disgusting mess."
20255	2	a	A terrific, albeit dreary, character drama that directly addresses one of humanity's most enduring mysteries.
20256	5	a	Mother and Child is too dutiful, overly sincere and its impressions are easily washed away.
20257	4	a	It's full of laughs for adults but also has plenty of humor aimed at kids.
20258	4	a	[A]part from some undeniably slick effects ... the wow factor in this movie is surprisingly minute ... [O]nly Julian McMahon's nefarious psycho, Dr. Doom, shows real promise here.
20259	5	a	Must Love Dogs treats originality as if it were a disease, passing up almost every attempt to include the kind of ingredients that might take someone by surprise.
20260	3	a	Perfectly low budget and delightfully over acted. This is what B horror movies is all about.
20261	3	a	The movie is seriously sexy and seriously entertaining.
20262	7	a	What I witnessed was corporate greed: a savvy team zeroing in on an audience that goes gaga for the English costume drama, hoping to cash in on the popularity of young Hathaway after the enormous success of The Devil Wears Prada.
20263	9	a	Follow US audiences' lead - pitch your cinematic tent elsewhere.
20264	3	a	This is a pure bubblegum picture, but it works at that level.
20265	0	a	It ennobles the cinema. It says, yes, a movie can help us make small steps against our imperfections.
20266	6	a	Much is destroyed in Steven Spielberg's War of the Worlds, but the movie never quite delivers an emotional knockout blow.
20267	5	a	This film is basically one big Scooby Doo episode.
20268	5	a	A sappily-ever-after fairy tale.
20269	3	a	The movie walks the line between good stupid humor and embarrassing stupid humor, and usually manages to stay on the good side.
20270	6	a	A merely acceptable adaptation that feels more like a supernatural thriller with a couple of references to the game, involuntarily funny dialogue, and decent performances, than a terrifying production. [Full review in Spanish]
20271	0	a	The Coens have returned... full of talent. [Full review in Spanish]
20272	0	a	This may very well be one of the most powerful movies ever made about the misfortune of growing old and fragile.
20273	3	a	The second Addams flick is actually funny, too. And obviously that goes a long way.
20274	3	a	It may be predictable, but Bleed For This still grabs with its astonishing against-all-odds true story, and its belter of a central performance from Miles Teller.
20275	0	a	"Vertigo"" is Alfred Hitchcock's beautifully stylized psychological thriller about a man in love with a fetishized romantic fantasy invented by another man."
20276	5	a	Captures the brash boldness of the novel, but not the literary wit. A misguided affair.
20277	5	a	Even considered entirely separately from its source material, American Pastoral is hopelessly weak.
20278	4	a	Even though you can't figure out what anyone is saying, the story is so straightforward and mindless that you gradually figure out what's going on, and the style is so fluid -- and the Caribbean visuals so evocative -- that you're carried right along.
20279	3	a	Friedkin takes what could have been a case study in trailer-trash miserabilism and produces something riveting, compassionate, and truly singular.
20280	7	a	It's always a bad sign in a thriller when the big reveal is greeted by hoots of derisive laughter.
20281	8	a	Alpha Dog's characters adopt poses that they've seen on television and in the movies, and the same goes for the young cast hamming it up as if they watched their Scarface DVDs too many times in preparation.
20282	4	a	...may wander near and far, mixing down-home hokum with gushy sentiment, yet it generally succeeds in winning us over.
20283	4	a	Even if you know what's coming, it's a neat bit of meta-thriller filmmaking, as much about the mechanics of storytelling as a reasonably satisfying example of it.
20284	3	a	Those seeking something a little more off the beaten path than The Natural or Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid should check out this entertaining caper yarn.
20285	3	a	An effectively creepy and at times gut-wrenching take on the pandemic genre.
20286	2	a	Tina Fey shines in her delicately balanced role of journalist. Kim Baker, moving seamless between comedy and drama. 
20287	4	a	Enchanted? You will be.
20288	9	a	An excruciatingly contrived, bland and asinine romantic comedy that lacks both romance and comedy. You'd be more entertained watching paint dry. 
20289	4	a	Of all the many films about Jesse James, Andrew Dominik's epic may not end up ranking as the most popular or the best film on the subject but it will certainly, flaws and all, be regarded as the most intriguing and ambitious take on the man and his myth.
20290	10	a	I suppose certain college fraternities could make screening it part of their hazing rituals.
20291	4	a	Running close to four hours, including intermission, this landmark epic of the Civil War is, basically, a television mini-series released as a feature film.
20292	4	a	Mark Felt still struggles to create enough of a genuine sense of suspense to keep the audience on edge. 
20293	4	a	One of those based-on-truth stories that persuades you, with every scene, that it could never really have happened this way.
20294	9	a	A movie that is cheerfully, indiscriminately violent, exploiting exactly the same viciously cyclical culture on which it pretends to be providing trenchant commentary.
20295	6	a	Cage, who usually goes gonzo with gusto, underplays this monster. That spoils the fun.
20296	5	a	Brooks never supplies a definitive answer to the open-ended title, but I think most everybody would agree you just know when it's right. And in the case of How Do You Know, when it's not.
20297	1	a	Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets surpasses Sorcerer's Stone as a crisper, more action-packed film, which will more than thrill the billions of Harry Potter fans everywhere.
20298	3	a	A fascinating account, if less urgently compelling than it might have been.
20299	2	a	Like Hitchcock, nothing is thrown in without serving a purpose.
20300	3	a	The Night They Raided Minsky's is being promoted as some sort of laff-a-minit, slapstick extravaganza, but it isn't. It has the courage to try for more than that and just about succeeds.
20301	4	a	Brooks is back with another warm, smart romance along the lines of As Good As It Gets. The snappy characters are well-played by a strong cast, which makes it steadily entertaining even if it's not hugely believable.
20302	6	a	One of the better entries in the series. That's not to say it isn't big and dumb, only that its big dumbness is executed with some degree of competence.
20303	3	a	In Tamara Jenkins' brutally frank and occasionally funny look at lives shaped by disappointment and fear, their love for each other binds them through the worst of times.
20304	1	a	The Grey Zone gives life and meaning to an event that is little more than a footnote in history books.
20305	4	a	The overgenerous running time is somewhat to the film's advantage, but there are warning signs that Jackson might be stretching the tale to its limit.
20306	5	a	The new Robin Williams comedy Man of the Year is the sort of thing you almost feel sorry for.
20307	4	a	muddled but fascinating
20308	4	a	[Carter's] selfless actions against a failed education system register even when the movie surrounding him turns on itself.
20309	4	a	...Jackass is certainly one of the funniest moviesof the year...
20310	2	a	Call Me by Your Name is a stronger film than the director's last film, A Bigger Splash, and employs touches of pure emotion that will tug at your heart. 
20311	4	a	The laughs come a decent enough clip, but McFarlane's satirical sights are slightly off. He could've aimed a little higher a little more often.
20312	3	a	First-time director Patty Jenkins takes us inside a year in Wuornos' turbulent life, building her movie around Theron's dynamite performance, raw, exposed and nerve-wracking in its immediacy.
20313	0	a	Down to the Bone achieves what only the best independent films have: making life, at its most unvarnished, a journey.
20314	6	a	The film looks muddy, fuzzy and indistinct.
20315	2	a	It's all very seductive.
20316	3	a	It's a quietly harrowing portrait of a family losing the woman they know -- and a woman losing herself.
20317	4	a	What's wrong with Memoirs of a Geisha' isn't the casting; it's the film's languorous pace.
20318	3	a	An intelligent crowd-pleaser anchored by an Oscar-worthy performance from Freeman and directed with invigorating gusto by one of our top film pros.
20319	7	a	When Jimmy Smits holds out his hand, suddenly Karen's lifelong fury evaporates, transforming her into the loveliest woman ever known to man. What? All this time, and all she needed was the touch of Smits' mitts?
20320	1	a	Schrader pulls no spiritual punches.
20321	3	a	Killer Joe's scenes are long and dialogue is of a high quality; by turns funny and absurd, yet also desperately sad.
20322	5	a	If the film is smarter and more ambitious than I expected, it is also less involving: a meandering, digressive plea for a social conscience that never finds a rhythm or a pulse.
20323	5	a	You go into a movie like The Tourist hoping for a feast of personality from the stars. What you get, in this case, is a waxworks version of chemistry.
20324	9	a	This histrionic portrait of the most celebrated cur in sports history comes across like a fly ball that thuds on the ground.
20325	4	a	Except for the Mozart music and Tharp movements around the edges, Amadeus plays like a monument to mediocrity.
20326	8	a	With a stacked cast, and sharp scripting and direction from Russell, American Hustle makes for a highly entertaining guide on how to fake it in America
20327	3	a	The film seduces. Beautifully produced, from production design and costumes to music and performances, it's also faithful to the genteel spirit and repressed passions for which she's known.
20328	3	a	A voyage of discovery that's generally absorbing and sometimes breathtaking, though some of the directorial choices are unnecessarily glitzy.
20329	3	a	This is very light material, and, unusually for a Lee picture, not everybody in the ensemble appears to be acting in the same universe, let alone the same story. On the other hand: It's fun.
20330	3	a	Paranormal fun for tweens and up; some scares.
20331	6	a	A phoenix may rise from the ashes, but the movie just crashes and burns.
20332	0	a	Sometimes cinema should just be pure, unadulterated joy, and The Artist is precisely that, in every wordless frame.
20333	6	a	This impeccably crafted Gothic horror tale... doesn't quite come to fruition despite some vivid elements.
20334	7	a	Arguably the best segment in Four Rooms is the one with the little kids left alone in the room by their dad. I trust Rodriguez with kids as a subject. I liked it.
20335	3	a	"Not as record setting a motion picture as, say, ""Titanic,"" but more haunting and ethereal."
20336	4	a	Rooney Mara isn't quite as in-your-face as Noomi Rapace was playing Lisbeth in the Swedish films, yet she is both tough and sensitive...
20337	6	a	So long as they're driving it's fine, but whenever they stop to open their mouths, it grinds to a halt.
20338	3	a	This lavish production of Tarzan creator Edgar Rice Burrough's space adventure has much to recommend it.
20339	8	a	This film just made me want to crawl up into a ball and cry. And I pretty much did. Not because the film is sad or anything; just because it is that unbelievably putrid.
20340	1	a	Francois Truffaut's testimony of obsession, The Green Room, is perhaps the most unheralded film of his career, and surely one of his most personal.
20341	5	a	click for full review
20342	3	a	This first-rate teen comedy brilliantly captures the turbulence of adolescence thanks to writer-director Kelly Fremon Craig's smartly funny script and to Steinfeld's terrific lead performance.
20343	0	a	Some of the most disturbing things you've ever seen in a horror film . . . should you have a problem with sleeping too well at night, try watching this movie a few times
20344	3	a	A compelling portrait of a particularly tumultuous time in American history and how the media of the day adapted to and helped foster the many changes that were going on.
20345	5	a	Unlike the bear of very little brain, this is a film pulled in different directions with entirely too many thoughts in its head.
20346	5	a	the movie is its own worst enemy
20347	9	a	Leave this one as history has intended: unknown, forgotten, and detested by the unfortunate few who've actually seen it.
20348	6	a	A simple movie of straightforward sentimentalism and gung-ho, against-all-odds inspiration.
20349	3	a	Wildly entertaining.
20350	1	a	The film is sex and soul in equal measures; sensationalism and bad taste harnessed for noble purpose.
20351	6	a	The PG rating for Unaccompanied Minors doesn't stand for Pretty Good.
20352	5	a	Some cute animal moments, but the flat human characters do not ring true.
20353	9	a	there are most things more terrifying than slugs
20354	9	a	Glossy and gutted, Jonah Hex turns the cowboy with a melted mouth into a grunting moviegoing chore. But at least it's a ridiculously short chore. 
20355	5	a	[Laura Linney] shines out of this unappealing murk like a sunflower planted in a coal mine.
20356	0	a	Even a longer Amadeus feels and looks just right.
20357	1	a	This sharply observed madcap comedy, about a marriage of convenience between a gay Taiwanese American and a Chinese woman, examines the primacy of the individual within a culture that worships authority and rewards conformity.
20358	3	a	What looks like a raucous frat-boy comedy is really a surprisingly canny depiction of a stagnant relationship.
20359	3	a	The Imitation Game is a gripping and satisfying film which occupies dual genres, featuring a stunning performance from Cumberbatch. Another one to watch on Oscar night, for sure.
20360	4	a	both leads are at the top of their game in a story that normally brings out the worst in actors of this caliber
20361	3	a	As always, Eastwood brings solid craftsmanship to the proceedings, with direction that allows the actors to breathe while remaining alert to small details that speak of greater wisdom.
20362	3	a	Put on your outrage cap.
20363	4	a	An inspirational film about a high school coach who has the gall to suggest that athletes must make their mark in the classroom as well as on the basketball court. 
20364	7	a	Elite Squad can't decide whether it wants to pull the lid back on what urban decay has wrought or simply open up a can of whup ass.
20365	4	a	A triumph of style over substance, Mann's noirish crime drama is B-level narrative wrapped in a visually sumptuous and viscerally thrilling package.
20366	6	a	My main problem with Fight Club is that its mood and screenplay suggest an important film with something socially significant to say when in reality it's paper-thin stuff.
20367	4	a	No Country for Old Men is the kind of film that will only cement the opinion you already have about its uniquely eccentric makers. Approach the ticket booth accordingly.
20368	3	a	Fincher's The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo manages to build on the original film without copying it, reinventing it or ignoring it.
20369	1	a	A fun-filled film.
20370	2	a	An elegiac, ruminative modern western about a young South Dakota rodeo rider who must decide what choices to make after suffering a serious head injury. 
20371	4	a	Most Disney flicks work on an adult level; I don't feel like I need a kid to lug into the theatre with me. This time, I felt like I needed a kid.
20372	9	a	The only shocking thing about it is how dull and predictable the whole enterprise is.
20373	10	a	"That the film even tries to be heartfelt is egregious in itself, but ""good luck"" finding it among the horrendously executed slapstick, equally disastrous gross-out humor, and so much blatant racism, homophobia, and scorn for everyone else."
20374	1	a	Blade Runner, which does not look one bit dated, envelops us so completely in its off-kilter, near-future world.
20375	3	a	The title sequence alone is the single coolest thing you will see at the movies all year.
20376	8	a	This film has no idea what tone it wants to strike... none of the more sincere messages land because the film's depiction of its middle eastern characters is grossly one note.
20377	9	a	A mundane car wreck with a few promising scenes that lead absolutely nowhere.
20378	1	a	"To paraphase a critic, ""At a time that so-called major directors are producing anemic works of little interest, 'Killer Joe' is a source of optimism."
20379	3	a	Christopher Robin is one fun escapist movie that will tug on your nostalgia heartstrings. 
20380	4	a	An oddity, not without charm.
20381	5	a	Tolkien could invent names and languages, but he couldn't create a plot at gunpoint. 
20382	5	a	It's an impressive bit of slumming by some name actors revisiting a childhood favorite -- a bit as if Hollywood had somehow convinced William Hurt to help restart Lost in Space, or Robert De Niro to do a Bullwinkle movie. Oh, wait.
20383	4	a	This is watchable enough as a grisly revenge thriller but it would have worked better without the Lecter connection.
20384	0	a	The joy of this movie is how Craig breathes new life into a cinematically commonplace narrative.
20385	0	a	It's an incomparably lovely period romance, as warm and therapeutic as the sunlight that suffuses every frame.
20386	3	a	All the performances are dryly on point.
20387	5	a	This third film is easily the weakest of the bunch, but I can't say it's terrible.
20388	9	a	Predigested drivel.
20389	0	a	The Coen brothers' best movie, hands down, is a chase film in which all the characters scatter their essences as they run.
20390	4	a	A screeching, testosterone-propelled fifth installment for this durable, high-octane franchise.
20391	5	a	Occasional flair and an A-list cast are simply not enough to carry this erratic origins story.
20392	3	a	The best summer thrill ride since Batman Begins, Serenity roars in a late but mighty welcome considering this year's sub-fun slate.
20393	0	a	The best praise I can give First Reformed is that it makes powerful people feel uncomfortable.
20394	6	a	Koepp simply never gets anywhere near the story's underlying themes.
20395	4	a	"Patience Required to Appreciate Anderson's ""Vice."
20396	2	a	When Black employs a tactic and sticks with his brains - like an evolving predator - he can't be stopped.
20397	4	a	A slick yet pedestrian thriller.
20398	5	a	Tepid. The idea is so much better than the execution.
20399	6	a	Roberts can still dazzle with a smile, and Hanks is the dad/chum/neighbor we all wish we had, but that's not enough on which to build an entire film, not even a small one.
20400	0	a	The latest James Bond adventure proves, at least in my opinion, that Craig has grasped the role better than any of his predecessors, including Sean Connery.
20401	6	a	When the video game-to-movie thing becomes this literal, it only makes you wonder why anyone would want to see a big-screen Doom at all.
20402	6	a	As effective as director Josie Rourke is at exposing the emotional and physical toll of reigning as queen when exploring Mary and Elizabeth's relationship, her portrait of an endless string of betrayals ends up as simply faceless and impersonal. 
20403	7	a	The Break-Up can't work because it denies its protagonist his humanity, and us the pleasure of watching human characters do at least vaguely human things.
20404	5	a	The whole film is a rip off of the original Alien film.
20405	9	a	They surf in the first half and ninja in the second, but this light comedy adventure never really takes off.
20406	4	a	Even though I love a good family film now and then, this was too much even for me. It was like having a root canal of cream filling.
20407	2	a	Fart jokes are all too plentiful, along with copious references to bodily fluids, but in this zany context the film gets away with them. And the screenplay is crammed with witty lines. The western lives on.
20408	3	a	"Conviction propels ""Oceans."
20409	4	a	The opening credits sequence is so long and puzzling -- it's not obvious what we're supposed to be looking at -- that it sets a bad tone for the rest of the picture.
20410	6	a	With no baseline 'truth' to be found among the cartoony characters and cheesy twists, the whole production feels like a Texas-size load of secondhand lyin'.
20411	7	a	Yes Cosmopolis bears a striking gloss, and is shot basically well, but it is way too showy without the necessary substance, and as a result feels fatally hollow.
20412	1	a	"Hereafter"" asks several questions and wisely does not offer any answers. Those, the director and screenwriter leave to the viewer."
20413	2	a	It's nothing special, but it's tastefully macabre in that cozy October way and only has a few poop jokes.
20414	6	a	Cheers to Christina Ricci, but I hope her contract doesn't demand another sequel. She deserves better.
20415	3	a	A Most Wanted Man is a rare feature: a relatively smart take on the war on terror that doesn't devolve into ideological score settling.
20416	4	a	If it had the unwavering focus and clear-eyed vision of Russell's previous two features, I Heart Huckabees might have been brilliant.
20417	2	a	The movie is an undeniable good time. But don't expect any of it to hold together.
20418	4	a	The first feature film by Bilge Ebiri, a New York Magazine film critic, is an unusual hybrid, a surreal 'cubicle comedy' that subtly morphs into a paranoid thriller.
20419	4	a	You don't have to be Greek to enjoy My Big Fat Greek Wedding, and that's precisely the point of it.
20420	5	a	Way too much draggin' and not nearly enough dragon, this overly serious talkathon is the perfect cure for insomnia, but little else.
20421	5	a	the best scenes of the movie are unrelated to the overall plot and involve the supporting cast... If only the movie was about them instead.
20422	3	a	A buoyant, extremely enjoyable film that coasts along on a quality few movies manage to capture: the exuberant curiosity of youth.
20423	1	a	Aniston has at last decisively broken with her Friends image in an independent film of satiric fire and emotional turmoil.
20424	6	a	The whole thing feels so by-the-numbers that it's hard to get too invested in the proceedings.
20425	3	a	The finale, when [Philip Seymour Hoffman] reacts to everything that has gone before, is the year's most remarkably cinematic moment.
20426	1	a	You'll probably think in a new way about the sounds and the music, the look of places and people, how much or little you take note of the scents and sensations of daily life.
20427	6	a	It seems that Lee and Schamus had no idea what it was they wanted to say here. Did Woodstock matter? Does anyone care?
20428	9	a	A movie that is glamorous and handsome, but no more so than a six-page Vanity Fair fashion spread shot on location on the canals of Venice and starring these two overqualified model/stars.
20429	4	a	Better than the book.
20430	1	a	Singer has a masterful touch with composition, creating tension simply by the way he places his actors around a room. And even though we know how it turned out, the assassination plot remains a gripping tale.
20431	1	a	Jindabyne is an eventful movie, but director Ray Lawrence gives the events a simple, plainspoken quality.
20432	0	a	For all the action, it's the human element that elevates House of Flying Daggers to lofty heights.
20433	3	a	A searing, powerful look at the mingling of faith, politics, and activism
20434	2	a	Between the artful direction and incisive script, there's plenty of wit and romance and never a whiff of sentimentality. And while it never feels particularly deep, the movie is packed with points of resonance that linger in the mind afterwards.
20435	0	a	Penn's direction is amazingly sharp and intuitive, full of masterful touches that give an epic dimension and scope to the parable.
20436	4	a	Is Monster about Wuornos' transformation into a serial killer, or Theron's transformation into Wuornos?
20437	6	a	He's just another cheap icon, set not to haunt our worst nightmares, but the cash-cow dreams of a studio looking for a franchise player.
20438	6	a	...Jane just comes off as a stereotypical background female character that somehow managed to find her way into the spotlight.
20439	5	a	The writing and directing continually treat the audience like idiots.
20440	2	a	The ending does teach a predictably sweet message, but it's the journey that's more than half the fun in this appealing movie perfect for a winter break afternoon.
20441	6	a	Too much of the film is taken up by creaky plot devices and one sibling vowing to track down and talk to another one to resolve a problem.
20442	5	a	A Royal waste.
20443	1	a	A haunting and meditative work.
20444	5	a	A complete trainwreck from beginning to end. It spits on the Predator's franchise and plays like a comedy rather than a legit Predator follow-up with a story so convoluted and characters so weak to the point where the film was unbearable to watch.
20445	2	a	The characters may not move with the fluidity of their American counterparts, but the story unfolds with a sinister grace that any live-action director might envy.
20446	6	a	...Country Strong's downfall stems from its almost egregiously deliberate pace...
20447	3	a	Strong performances and a genuinely remarkable real-life tale help Ben Younger's boxing drama Bleed For This rise above the similarities it undoubtedly shares with other films in the genre.
20448	3	a	A good old-fashioned space opera.
20449	4	a	An puzzling tragic comedy. Sometimes it can be really humane and sometimes it's just irritating. [Full review in Spanish]
20450	3	a	I expected to leave my viewing of the film feeling battered and bruised, but instead I felt very peaceful. Seeing the strength required for forgiveness uplifted me.
20451	3	a	Depressed is a feeling you're going to walk away with A Private War. Colvin's downward spiral not only sucked the positive energy from her friends and colleagues, but it will take it away from you as well.
20452	4	a	Total Recall begins to self-destruct not long after Schwarzenegger arrives on Mars, and the story degenerates into a violent, stunningly foul-mouthed enterprise.
20453	4	a	More often than not, the movie's tension gets in the way of its giggles, falling back on its stars' comedy instincts and over-extended running gags.
20454	4	a	Staph is no joke, people
20455	6	a	Nice sleights of hand but lacking in emotion.
20456	5	a	I guess a summer special effects blockbuster with plot development is too much to ask for. Maybe I should have my own wiring examined.
20457	9	a	The picture feels edited with a chainsaw, reducing Hackford's story of desire to crummy Lifetime Movie theatrics, wasting the numerous gifts of Helen Mirren along the way. 
20458	9	a	Importation of modern sensibilities into olden times is the gimmick, but now and then, MacFarlane forgets himself and just has fun. Once or twice, he even seems to feel something.
20459	1	a	Ultimately Alpha Dog is most successful as a teen gangster movie, a kind of cross between Goodfellas and The O.C. that is swiftly paced and extremely compelling.
20460	1	a	American Hustle turns out to be a freewheeling party of a movie, one that never stops adding complications and wrinkles and hungry new players to the mix.
20461	4	a	The Expendables should have been the greatest action movie ever made. Unfortunately, the film is a bit underwhelming. Luckily, Crews and Statham save the day.
20462	2	a	Cinema is rarely so menacing and provocative. The Rover is that desired bit of sour in a summer full of cinematic fluff.
20463	4	a	points to the tragic irony of immortality being achieved through early death
20464	4	a	Chadwick Boseman is so formidable that, were the film itself just a bit better, he would eventually be basking in the same sort of year-end accolades that greeted Jamie Foxx as Ray Charles and Joaquin Phoenix as Johnny Cash. Who knows, he may yet.
20465	5	a	I got the feeling that a whole lot of talented people had gone and wasted their time on a project too bland to be worth it.
20466	2	a	It glosses over what exactly made Alan Turing so brilliant, resulting in a monochromatic picture that could have been - should have been - told in bright, striking color.
20467	3	a	Our hero has found his groove among the Lost Generation and, for us, there's some amusement to be had in sharing Gil's thrills -- it's like stepping into a Classic Comics version of A Moveable Feast. 
20468	3	a	It's not the second coming of Christ, but it's a finely crafted piece of work that should not be missed.
20469	5	a	...the story fails to take the high road...
20470	3	a	Film Stars Don't Die in Liverpool shows Gloria Grahame's softer side -- so it's the absolute opposite of the noir films that made her famous. Bening convinces us that Grahame was, for all her eccentric genius and pride, quite soft-boiled.
20471	5	a	Treats interpersonal bonds as a concept that it knows about but can't quite come to grips with, considering all the horsepower and crashes upon which it would rather focus.
20472	5	a	[T]his is a film about catharsis and camaraderie, not logic. 
20473	2	a	It's the funniest comedy he's delivered in years.
20474	6	a	Where A Private War struggles is with its own message. The film wants to shine a light on political apathy, but that message is buried beneath layers of dramatized self-destruction.
20475	3	a	... at once comforting and unsettling -- both in the best possible way.
20476	3	a	It's a fun story that actually gives something more to the characters than most sequels do, from the animated Disney line or not.
20477	0	a	There's something refreshingly spare and rough-hewn about this big-screen experience.
20478	0	a	With the six-hour running time, Giordana gets the space to let the characters live and let their shared story unfold like a good novel.
20479	3	a	Ravishing frocks and heaving bosoms are the main constituents of The Other Boleyn Girl, an entertaining bodice ripper lightly disguised as historical fiction.
20480	6	a	There's a line at which a movie stops being about something nasty and becomes one more example of the nastiness it's supposedly condemning.
20481	3	a	Edgar Wright/Simon Pegg/Nick Frost have become a comedy brand to rival Richard Curtis/Hugh Grant. They've done it by making comedies with real laughs.
20482	6	a	Slow, and subtle, smiling brightly, the picture wins audiences with the charm of Mandela, but descends into a bland film about rugby.
20483	3	a	Light, assured, and utterly charming: Woody Allen's sublime gifts are still intact.
20484	7	a	What's it all about? Not much.
20485	5	a	The Predator has to be the last forgettable summer film. Please... [Full Review in Spanish]
20486	0	a	"Director Todd Haynes has created in ""Carol"" a world so rich in texture, design and mood that it is easy to fall into its loving arms of emotions and get enveloped in its story of love and loss."
20487	5	a	If the point of Country Strong was to prove that Gwyneth Paltrow can sing, then mission accomplished. You don't need to sit through this two-hour melodrama to confirm that.
20488	6	a	"Too lackluster to be praised highly, yet too benign to be excoriated, ""Rock Dog"" is the perfect family film for a rainy day with no other options."
20489	1	a	This remarkable, intelligent and beautifully humane film evokes the smoky, poisonous beauty of the time. Almost perfectly.
20490	7	a	"Black or White"" stumbles even as it tries to move forward."
20491	4	a	You know those animated films that have bits that the parents will enjoy? Rango is mostly those bits.
20492	5	a	There are dumb movies and then there is Crossover, a movie so devoid of logic it will leave you astounded.
20493	1	a	One funk-tastic musical biopic.
20494	0	a	With seemingly effortless grace and skill, Schindler's List balances fear and exaltation, humor and horror, love and death. It evokes, superbly, a time of savagery and grief, and the inexplicable, stunning compassion that rises within and against it.
20495	2	a	Ghost Dog intersperses the rules and regulations of two disparate groups, the Mafia, to dramatize the decline of the old loyalties...
20496	9	a	Its feel-good storyline, shopworn message, and bottomless sermonizing would have played better in Sunday school than on the big screen, which is -- let's face it -- Babylon's turf.
20497	5	a	Moore models some slinky lingerie and Douglas soaks his collars in sweat, while the emphasis on computer gizmos and cyber-babble encourages a verdict of virtual rubbish.
20498	5	a	Nanni Moretti's new film is occasionally amusing, but is also a frustrating and directionless experience. 
20499	1	a	But with Dionne Warwick subtly warbling that theme refrain over the famous studio logo, all my hesitation melted away a good ten minutes later. What's it all about? How about a remake that's worth the price of admission.
20500	3	a	Foster does the frantic head of the family under great threat very well, as she so superbly demonstrated in an earlier state of panic.
20501	4	a	In Stone/Parker's sick and twisted story, an actor will save the planet. That's almost a more disturbing image than the puppet porn. 
20502	3	a	Pixar's new animated action-comedy, about a superhero family stuck in middle-class suburban exile, comes tantalizingly close to greatness.
20503	4	a	"The movie presents an interesting ""Vantage Point."" And its gimmick makes it an above-average thriller."
20504	1	a	Let The Edge of Seventeen remind you in a very real way that adolescence is painful and awkward but also universal in the sense that we all go through it. No one comes out unscathed.
20505	9	a	What's the most positive thing that can be said about the new Rob Schneider vehicle? Well, it's not as pathetic as The Animal.
20506	3	a	As much fun as you should be allowed to have in the dark while still maintaining possession of your clothes.
20507	7	a	The Luzhin Defence was check mated at the opening bell.
20508	1	a	"This ""sunshine noir"" bakes your brain, in a good way."
20509	0	a	Brilliant existential comedy for adults only.
20510	4	a	Very weird fun.
20511	5	a	Basically a tweener cable movie on steroids, with a bigger budget and a larger cast of B-list character actors.
20512	3	a	Vale la pena completamente...
20513	6	a	You can thank Johnny Depp and Johnny Depp alone for any enjoyment you get out of this film. 
20514	6	a	"Ultimately, ""The To Do List"" settles for being intermittently amusing, never living up to the promise of its talented cast."
20515	5	a	I pity Romero. Instead of a fresh Dead film, we're given a bizarre mixture of Day of the Dead and Escape from New York - and not in a good way.
20516	4	a	It won't stick with you forever, but you will enjoy it while it lasts.
20517	6	a	The picture is in desperate need of a personality, a perspective, something that justifies its existence.
20518	6	a	Coming out the loser in the mess is Joe Roth, who shows that heading movie studios hasn't done any favors for whatever directorial ability he may have once had.
20519	3	a	Unlike The King's Speech, which won a clutch of Oscars for its dull propriety and Masterpiece Theater vibe, The Imitation Game is vibrant and lively, engaging you on several levels.
20520	1	a	The real strength of the film is how closely Spielberg welds it to Ray and his family.
20521	0	a	A great performance by Benedict Cumberbatch and an illuminating portrait of the large role secrets can play in our lives.
20522	5	a	I like Seth, you like Seth. We all like Seth. BADLY miscast, here. And so was the director. 
20523	2	a	Veteran character actor Bruce Dern gets his day in court as the grizzled centrepiece of director Alexander Payne's artfully composed, beautifully filmed black-and-white dramedy about an old man, his dream and his withering, yet defiant sense of self.
20524	1	a	Just as there is more magic conjured up in Chamber of Secrets the book, Chamber of Secrets the movie weaves a more powerful spell over its audience.
20525	5	a	More standard programmer than action blockbuster, a remake that may not be offensive but is basically unnecessary.
20526	6	a	Kilner's light touch keeps the romantic pair dancing around their romance without tripping, but as the film reaches the inevitable happy ending, the steps look all too familiar.
20527	3	a	The adults-acting-badly genre is popular in the art-house scene -- Noah Baumbach perhaps being its king -- but despite its wincing moments, Jack has a much sweeter heart than its darker cousins.
20528	2	a	SNEAK REVIEW: I was very disapointed with the rough cut. It unfortunately succumbed to the demise of many movie problems, too many plot holes and unanswered questions.
20529	9	a	Director Paul W.S. Anderson's cinematic style can be summed up in two words: 'ooh' and 'ick.'
20530	5	a	Calls for more explanation and less posturing.
20531	6	a	Glum and self-serving, with only Bening's spot-on performance to recommend it. 
20532	7	a	It's like Lost in the middle of the desert but without the smart mystery, compelling characters and strange monster.
20533	4	a	Filled with cherry-blossom gorgeousness and sentimental homages to small-town Japanese life, it's a film of quiet, telling moments, even when big revelations surface. 
20534	3	a	Provides a mesmerizing portrait of the human side of evil.
20535	8	a	Watching children act, when it's bad, is on par with having a tooth pulled; and suffice it to say, the adult acting is not much better.
20536	2	a	"With a charmingly relatable cast of quirky losers...and a plot that unfolds like a Rube Goldberg construction, ""Logan Lucky"" is ideal summer entertainment."
20537	1	a	A great American film. A dark and sometimes bleakly comic vision of our violent culture.
20538	4	a	A fine example of digital filmmaking.
20539	5	a	David Fincher was simply not the right man for the job and it shows at every turn in a film that is a complete and utter failure at everything it set out to tackle.
20540	2	a	A well-performed, smartly staged B-movie romp that'll keep you on the edge of your seat and have your foot pushing a nonexistent gas pedal.
20541	0	a	This is a film that pulls no punches - it's brutal, violent and at times perverse. It is almost sadistic in how it removes all sense of catharsis from the audience, yet does so with such grace and efficiency that you're constantly shaking your head in ama
20542	0	a	TCCOBB is monumentally impressive. Three hours of pure screen magic.
20543	1	a	contains the best of Godard, both the intellectual and the emotional
20544	0	a	The twists and turns here will mirror something - or better still someone - from your own life as the story unfolds in drawing rooms, piazzas, discos and bars. If every film flowed as beautifully as this one we'd rarely see daylight.
20545	6	a	...a hopelessly overrated piece of work.
20546	3	a	This sense of constant anxiety is the most potent effect of the film.
20547	4	a	In terms of performance and production, this is an undeniably high-quality affair. Yet it's all rather superficial.
20548	6	a	Given the possibilities it's not particularly inventive, but it is nice to see a comedy so affectionate with the conventions it spoofs.
20549	1	a	Whether you enjoy the film or not, it is undeniably something that will generate good discussion and that makes it worth checking out.
20550	4	a	Regrettably, The Miracle Season packages an excellent message inside a mediocre, formulaic sports drama loaded with cliches...but the miracle in Miracle Season has little to do with sports.
20551	3	a	Smart, engaging, and weirdly cool, Ghost Dog defies easy pigeonholing in favor of a complexity all its own.
20552	0	a	Despite its weighty themes, Stephen Frears' film is almost as much a comedy as a drama. 
20553	1	a	"A sci-fi powerhouse, ""Serenity"" is designed to exist on its own terms, which it does, without apology. And that's a good thing."
20554	6	a	What transpires is a tolerable knock-off of the boom-boom bits from The Incredibles, along with some so-so slapstick filler.
20555	4	a	It's lush, stylish and a feast for the eyes and ears rather than the heart and soul.
20556	4	a	The Road Chip isn't exactly what I'd call a good film and has almost nothing going on in the visual department, but for those saddled with kids for an afternoon, you could do a lot worse.
20557	0	a	Although a seemingly risky bet for box office success outside of small arthouse niches, the film's charm and delight of discovery, plus its sterling international performances, could make it a breakout hit in theaters, just as it was in Cannes.
20558	5	a	You get the feeling that the Aliens in the Attic video game probably has more to offer.
20559	3	a	One of Spielberg's most underestimated films, this survival saga of a boy separated from his parents in WWII Shanghai is necessarily episodic, but it's beautifully rendered, offering early evidence of the good actor Christian Bale would become.
20560	7	a	Ragged, messy, and flat, this is Kevin Smith's sophomore jinx; coming right after Clerks, it was a huge artistic and commercial flop
20561	0	a	Effectively employs iconic Woodstock imagery not to regenerate a numbing sense of mass nostalgia but rather as a minimalist backdrop against which to amplify the anguished, intimate ordeal of a frustrated individual who wasn't even there.
20562	0	a	Terry Gilliam shows more pure creativity in this film than in any of his others.
20563	4	a	Burns' latest demonstrates the workmanlike skill with which he's produced a new relationship drama every one or two years.
20564	0	a	Although sometimes bordering on the maudlin, it remains a beautifully uplifting story and a sweet little comedy as well.
20565	3	a	With her sharp wit and a verbal maturity which far exceeds her emotional age, Nadine feels like Juno written by an actual teen rather than an ironic hipster.
20566	5	a	Most of the time, it's as flat and lifeless as Debra Messing's hair.
20567	7	a	Iowa produces more corn than any other state in the Union, and this year it will have to add 'The Miracle Season' to the crop count. 
20568	6	a	In Not Easily Broken, only the husband is a hero-in-the-making. His wife, unfortunately, is nothing but a fall gal.
20569	4	a	Moments of astonishing greatness followed by yawn-inducing romance.
20570	6	a	...[a] stylish but hampered frightfest. There's a questionable routine draft that blows through this particular defective Window...notoriously derivative and repetitive. 
20571	4	a	James makes a funny, likeable doofus, and the expansion of his girth since his hit sitcom The King of Queens is used to great comic effect.
20572	3	a	The movie works, thanks to Walken's and DaFoe's hardcore performances.
20573	0	a	It's not at all trite to state that by the hauntingly bittersweet end, everything magically falls into place, for there is true magic in Motwane's mastery in crafting a such a poetic, passionately felt, and perfectly realized work of art.
20574	5	a	A tasteless comedy that resorts to racism for most of its humor.
20575	4	a	Zachary Gordon, as the wimpy kid of the title, seems to be aiming for a Ferris Buehler-esque omniscience and superiority and, while he doesn't quite pull it off all the way, I was down for his struggle.
20576	1	a	Director Peter Medak opts for exposition and atmosphere over jump-scares and other cheap dramatic devices.
20577	3	a	Love, Simon has a few sad moments as Simon's mistakes come crashing down around him, but mostly it's a sweet, funny, warm-hearted film.
20578	1	a	Steinfeld begins her performance at fever pitch, then cranks it up. It's an astonishing high-wire act, one of the most sustained and perceptive and complete performances I've seen in years.
20579	3	a	An impeccable Hollywood thriller.
20580	0	a	A rich and rewarding experience, then as now celebrated for its intricacy and slowness.
20581	0	a	"Anyone who loved the television show and supported the Kickstarter should adore this film. Rob Thomas and the VM crew deliver a brilliantly constructed film that redefines the phrase ""fan service."
20582	1	a	One of the most caustic and hilarious looks behind the scenes of movie-making since Bowfinger.
20583	6	a	More originality, or at least a better navigation of these well-worn tropes, would have improved this immensely.
20584	2	a	If you're a Russell fan you should know what you're in for and, overall, it's a well-constructed, entertaining film.
20585	5	a	winona spoils the lovely vignettes
20586	3	a	Excellent acting, very good directing, a good tight script -- a little bit of pacing issues and... other characters are nowhere near as investing as Martin Luther King is.
20587	5	a	The movie is being sold as a buoyant confection, I think mainly because its distributor doesn't quite know what to make of its neither-fish-nor-fowl film.
20588	4	a	Ultimately, it neglects to pin the tail on the donkey that deserves it most: an audience that wouldn't recognize caveat emptor unless it was the name of an American Idol contestant.
20589	0	a	A film that sealed Steven Spielberg's talent as a master entertainer.
20590	6	a	You could say Memoirs Of A Geisha is Gone With The Wind without the substance, and certainly without the fiery temperament that made Scarlett O'Hara a lot more interesting than Zhang's geisha Sayuri is now.
20591	9	a	What we're left with is a Mad-Libs version of a dystopian YA adaptation done by someone who saw half of an X-Men movie on TV once, with no depth, no new ideas, and no point.
20592	2	a	Viewers seeking a character-driven end-of-the-world-as-we-know-it tale should be pleased.
20593	1	a	Chalamet is a revelation.
20594	3	a	Filmmaker Lauren Lazin has created a loving tribute to this late star as if he was her own son. Fans will approve.
20595	9	a	Not even the tightly wound energy of Kevin Hart can help it from feeling half-baked, through and through. This isn't a movie so much as it is a studio cash-grab.
20596	3	a	Despite this film's title, don't expect something light and fluffy.
20597	6	a	"A political biopic's most difficult target lies in the elusive circle above character assassination and below hagiography. ""Chappaquiddick"" misses that target."
20598	3	a	Derek Cianfrance's film is a beautifully sustained study in adult themes of emotional crisis.
20599	4	a	Fun enough and diverting enough while you're in the middle of it, but hints of something much richer and more satisfying dangle just out of its reach.
20600	4	a	It works all right as sort of cinematic comfort food.
20601	6	a	The moral dilemmas are gripping, but the film takes itself far too seriously to ever connect with us.
20602	5	a	The damn thing's been soundtracked within an inch of its life. Whenever Ange glides into a room it sounds like a concert harpist's having a coronary. 
20603	2	a	Morris' first two films are as carefully composed and thematically complex as any scripted drama.
20604	9	a	Penn, in his zeal for the character, very simply misses the obvious: this is a spoiled brat who has become disillusioned with his parents.
20605	0	a	This is quite simply glorious filmmaking.
20606	4	a	The mix of comedy and melodrama is pretty well done.
20607	4	a	It all turns out to be quite touching as Muppet movies go.
20608	5	a	"Final proof that ""based on actual events"" means absolutely nothing."
20609	4	a	Grows on you like kudzu.
20610	3	a	Rooney's Lisbeth takes matters large and small into her own hands with a ferocious self-sufficiency that leaves the audience gasping with both horror and a provocative delight not entirely undiluted with envy. Likable, no, but impossible to easily dismiss
20611	5	a	Why hire a star, or 'allow' a star to hire himself, and then give him nothing to do? Why hire a star who doesn't seem able to do much to begin with?
20612	0	a	Empire of the Sun is not as graphic as the hellish worlds of Schindler's List and Saving Private Ryan, but Spielberg doesn't sugarcoat the horrors of war.
20613	4	a	"It's hard getting past the benign ""menace"" of the gangs, the corny out-of-touchness of the parentals, the stodgy morality of it all."
20614	3	a	For those seeking an afternoon weepy, the film's poise might be its Achilles heel - we never feel the howl of real heartbreak. But for everyone else, two words will suffice: pure class.
20615	9	a	Nothing but one big chase scene...It plays as if robots even wrote the script -- and stupid robots at that.
20616	5	a	For a film ostensibly concerned with the mess and tumult of modern life, I Don't Know How She Does It presents some pretty pat solutions.
20617	1	a	As usual, the sidekick animals steal the show. That tradition goes all the way back to those singing mice in Cinderella. Maybe even before then.
20618	5	a	Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels is a movie with absolutely nothing to say.
20619	3	a	It is Frances McDormand who seals the deal, pulling the humour, rage and heart of this compelling - if at times difficult-to-watch - drama together.
20620	1	a	"Matchstick Men"" comes through with a quality script written around characters the audience cares about."
20621	5	a	[A] fairly mundane thriller.
20622	0	a	Cosmopolis is an investment that pays off enormous dividends.
20623	8	a	Headed in only one direction: straight into the toilet.
20624	2	a	Will Smith is a remarkable talent, his reactive comic timing a thing of beauty.
20625	2	a	Sensitive and sympathetic character study, offering gentle insight into a self-segregated community.
20626	2	a	Beautiful to look at and difficult to embrace, this is a movie of moments, not of overall narrative force.
20627	1	a	A movie for the ages.
20628	3	a	a classic a shaggy dog story [that keeps] things moving with an effervescent sleight of hand.
20629	3	a	It works as well as it ever did. It works because Mann makes it work.
20630	3	a	Sophomoric, vulgar, obscene and brilliant.
20631	5	a	The mundane plot of Snake Eyes is disguised with lots of camera razzle-dazzle.
20632	3	a	As he did in When the Cat's Away, Klapisch demonstrates an understanding for the way young people caught between the demands of adulthood and their lingering adolescence behave.
20633	4	a	The promise is dangled yet never developed. Rather, the narrative slips into a backstory that alternates between confusing and contradictory.
20634	2	a	This uneven psychological thriller has its share of chills, but Depp and Turturro are a hoot.
20635	3	a	A disorganized, confusing but amusing biopic.
20636	9	a	There are some films that are hardly worth the trouble of watching: once you've got the central concept, you can pretty much run the movie in your head.
20637	5	a	We've seen this all before, and quite frankly; it's starting to get a bit boring.
20638	2	a	Thanks to Cranston's performance - along with a game supporting cast - and Brad Furman's tension-building direction, the movie works.
20639	5	a	Even Stallone seems to be sleepier than usual here.
20640	3	a	[Allen's] most purely delightful film in many years.
20641	3	a	A movie of unique ideological derangement that simultaneously demands and defies precise decoding.
20642	6	a	The movie's 'message' -- life is more than just sports -- is delivered with the delicacy of a piano dropped from a fifth-story window.
20643	4	a	Fanboys laughs with Eric and the gang, not at them. It celebrates how pop culture can bring people together, and that a dream is important even if it only matters to you.
20644	3	a	Yet another accomplished, stylistically courageous work from a filmmaker whose willingness to take chances and pull them off is his finest attribute.
20645	8	a	It examines modern motherhood in such a superficially generic way that you'd swear the movie thinks no one has ever brought up the subject before.
20646	2	a	Lively but overlong
20647	0	a	American Hustle is a big, bold, and brash study of big, bold, and brash characters.
20648	3	a	At the centre are terrific performances from Freeman and Richard Armitage as the dwarf Thorin, plus all the lush scenery, majesty and magic we've come to expect from Jackson - strengths that will have us counting the days until part two.
20649	5	a	Less a taut whodunit than a dreary who-cares-it, Mystic River is muddy-swamp-slow and about as appealing to look at
20650	4	a	Flightplan, nerve-racking as it is, stops well short of its final destination.
20651	3	a	Although Rocky II builds itself around a rematch between Rocky and Apollo, the movie is anything but a lazy sequel.
20652	4	a	A little self-consciously kooky but with an ace soundtrack that combines gypsy punksters Gogol Bordello with real-life plug-pullers this sure beats putting your head in the oven.
20653	9	a	Full of windy speeches about honor, god, fealty, and so on, the movie comes to a literal standstill whenever one of these noble addresses is about to be delivered.
20654	2	a	A desolate, dark and thought-provoking film that explores the aftermath of societal collapse in the Australian outback.
20655	0	a	A spectacular film, as messy, strange and funny as a dream, with hedonistic party scenes to rival The Great Gatsby.
20656	3	a	Danny Boyle returns to direct and uses the same relentless mix of music, camerawork and editing to induce that familiar adrenaline-fuelled movie high.
20657	2	a	This is one of those movies that gives independent cinema a good reputation. It's one of those little gems that isn't seen in most of the country, but should be.
20658	1	a	Silver Linings Playbook is defined by the positive decisions that are made in the face of imperfection, desperation, and the desolate wasteland of your world in pieces.
20659	4	a	When it works, which it does quite often, it's one of the better comic book adaptations of recent years.
20660	5	a	Rarely terrible, let alone memorable, it's a brutally average piece of disposable summer entertainment that fades from the mind like some hazy, half-sleeping dream.
20661	4	a	Spielberg is pretty much incapable of making a terrible movie anymore. But he has plainly forgotten a lot of what makes a good popcorn movie since his Jurassic period. Where's the fun?
20662	4	a	The Way Back is fascinating until it becomes an ordeal.
20663	1	a	"Watching ""A Most Wanted Man"" now, knowing that it's the last time we'll see Hoffman explore such an imperfect soul, just makes the experience that much more engrossing."
20664	3	a	Don't believe the negative hype. Valkyrie is a stupendous film, and represents two of the most exciting hours I spent in a theater this year.
20665	6	a	those who remain patient through the film's several dry spells will be richly rewarded in the end stretch
20666	3	a	Hanks is a terrific choice for the lead because he can appear strong and military without slipping over into Sgt. Rock corniness.
20667	3	a	Engrossing, if emotionally evasive - featuring Benedict Cumberbatch's exceptional performance...
20668	1	a	Enhanced by nimble ad-libbing from the comedy-trained cast, the screenplay is delightful, by turns funny and emotional...
20669	6	a	I, Frankenstein delivers what it promises, but focusing solely on mass destruction and shapeshifting gargoyles leaves little time to develop Adam as a rich, full character - that's what sequels are for, right?
20670	6	a	Only intermittently engaging and too timid to be satisfactorily funny or insightful.
20671	0	a	Zinnemann's drama depicts the spiritual tug of war of a young nun, beautifully played by Audrey Hepburn, between adherence to vows of chastity and obedience and rebellion against those values for her self-fulfillment
20672	5	a	Barnyard moves with a frenetic energy, especially in the numerous barn dance and chase scenes, that will probably keep family audiences moderately entertained. But it doesn't stand up to this summer's relative bonanza of animated family films. Moo.
20673	1	a	Nicolas Cage does such an outstanding job meshing his instincts for the role with the quirky behavior, that it comes across as a 'natural' blend of actor and character.
20674	2	a	An expansion on the character that might not have been necessary, but certainly feels worthwhile.
20675	4	a	It's frustrating that Cameron couldn't make a proper documentary, because the footage is astonishingly beautiful, the subject matter is compelling and the timing is eerily relevant.
20676	9	a	The movie doesn't feel authentic and I think it's because of all the white folks involved.
20677	4	a	I walked away from Into the Wild feeling that Penn was too in love with the idea of Christopher McCandless the free-spirited hero to excavate the soul of Christopher McCandless the lost man.
20678	9	a	Spins its wheels and goes nowhere fast.
20679	4	a	The characterisations are just a little unorthodox and the whole thing, despite a soggy middle during which nothing much happens, goes with an above average swing.
20680	5	a	Shooting for satire and hilarity but landing limply in a no-laughs-land between sit-com and cartoon, A Million Ways to Die in the West offers you at least two times that many ways to disappoint in the theater. 
20681	3	a	There's a profane but strangely tender rawness to this sometimes brutal movie, anchored by Compston's remarkably assured debut performance.
20682	9	a	"My mouth slowly widened, until I realized that I was indeed illustrating what ""jaw-droppingly bad"" truly means."
20683	3	a	Emotionally engaging, impressively directed and frequently tense drama with strong performances from a terrific ensemble cast.
20684	4	a	A steady, engrossing thriller.
20685	5	a	Not only is it deadly dull, but the killer actually courts the audience's sympathy.
20686	9	a	The Darkest Minds isn't concerned with telling a coherent story or showing us interesting characters, only existing to set up a franchise. That failed, but worst of all, everything in this movie we have seen before and done better
20687	3	a	This opulent, multi-layered mystery offers unconventional, cleverly intricate, intriguing entertainment.
20688	6	a	This film is very nicely shot and acted, but the simplistic script makes it difficult to properly engage with.
20689	3	a	The running time and pacing may scare some, but Dominik has crafted an instant classic, with poetic visuals, sensational performances and a true love for the genre. Magnificent.
20690	4	a	Seinfeld's animated feature flies a little too fast to leave a lasting impression.
20691	2	a	Outdated prison film.
20692	1	a	absolutely wonderful
20693	3	a	Must Love Dogs proves that you can teach an old genre new tricks.
20694	5	a	"That this retrograde ""straight talk"" somehow managed to emerge on screen as a reasonably genial ensemble comedy speaks to the strength of its performers."
20695	6	a	It isn't that John Carter is bad, it's just really mediocre. And mediocrity is deadly in this genre.
20696	1	a	The film is the finest balance yet of Martin McDonagh's bleak sense of humor and offbeat moral sincerity.
20697	2	a	In roughly two hours, Osment has already outgrown both his pants and his role.
20698	0	a	Primo Jackie--excitement and laughs aplenty.
20699	3	a	It Comes at Night is a powerful, slow-burning horror, a distressing and nihilistic examination of human nature that lingers in the mind long after the shocking denouement.
20700	5	a	An admirable yet underwhelming attempt at something a little different. 
20701	3	a	Maybe this tribute to those early movies will inspire you to go watch something small, square and silent.
20702	1	a	Sorrow-laden and moving, Still Alice isn't gratuitously grim nor is it easily sentimental. There's humor here -- vaguely gallows-like, perhaps but also earned.
20703	7	a	A video-store leftover, suitable only for viewers who have nothing better to do.
20704	6	a	The humor is forced and awkward, and the film struggles with the message it is trying to send. 
20705	3	a	The humor in The Savages is born out of the performances by Linney and Hoffman, two actors who can convey as much about their characters as the ones around them with a seemingly effortless, instinctual ability.
20706	3	a	"After dealing with racism on a neighborhood level with his last film, ""Gran Torino,"" Clint Eastwood takes on the subject on a grand, political scale while also offering a partial portrait of Nelson Mandela, a role Eastwood vet Morgan Freeman owns."
20707	6	a	...an uneven, disastrously overlong piece of work.
20708	6	a	The film is like a crossword puzzle. It keeps your interest until you solve it. Then it's just a worthless scrap with the spaces filled in.
20709	4	a	The results are entertaining and capably acted, but true insight remains at arm's length, despite a feature cooking up all sorts of ghoulish visions and barely concealed jealousies. 
20710	3	a	John Carter is a product of a simpler time, when sense of adventure was paramount, and the film has this in spades.
20711	3	a	Skyfall is a great movie. It's a welcome sight to see it bring the franchise into modern filmmaking.
20712	5	a	I got angrier at Nebraska the longer it trudged on.
20713	4	a	Sausage Party may be the most un-PC mainstream movie to hit cinemas in yonks and it may outrage, shock and even repulse you at times, but it is undeniably ridiculously funny.
20714	3	a	What we're left with is a touching love story, an outsized spectacle and a glorious bit of color in an often all too drab world.
20715	0	a	If this heartwarming teen-oriented bildungsroman is any indication of how Hollywood plans to handle homosexuality in the future, the culture has truly turned a corner in terms of teaching tolerance of sexual preferences.
20716	3	a	It's so funny that you'll be snorting popcorn out of your nose before the end.
20717	6	a	The Edge of Love has, as they say, all the tools, all the elements that usually make for success. It ought to be coaxing superlatives from all and sundry, but instead it leaves a bitter, unsatisfying aftertaste that lingers in the mind.
20718	1	a	This is a story, you will agree, that has been told before. What distinguishes Kasdan's telling of it is the style and energy he brings to the project.
20719	4	a	Jarmusch gets an absorbing and fascinating performance from Whitaker.
20720	3	a	[Screenwriter Andrew] Bovell and director Anton Corbijn keep us guessing about motives, especially Karpov's, until the last moments.
20721	4	a	A Spielberg-esque adventure full of modest frights and lots of magic.
20722	4	a	A visually kick-ass flick with elaborate costumes and design -- and not much else.
20723	4	a	If it's been reduced to cinematic pablum, it's still fairly palatable due to its engaging cast and a glossy production.
20724	7	a	The weirdest and rarest misfire in Lee's illustrious career.
20725	0	a	Whether he's dead or alive, this film reveals Tupac to be a scared, skinny kid with a gun, and a vulnerable human being who could easily be pierced by bullets, just like the rest of us.
20726	3	a	A leisurely paced, intense, gloomy but ultimately, fulfilling motion picture.
20727	4	a	Overlong and stuffed with too many catchy but unnecessary songs, this worthy film is nevertheless indicative of a more sensible and sensitive side of Bollywood.
20728	3	a	Strikes just the right balance of irony and sincerity...genuinely heartwarming, from its opening dedication to Henson and Hunt to its joy-to-the-world finale. [Blu-ray]
20729	3	a	Defying laws of physics, laws of acting, and the law of diminishing returns, Fast Five delivers a ridiculously fun mix of motorized macho mayhem and multicultural bonding.
20730	5	a	If you are offended by purposeless terrible deeds and unrepentant evil, skip it. Otherwise, it's a great movie to chat about over a nice, fluffy dessert.
20731	7	a	By the end of the film you'll likely be more confused about HIV/AIDS than ever, and that's just the way Leung wants it.
20732	3	a	A thoroughly engaging, beautifully directed and superbly acted romantic drama that packs a powerful emotional punch.
20733	5	a	thin, dull, messy story that's short but feels much longer. It's all flashy explosions and effects and no substance.
20734	2	a	Enjoyable black-comic romp.
20735	10	a	Another gimmicky one-joke comedy from the Wayans brothers that may not use as much makeup as White Chicks but lots more special effects and is even more dreadful.
20736	7	a	Lazy screenwriting drags down the efforts of two Oscar winners... surrounding a television star making an unexciting leap onto the big screen
20737	1	a	On a visual level, the movie qualifies as poetry in stop-motion.
20738	2	a	Penn does a great job of capturing the feel of the book, but falls a bit short of achieving the depth of Krakauer.
20739	3	a	Someone please sign McConaughey to a multi-picture action contract that also has a stipulation banning him from starring in movies with J. Lo or Elizabeth Hurley.
20740	7	a	A galling, casually offensive, and deeply unsatisfying film.
20741	5	a	How do you know you're watching How Do You Know? When you start dreaming of crossword puzzles and Diane Keaton.
20742	6	a	It doesn't have the chops or the ambition to wrestle with the questions it raises.
20743	6	a	The movie never really works because it's hard to root for a screen romance when one of the actors is stiff and unsympathetic.
20744	4	a	Unfortunately, the material that De Palma chooses to hang his flair on feels like a paltry version of No Way Out as if penned by Crichton or Grisham.
20745	6	a	Simultaneously gorgeous and forgettable, sentimental and prurient.
20746	4	a	If you think Catherine Zeta-Jones is pretty, you will like this movie quite a bit. Forgettable otherwise.
20747	4	a	Also helped immeasurably by an unusually cool score by John Powell, Mr. Liman also makes good use of the European settings, alternating between close ups of Damon's frustrated face and wider pans that slurp up the snow clad France setting.
20748	1	a	[It] raises questions about religion and conformity but never challenges them directly. Instead, it offers a rare window into a religious community that steers clear of modern society, and into a man who, with his foibles and frailties, is all too human.
20749	3	a	Coming-of-age movies are usually pretty dismal, so it's refreshing to discover Monsieur Ibrahim, one that's worth recommending.
20750	4	a	...ultimately reduces a potentially rich battle against the forces of inertia to utterly familiar melodramatic tropes.
20751	3	a	The quality of Hoffman's work is admirable, even Oscar worthy, as is the co-starring performance from Amy Ryan.
20752	6	a	Glumly dispiriting
20753	4	a	Features some good acting - you show them, Beyonce - but too many stories drain the effect of the film.
20754	7	a	You can keep Liv Tyler as an actress altogether as far as I'm concerned.
20755	4	a	David O. Russell picked the right cast, but the wrong genre, for a sincere meditation on insincerity.
20756	1	a	Poetic, resourceful, sparse and marginally pretentious.
20757	10	a	A heaping piece of rancid garbage.
20758	4	a	Miami Vice is a dazzler.
20759	7	a	While it's hard to recommend it on purely creative merit, I suppose it would be a wonderful thing if these silly flies ended up pushing kids to investigate space travel and the legacy of NASA. Unlikely, but it's more comforting than fart and burp jokes.
20760	2	a	Koreeda's restrained style and gentle pace may try some viewers' patience, but if you can roll with it, it's a lovely, poignant slice of life.
20761	8	a	If Disney execs are interested in salvaging what remains of the studio's reputation -- and its dignity -- they might stop for just one moment to think about what Uncle Walt might say.
20762	3	a	When it comes down to it, Paper Heart worked for me because Yi is really good company.
20763	4	a	A very sweet movie, Slater and Masterson encompass real sparks
20764	5	a	The corny jokes and the tired plot will make any self-respecting adult grimace.
20765	1	a	A work that in its finest moments comes across as a Coen Brothers film with anthropomorphic animals instead of flesh-and-blood humans.
20766	1	a	Is the movie trying too hard? In moments of self-doubt, I wonder...I found the performances stellar and I was emotionally rocked and rolled; I ask for little more.
20767	9	a	A poorly-paced bland crime drama that has all the twists and turns of a 'Bewitched' episode.
20768	3	a	If only most sequels were this good.
20769	9	a	Crap
20770	2	a	Ghosts of the Abyss is an amazing technical success. Whatever happens in the movie itself is of little consequence.
20771	4	a	McDormand's powerhouse performance alone compensates for many minor deficiencies.
20772	6	a	Jack's a good guy, and you root for him all the way to the end, but, wistfully, that doesn't make him an any more interesting everyday Joe than he is.
20773	4	a	Has enough laughs and silly subplots to keep you looking, but in the end it's the work done by the two leads that saves the film.
20774	6	a	A soapy love story that gallops across a snowy Autumn Hallmark card.
20775	1	a	The animation, special effects and sound effects are top drawer. This family-friendly entertainment package comes with a lasting side benefit.
20776	5	a	... before the movie is half over, the usual cliches take over ... 
20777	0	a	Director Michel Hazanavicius, in his first American production, has pulled of a miracle, making a gimmick with a pretty wispy framework into something sturdy, memorable and moving.
20778	5	a	The end of Zellweger as we've known her. 
20779	0	a	It Comes at Night is not an easily watched time at the cinema, but through its perilous devastation and mood is a rewarding and valuable time, spent with your own anxiety and the lump in your throat that you try to choke down.
20780	3	a	With a hilariously smart script and a terrific cast, this romantic comedy rises far above the pack, engaging us emotionally and intellectually while offering some telling observations on the state of modern relationships.
20781	4	a	It is Depp, as the debauched and decaying Restoration rake, who holds the camera. It's a strong, sturdy performance, but one that asks more of the audience than it might be possible to give.
20782	4	a	a should-have-been masterpiece that admittedly has its moments
20783	3	a	An atmospheric, disturbing and bloody movie, very true to the video games. [Full review in Spanish]
20784	8	a	This magical fantasy-in-reverse is perhaps the best family film of the year.
20785	1	a	I suppose the phrase 'serious romantic comedy' sounds like a paradox. But that's exactly what 'Silver Linings Playbook' is: an intelligent, edgy dark comedy with romance at its core. 
20786	1	a	A mournful meditation on America's heritage of violence...
20787	6	a	Minor ... a one-sided infatuation that always looks fancy, thanks to Darius Khondji's exquisite Parisian cinematography, but isn't as fanciful as its dreamy foundation suggests.
20788	3	a	It's nice to have something so outrageously silly to lighten things up.
20789	9	a	Never work with children or animals. Unless you're a child or an animal, in which case, never work with Cuba Gooding Jnr.
20790	5	a	Weakly entertaining Middle Ages fantasy.
20791	3	a	Allen's self-directed criticism of nostalgia worshippers could still come off as hypocritical, but his inventive approach instead results in one of the most charming, funny, and genuinely likable films that he's made in years.
20792	4	a	Theron is clearly the reason to see the film, but even her impassioned performance is strictly by-the-numbers.
20793	4	a	Edge Of Seventeen does a very fair job of portraying the anguished inner life of its needy adolescent protagonist.
20794	3	a	The unique format of the motion picture shows how valuable it can be, for what else can be used to so vividly capture the most important element in a story like this -- its cultural setting?
20795	3	a	Another excellent, less-than-flattering biopic of a Hollywood icon.
20796	1	a	A thought-provoking, emotionally resonant, and innovative cinematic experience.
20797	4	a	The Light Between Oceans is an effective melodrama, but the lingering sensation the film leaves after its end is that it might have been much more.
20798	4	a	This isn't brain surgery; this is daffy entertainment that plays to its strengths, with director Steve Carr trusting in James' deadpan earnesty
20799	3	a	As brainless as the movie incarnations of both South Park and Beavis and Butt-head, Jackass is just as funny as both -- and better than many of the so-called comedies Hollywood produces.
20800	8	a	It takes a particularly weird kind of sincerity to end a movie that has been for its entire running time an exploration of surfaces... with its most sublime and humane gesture.
20801	0	a	Those who see it will, quite frankly, not believe their luck. It is that satisfying, that engrossing, that good.
20802	6	a	[Writer-director Craig Brewer] displays a real passion for the music and a knack for using it to create mood. But it's not enough to overcome the thinness of his characters or the greeting card sentiment that pulls the rug out from what came before.
20803	3	a	[Logan Lucky] is packed with deadpan humour, speedway action and a myriad twists.
20804	1	a	It's smart, edgy, and filled with some of the best performances of the year
20805	0	a	It sticks to many of the conventions of the form - printed titles, an effortless musical score, a loyal dog, and shameless melodrama - and has fun with them, yet also manages to be surprisingly heartfelt.
20806	7	a	The movie is listless and uninspired.
20807	6	a	One of the most gifted actors of his generation, Philip Seymour Hoffman makes his debut behind the camera, even while starring in the title role, and the verdict is ... a deep disappointment. 
20808	6	a	It's too bad to work as thriller, but not nearly bad enough to earn a place in movie infamy.
20809	1	a	If the film seems obvious compared to the novel, it captures Yates' idea that the young, even naive, Frank and April are play actors in their own lives...
20810	3	a	If only for Grier's performance, Coffy is a must see.
20811	3	a	Rocky III marks the point where the series starts to get silly, but the end result is so enjoyable that it's hard to carp too much.
20812	6	a	A picturesque portrait of irresistible romance led by emotionally naked performances.
20813	4	a	Surprisingly watchable for the third sequel and despite its general predictability it's entertainingly inventive.
20814	0	a	It tests our patience, but then rewards it, not only with beauty and terror, but also with an emotional sucker punch that has yet to be equaled.
20815	9	a	I hope the series has the good sense to stop with this less- than-convincing beginning.
20816	9	a	Depp's character is an uneasy blend of hammy matinee idol and Clouseau-like farceur, while Jolie is in the running for the most annoying and insipid ice maiden in cinema history.
20817	5	a	It delivers nothing more than paint-by-number, visually appealing drivel.
20818	6	a	can't hold our interest for much more than five minutes
20819	4	a	Partnering its ursine heroine's progress with that of a female walrus calf, Adam Ravetch and Sarah Robertson's documentary combines stunning wildlife footage with an environmental message.
20820	8	a	A disposable film adaptation that provides nothing but a pretentious desperation for Fox to kick off another franchise.
20821	3	a	There is a great deal to relish about this spirited and keenly observed coming-of-age story that plots out its protagonist's changing fortunes with a mix of sensitivity and alacrity.
20822	9	a	Is it worse as a love story or as a drama about the sorry state of television news? The answer: It's a tie.
20823	6	a	A relatively satisfying ending that leaves just enough of an opening to warrant a sequel if the box office receipts are right.
20824	3	a	Events are economically detailed, and the hypocrisy is revealed through not just the lowest of deeds, but the failure to hit heights so nobly articulated.
20825	3	a	The movie's best effect is its star...He looks every bit like an actual demonic wild-thing, retrieved from deep within the German wilderness and trotted out to perform for Murnau's camera. 
20826	3	a	It flutters, like a mischievous butterfly, above the despairing hands of easy description.
20827	6	a	Works where it counts, on the emotional level.
20828	5	a	So overrated. 'My Big Fat Greek Wedding' for the nineties.
20829	4	a	Kubrick worked in an uncharacteristically naturalistic style despite the genre material, with mixed but still fascinating results.
20830	4	a	Good clean post-apocalypse fire-breathing fun.
20831	6	a	Slightly above-average, somewhat dawdly and meandering romantic comedy. Angelina Jolie is at her most tolerable.
20832	3	a	One of those small, deliberately paced, but charming foreign films in which not much happens plot wise, but a lot happens to the characters emotionally.
20833	6	a	In a world in which Gary Coleman-for-governor campaigns and dramatic TV movies about the rise of the Partridge Family really do exist, 'Dickie Roberts' is too late to have much impact.
20834	2	a	Full of sympathy for the worker's plight.
20835	5	a	It has its heart in the right place, and earns its few moments of emotional resonance, but they don't elevate the story past the thoroughly commonplace.
20836	4	a	If you like your jokes raw and saucy, Sausage Part hits the spot.
20837	1	a	A fascinating depiction of a turbulent time in American history.
20838	3	a	Harris puts in a believable and focused performance.
20839	4	a	Persuasive sci-fi tech talk, soulful romance and an earnest stab at metaphysics combine in director Mike Cahill's polished second feature.
20840	0	a	Its timeliness is a spine-chilling reminder that those who do not know their history are doomed to repeat it. Its story provides a blueprint not only of the past, but of the way forward.
20841	4	a	If the crisis the couple endures seems real, the resolution needs a little more work to be convincing.
20842	5	a	One-joke Travolta comedy.
20843	0	a	A pure joy from start to finish.
20844	6	a	[Peter Jackson's] efforts to filter or self-edit - assuming there were any - remain fruitless.
20845	2	a	Heads out of the treehouse at an abominable crawl, but once the honey starts to flow, it picks up speed and becomes the sweetest film of the series.
20846	3	a	Law, chronically aware of his own charm, doesn't mimic Caine's performance; he rei-nterprets the character and sparks it with a new life, making Alfie thoroughly his own.
20847	2	a	Jack kicks plenty of butt, and the film has some neat little twists and turns to keep things interesting - and an ending the really has some guts.
20848	3	a	For all the movie's cute kids and sentimentality, [Damon] is the warm-hearted and convincing heart of this uplifting flick.
20849	4	a	As long as you don't mind making fun of the afflicted, there are some killer comic moments.
20850	0	a	Great, fantastical fun.
20851	2	a	Older viewers will enjoy the nonstop onslaught of playful observations and astute jokes.
20852	5	a	The story, like the cinematography, is overly foggy and under-illuminated.
20853	5	a	Craig Brewer, the promising director who hit it with Hustle and Flow, seems to harbor a need to exorcise his white burden through films centered on black music.
20854	8	a	It offers its not-so-profound socio-political commentary in a pointlessly showy style thatsays more about its creator's self-importance than any message he wants to deliver.
20855	3	a	What sets this romantic comedy apart from most Hollywood romantic comedies is its low-key way of tackling what seems like done-to-death material.
20856	0	a	A composition of gestures stripped of romance and presented in their barest forms.
20857	3	a	Factor in a scene-stealing dog called Uggy and you have one of the most unexpectedly delightful films of the past year.
20858	3	a	"Midnight in Paris"" is a bonbon to ease the craving for Allen's earlier, funnier films."
20859	5	a	A lazy, hasty effort that offers little beyond a few jack-in-the-box startles and a high body count, including Hewitt's bouncing about in a shirt half-unbuttoned over a bikini top.
20860	5	a	The humans, none of whom have strong enough personalities to engage, look enough like people but Toby looks like a shrunken version of the Big Boy mascot.
20861	3	a	The film is a landmark in LGBTQ representation, but succeeds on its own merits.
20862	4	a	A disjointed attempt at covering far too many angles and artists to make for a cohesive film ... this isn't the movie that'll get these musicians the respect they deserve.
20863	3	a	Black Snake Moan plays its grim subject matter for laughs, imitating the laugh-to-keep-from-crying quality of the blues tunes on its soundtrack.
20864	5	a	Whatever provocative notions this concept carried are smothered over by dissonance and contrivance.
20865	6	a	Watch this movie if you haven't. It's a goddamned national treasure.
20866	5	a	Even the most ardent evacuees from Super Bowl madness will recognize the familiar road map that the screenplay diligently follows.
20867	1	a	Apatow is clearly a romantic, even if there's a profane edge to his 'love conquers all' worldview. Other filmmakers embarking into the comedy minefield could learn a thing or two from him. He's two for two.
20868	9	a	It all gets more and more ridiculous as event piles up on event, leading to a turn of melodramatic excess that defines a new sort of pornography that has nothing to do with sex, but is obscene nonetheless
20869	8	a	Compilation essay film of the propaganda celebration of the nuclear age, both in cartoonish and apocalyptic form... So long as there are unstable madmen with nuclear codes clutched in their fists, fear rightfully abides. 
20870	3	a	A sweet reminder of the importance of family and community, human and canine alike.
20871	4	a	Bening and Watts are good enough to see it through, and it's good to see Jackson actually play his age for once.
20872	4	a	For the most part, it thankfully succeeds rather well and comes off as an engaging and entertaining entry in the genre.
20873	3	a	As Kim, Mackintosh's performance finds and holds the right notes, of shyness, determination, privacy and love.
20874	9	a	A Christmas lump of coal.
20875	6	a	Tries to make up for the story's complete lack of significance or motion with some very nice scenery and a few very nice people. It does that so well that at times, it's almost enough.
20876	3	a	An ultra-quirky animated Western with a vocal tour de force by Johnny Depp that's quite unlike anything I've ever seen.
20877	5	a	This is the kind of empty film that usually plays on airline flights.
20878	5	a	Hardly Stanley Kubrick's best work.
20879	2	a	Despite the poor performances and easy resolutions, Christopher Robin is entertaining and at times funny. [Full Review in Spanish]
20880	4	a	Although Into the Wild carries with it a tragic undercurrent, Penn illuminates the graceful aspects of Christopher's ultimate search for self to overall illuminating effect.
20881	4	a	What a treat to see a comedy that starts funny, is funny in the middle, and ends funny - unlike the usual Hollywood model in which all the humour is used up in the first act setting up the premise, and then winds down into sentimentality.
20882	3	a	mostly good, lighthearted entertainment with more than its share of bad chicken puns
20883	3	a	A major studio takes aim at itself in a series of mostly successful sketches parodying the underhanded ways movie companies have of marketing their fare.
20884	2	a	Like 'Homeward Bound' and 'Incredible Journey,' it teaches tiny tots that - with friendship and love - you don't need superpowers to be a hero.
20885	3	a	Maybury at least makes it lush, which is a relief from the drab realism of other English lit biopics.
20886	7	a	it's too late to recall the results of this election
20887	3	a	Feudal honour is challenged by love with overwhelming consequences. Even die hard Zatoichi-ites will admire the deftness of Yamada's masterly direction.
20888	6	a	An ambitious but confused film about basketball, draft dodging and sleeping with professors' wives.
20889	3	a	Iain Softley directs his feature debut with simplicity and feeling, and you don't have to have been a Beatles fan to get with the beat. Gives you hope for the British film industry.
20890	1	a	It actually works in a nasty, tasteless sort of way.
20891	1	a	A cold and unappealing drama that is almost cripplingly middle-class.
20892	4	a	Jack Goes Boating is a film of many excellent moments that offer fair compensation for the fact that the whole doesn't really work.
20893	5	a	The screenplay piles it on with extra storylines, all of which give no nuance to the characters or make any of the conflict more exciting or original.
20894	2	a	Though not every element of the grander mystery story works, there's plenty here to keep you thinking.
20895	2	a	Enough twists and turns to satisfy the most diehard mystery lover, as well as memorable characters and funny dialog for those of us who need a little more.
20896	3	a	The Artist is charming as all get-out, a delightful little movie about the movies.
20897	5	a	It's a slight affair, but the cute Heffalump and some cartoon slapstick are endearing enough to its target audience.
20898	3	a	Even if flashy Ritchie's tall tale about the East End underworld starts to run out of steam, the punch line is so good that it makes up for a lot.
20899	4	a	One can't deny its seriousness and quality.
20900	4	a	Not so much a rom-com as an anti-romance comedy, this brightly amusing British film makes us laugh fairly consistently, although the story itself is pretty grim. 
20901	7	a	confuses sex with romance
20902	4	a	This movie has all the wit of the original Warner Brothers Cartoons, and a few updated jabs at modern society.
20903	5	a	essentially a futuristic Night of the Living Dead without the social commentary, pacing, or interesting characters
20904	5	a	The war is over, the movie is available in some form to the general public, and the natural response after viewing? The film wasn't worth all the fuss it generated.
20905	0	a	[Ava DuVernay] manages to get both the small and the big moments. Thiis at one of the best movies of the year.
20906	4	a	Silly and derivative, it's a bit of a primeval disappointment.
20907	3	a	Makes us laugh and frustrates us at the same time.
20908	5	a	Nelson's intentions are good, but the end result does no justice to the story itself. It's horribly depressing and not very well done.
20909	2	a	Director David Fincher tells this imaginative story with uncharacteristic warmth, but with his usual sure sense of control and technical skill.
20910	3	a	Not all of the film's quirks are given a proper resolution, but they don't need to be. It has an honest emotional landscape, which is what ultimately matters.
20911	5	a	Teenage stereotypes have seldom been done worse than this.
20912	3	a	The intrigue and intensity of the war and espionage plot are compelling, but Cumberbatch captivates as Turing.
20913	4	a	The kind of groovy, easygoing, good-hearted affair that manages to entertain despite its shortcomings. Fanboys will leave you with a smile across your face for ninety minutes.
20914	6	a	An interesting idea, but it doesn't really have much to capitalize on outside of the authentic period reproduction.
20915	7	a	A shamelessly sentimental comedy with a few crude gags thrown in arbitrarily.
20916	6	a	Only clever in fits and starts
20917	7	a	This is a glowing example of everything wrong with formulaic sports flicks.
20918	6	a	Who knew conversing with the dead was so much like a visit to the therapist?
20919	0	a	"Flat out, ""How to Make an American Quilt"" is a wonderful movie -- soulful, funny, eccentric and filled with a love of female humanity."
20920	0	a	There can be something absolutely liberating about a movie that makes up its rules as it goes along.
20921	4	a	... good-looking but not quite memorable ...
20922	3	a	Graphic look into heroin addiction. Not for kids.
20923	3	a	Sharply directed and superbly acted, this is a hugely entertaining and frequently hilarious sci-fi comedy that stands as a worthy addition to Shaun of the Dead and Hot Fuzz in the so-called Cornetto Trilogy.
20924	6	a	...never becomes anything more than an inoffensive time-waster...
20925	3	a	Russell keeps the outcome interesting; he knows that every silver lining has a cloud. 
20926	6	a	Couples Retreat plays like the NBA All-Star game: What seems like a dream-team exhibition of pros at the top of their game too often turns into an undisciplined mess.
20927	4	a	It's depressing to think how much better this could have been in the hands of a skilled director.
20928	5	a	A big, loud, snarky, garish, testosterone-saturated, nearly incoherent cartoon...[but] that might be enough to satisfy a lot of viewers.
20929	1	a	Reilly does nice work playing his big lug's insecurity and struggle to let his friend go, but Silverman delivers a performance that's downright moving in its expression of yearning - on a couple of different levels, interpretation depending.
20930	1	a	Bond's latest is a remarkable high watermark for the series: at once solemn and deeply funny, sexy and sad, self-conscious without all the rib-bruising elbowing.
20931	5	a	Not a single scene connects smoothly with the next, characters make head-scratching choices that come out of nowhere and logic consistently proves itself an enemy to be avoided at all costs.
20932	4	a	This supernaturally tinged tale only goes skin-deep and is proud of it, wasting little time in establishing narrative basics and getting to the good stuff.
20933	1	a	Chicken Run boasts the most delicious collection of desperately funny Brits since The Full Monty. Poultry has never been so stuffed with personality.
20934	8	a	A film of enormous integrity, it's exquisitely acted, beautifully written, sensitively filmed and filled with memorable moments.
20935	8	a	I could live with Good Luck Chuck's determination to humiliate a cutie pie such as Alba and its ongoing cruelty toward obese women.
20936	4	a	Earns laughs with some well-executed set-pieces.
20937	4	a	Nobody plays put-upon quite like Ben Stiller.
20938	1	a	It's such an entertaining film that it's almost possible to forget its didactic agenda, which is certainly part of the point. 
20939	5	a	A group of actors this appealing, and a director-Julius Onah-this promising, should be put to better use. Netflix, give them a Black Mirror or something instead.
20940	2	a	The movie doesn't so much tug at your heart as give it a series of vigorous yanks.
20941	2	a	Intriguing, well-structured and mildly engaging with strong performances, but its balance of comedy, melodrama and romance feels slightly uneven and contrived.
20942	6	a	Movies like National Security are indicative of how little creativity exists in most high-profile Hollywood offerings, and how little faith filmmakers have in the intelligence of multiplex audiences.
20943	1	a	It's the first full-length work by writer-director Patty Jenkins and marks her as a gifted portrayer of emotional intimacies and wrenching acts of violence.
20944	3	a	A flawed but smart independent film whose virtues outweigh its flaws, and whose virtues are distinct.
20945	3	a	Upholding franchise traditions in amusingly grisly style, the Reaper's latest round-up is definitely up to snuff.
20946	9	a	o Webber mazi me ton aytokanibalisti Thomas Harris frontizoyn na makelepsoyn enan ap' toys pio eikonikoys haraktires tis mythologias toy tromoy toy aiona mas, kai na ton ypobibasoyn se enan akomi fonia mias opoiasdipote tyhaias slasher tainias, me proshim
20947	5	a	General Boredom meets Major Tedium on the Civil War fields of Virginia.
20948	6	a	Russell is obviously working out his considerable angst ... but in an admirable attempt to opt for a manic, stream of consciousness energy, he ends up annoying his audience instead.
20949	6	a	Clearly contrived, yet at times undeniably funny. Still, from this cast, you may be expecting more substance and less sophomore. 
20950	6	a	Think about adding To Catch a Thief or Charade to your Netflix queue instead.
20951	2	a	American Pastoral doesn't quite nail its tone, but it's a compelling enough adaptation with a few truly inspired moments.
20952	7	a	I'm sure it's fun to be a multi-millionaire, but whatever creativity and dignity Ivory Wayans had to offer the world in his youth is lost for good in Little Man to a series of crotch wallops and fart jokes.
20953	3	a	A serpentine, snow-smudged and wood-smoke-thick stroll in the shoes of a dead man walking.
20954	6	a	"The Darkest Minds"" really fails because it never really manages to separate itself from the pack of other, dangerously similar films."
20955	5	a	"Cosmopolis"" is proof that a film can be provocative yet completely un-enjoyable."
20956	2	a	Writer-Director Koepp well understood the best qualities of the story and held back the almost demeaning payoff as long as he could.
20957	3	a	Kasi Lemmon's Black Nativity tries to be many things at once, and it's astonishing how well all of the pieces fall together. 
20958	4	a	Once it gets going, it's actually quite fun.
20959	4	a	McDormand's flawless performance is worth the price of admission.
20960	4	a	"A ""smart"" thriller - the title itself is intended to convey that this is an ideal summer popcorn movie - but it's a little too tricky for its own good."
20961	4	a	Hedlund has a surprisingly rich singing voice, the mahogany tones giving depth and stature to an under-written character.
20962	9	a	It's a posturing, pandering tale of sexual obsession in thrall to its own overweening self-importance.
20963	3	a	Blazingly good anti-war sentiment.
20964	6	a	The ill-advised mansion purchase is just the first in an endless series of blunders in this half-baked thriller.
20965	3	a	Perhaps Scott's only film that warrants his emphasized visuals.
20966	4	a	The best thing you can say about The Infiltrator is that Cranston and company are entirely persuasive in a film that doesn't make the best use of their stellar efforts.
20967	1	a	...an engaging, sporadically enthralling drama that ranks as one of Eastwood's better efforts as of late.
20968	5	a	An intermittently admirable but largely incongruous work that suggests not only divergent sensibilities on the part of the two neophyte filmmakers, but a certain indecisiveness regarding their core audience.
20969	4	a	Both funny and sad, the comedy was in the vein of Brooks' Terms of Endearment, except it was more eccentric and nuttier and in moments genuinely touching due to strong chemistry between Jack Nicholson and Helen Hunt.
20970	5	a	So paper thin that the former 'king of controversy' was able to cram the entire plot into one little crossover rap song that's currently playing at a radio station near you.
20971	1	a	A damn fine western, an entertaining throwback to classic B-pictures that pays clever tribute to its predecessors.
20972	3	a	Beautifully shot, wonderfully acted and superbly written, this is a hugely enjoyable, frequently funny and sweetly surreal comedy that marks a long-awaited return to form for Woody Allen.
20973	10	a	Bateman and McCarthy are left stranded onscreen while we are supposed to be chortling at slobber comedy and fat jokes.
20974	6	a	The Darkest Minds is a solid enough dystopian sci-fi YA adaptation, elevated by Amandla Stenberg's performance, but it won't revive this film trend.
20975	4	a	Figuring out the ending is only half the fun, anyway; watching a master helmer like Scott navigate through the twists and turns of Matchstick Men is really the more interesting journey.
20976	4	a	The passions aroused by the discord between old and new cultures are set against the strange, stark beauty of the Mideast desert, so lovingly and perceptively filmed that you can almost taste the desiccated air.
20977	5	a	Coneheads falls flat about as often as it turns funny, and displays more amiability than style.
20978	4	a	"If only this movie could have stopped at ""Eat."
20979	6	a	Isn't the disaster some industry observers predicted, but it's not the high-gloss masterpiece some of us hoped for either. 
20980	7	a	Brings together almost a dream team of elements which add up to only a very small fraction of the sum of their parts. The movie's just a huge mess. 
20981	5	a	Still Alice certainly has a superb lead performance in Julianne Moore, but directors Richard Glatzer and Wash Westmoreland focus more on the situation than the story.
20982	6	a	While it is very, very far from being the worst or most insipid thing Disney has down with these characters, it puts up a good fight to be the most dull.
20983	0	a	It's one of those unique, introverted gems, like The Accidental Tourist or The Piano, that either enfolds you with its generosity of spirit or leaves you cold.
20984	4	a	...absorbing, and at least for now the definitive take on Deep Throat. 
20985	0	a	Ready Player One dares to redo nostalgia... [Full review in Spanish]
20986	5	a	Another unwanted, unneeded remake. The mind boggles that Dennis Quaid, delivering more corny lines, is stepping into the role of the legendary Jimmy Stewart.
20987	0	a	Powerful
20988	3	a	Tyrnauer succeeds in making a documentary in which man and his creations are one and the same. Yes, Valentino lives in opulence, but his gowns exist in that stratosphere too.
20989	3	a	Cumberbatch refines his Sherlock Holmes routine and carries a rousing movie about how English cryptographers cracked Germany's military code and shortened World War II.
20990	6	a	On the surface, everything looks great, but look just below, and it all falls apart.
20991	4	a	The cracking performances from Alba and Cook do wonders at papering over these creative fissures.
20992	3	a	A revolutionary teenage comedy that works for both moviegoers and people of the LGBTQ community-and boasts an outstanding star-turning performance by Nick Robinson.
20993	0	a	Fukasaku's set pieces are dynamic, composed and edited with a neatness that is missing from the shaky-camera esthetic of the movie's successor, 'The Hunger Games.'
20994	0	a	While we can still marvel at the amazing sights laid out before us, it is imperative that we never lose sight of who's who and what's at stake. That turns out to be a tall order.
20995	6	a	Plays like it was dragged kicking and screaming into a traditional biopic structure.
20996	9	a	If you don't think Kevin Kline in drag is funny, wait 'til you see Will Smith in drag -- it's even less funny.
20997	7	a	The thing looks like it was written in a week, directed in two, and forgotten about by all involved in less than three.
20998	2	a	Good, occasionally powerful noir that's been overhyped.
20999	2	a	Lo and behold, the film held my interest the whole way through, and yes...even made me chuckle here and there.
21000	5	a	Between the slapstick, pointless celebrity cameos, in-jokes and steady stream of feeble puns, the violence is surprisingly graphic.
21001	6	a	Long-winded, ponderous and without much in the way of compelling drama.
21002	0	a	"Ambitious even as it studies, exploits and explodes ambition, ""American Hustle"" is as good as any American film this year. It's also a lot of fun. Don't miss it."
21003	5	a	We want to remember. We want to revel. We want to watch things explode. Stallone only understands one of these things. So yes, there will be explosions.
21004	6	a	I respect director Ben Younger for going to the trouble of trying not to make a cookie-cutter boxing movie. Unfortunately, I think the film would have been better served by a more straightforward approach.
21005	3	a	Van Sant's low-key, experimental high-school drama is an affecting rites-of-passage tale, told with bold style and quiet integrity.
21006	3	a	Martin McDonagh has choreographed an almost impossible feat of a brutally dark comedy that, thanks to both Sam Rockwell and Frances McDormand, elicits an emotional response you simply don't see coming. 
21007	3	a	It is a simply astounding feat of animation with such attention paid to details like the lighting and even the hair of characters.
21008	4	a	The writing is generally smart, and the connection between Cage and Lohman feels genuine. But the movie is as empty as a telemarketer's pitch.
21009	1	a	What makes the film so interesting is that it's not just a docudrama, not just a sensationalist expose, but a fully realized drama that involves us on the human level as well as with its documentary material.
21010	3	a	Hong Kong action director Ronny Yu... brings a slick, kinetic, cartoonish energy to the proceedings. 
21011	3	a	This is a film with more visual creativity than many fantasy films.
21012	5	a	As entertaining as watching the last bits of ketchup drip out of the bottle.
21013	1	a	Baratz's work may not be the slickest, but he took a risk and followed through under arduous conditions to let an audience share in a mystical journey. The film itself is an act of faith.
21014	4	a	Was the conclusion unforeseen? Definitely. Did it make me think about or learn something about the human condition? Not really.
21015	8	a	Some storylines conclude, some collide, others dissipate. But the film's main crime is this: It's boring.
21016	3	a	Downey, Foxx and director Joe Wright ultimately pierce the more artificial elements to deliver an unusually perceptive film.
21017	1	a	Even if you're offended - and perhaps rightfully so - there's another joke coming around the corner to change the subject. And some terrifically wild characters to keep you laughing.
21018	8	a	Tim and Eric were reportedly gleeful at mass audience walkouts during a recent Sundance screening, and they probably delight in savage reviews, bearing them with pride. Well, congrats, guys: You suck.
21019	5	a	can't quite get over the inertia of its failings
21020	1	a	Skyfall gets off to a fast start. I can't recall when I've enjoyed a pre-title sequence more. 
21021	6	a	Beautiful people in exotic locations provide a serviceable espionage romp in 'The Tourist.'
21022	4	a	It's not a classic, but it's proper fun.
21023	3	a	There isn't a single scene that is anything less than stunning to look at
21024	8	a	An aggressively inept demon-seed chiller starring a bunch of grown-ups who should've known better.
21025	4	a	Don't expect to be blown away, but it's a pleasant comedy-drama.
21026	2	a	A popular family film, also known for its Oscar-winning score and song
21027	0	a	It's a compelling, entertaining film. Even when it's nihilistic, pessimistic and macabre, it's still eminently watchable and profound.
21028	4	a	The script, written by director Binder, tries to say too much, and in doing so, loses some of its charm.
21029	0	a	A mysterious, sensual prism through which to view our own shortcomings and longings.
21030	4	a	Comic action, appealing hero, splendid dogs; some scares.
21031	6	a	It's an insanely ponderous and almost insulting sequence, stopping the movie cold and forcing the viewer to scratch their head in utter disbelief.
21032	1	a	Unbearable tension is coupled with wit and the consistent element of surprise.
21033	0	a	While the idea of a biopic about a journalist may not appeal to many, A Private War does something spectacularly different with the genre which keeps the audience on the edge of their seats...
21034	4	a	By describing the structure of a great trick in a movie about a great trick, The Prestige makes a promise it can't keep. Its third act is about as convincing as a photo of a cow jumping over the moon.
21035	1	a	One of those rare teen movies that actually gets teens right.
21036	6	a	After a while we're stuck with a one-joke concept that got old months before the movie came out and gets older still as the movie wears on.
21037	6	a	Christopher Robin may engage adults who have grown up with Winnie the Pooh, but for children, it offers very little in the way of fun. 
21038	2	a	Scotland's four favorite dope fiends are still fun to watch, even if they don't have all that much on their minds.
21039	3	a	The observations about parenthood, pro and con, are quick and smart, and Scott effortlessly steals the show, softening Westfeldt's brittle cuteness.
21040	0	a	A complicated FBI sting operation is combined with not one, but two love triangles in this sharp, witty comedy drama topped by an audacious ending. The writing crackles with authentic-sounding dialog and the acting is superb.
21041	1	a	Gladiator brings back the glory that was Rome.
21042	2	a	It is good, not great, and it is the two stars that make this worth the price of admission.
21043	8	a	The approach has all the lasting charm of a train derailment, but at least the train is going somewhere before it is brought to disaster.
21044	4	a	The ending is a bust, but there's a wealth of good stuff here.
21045	3	a	The Imitation Game makes a compelling case for futzing with the details of a biopic in order to get a more engaging message across. 
21046	6	a	the kind of original, clever, off-kilter filmmaking that's easy to appreciate, but hard to like
21047	5	a	Arctic Tale isn't a documentary. They say it right there in the title, see? It's a tale. [Blu-ray]
21048	3	a	Cumberbatch nails it. If only the film did, too.
21049	4	a	The bodily function jokes are about what you'd expect, but there are rich veins of funny stuff in this movie.
21050	6	a	So disjointed it's hard to tell if Russell dumbed down the film in the hope of garnering a larger audience, or if I Heart Huckabees simply isn't as smart as it likes to think it is.
21051	0	a	One of the coolest movies to come down the pike in years.
21052	6	a	This is one flight that never quite gets off the ground.
21053	4	a	"Ficarra and Requa don't always have the firmest grip on storytelling needs, but they manage to find life in the middle of Hell, with ""Foxtrot"" achieving levels of entertainment other pictures of this ilk have failed to acquire."
21054	8	a	While Hero offers a symphony of visual wonder and epic splendor, The House of Flying Daggers is a quieter chamber piece, but nearly Hero's equal in grace and beauty.
21055	4	a	As films go, it's more like Stars In Their Eyes as you listen in wonder and look for faults in the excellent impersonators.
21056	9	a	An interesting premise quickly degenerates into a bad zombie flick that doesn't follow its own rules.
21057	5	a	There is no real sense of urgency here. Anton Corbijn's chilly, detached directorial style doesn't help.
21058	4	a	It depends on plot gimmicks like the convenient arrival of enemies and the equally convenient arrival of friends to the rescue. It doesn't dare enough.
21059	5	a	Longer. The laughs are stoner-random, and few and far between, 
21060	4	a	The suprise packet of the film is Vanessa hudgens, cast against type as the Goth-ish girlfriend.
21061	6	a	Shows, once again, that most [video games]... are best left in their original form, allowing people to get their visceral thrills in the way they're accustomed -- with a control pad.
21062	3	a	too odd to dismiss and often truly funny
21063	0	a	"Can proudly be placed alongside ""The Empire Strikes Back"" and ""Blade Runner"" as one of the best science-fiction movies of modern cinema."
21064	0	a	No words are needed. [Full review in Spanish]
21065	3	a	"First Reformed"" sees Paul Schrader return to his roots, and through the aesthetics of grace, find his way home. "
21066	5	a	Not terrible, but this MTV teen movie falls flat.
21067	4	a	Whenever the fighting stops and two people have to stand and talk, all the air goes out of everything. Suddenly it feels as if we're in an empty theater, watching a dusty old sword-and-sandal epic.
21068	0	a	As usual, Herzog works the madness for any poetry he can find...
21069	3	a	Let us not underestimate the contribution of our lead. Roberts plays down the glamour and turns up the soulfulness, and her off-the-charts likability makes her winning and watchable, even when Liz is at her whiny wimpiest.
21070	1	a	Both perplexing and engrossing as it explores humanity's animal instincts. This being McCarthy and the Coens, nothing is spelled out. The seeds are there and they will flourish in a fertile mind.
21071	0	a	Mel Gibson's personal vision of the persecution and death of Christ is relentless, brutal... and brilliant.
21072	2	a	It is like Winnie the Pooh: it might be of Very Little Brain, but it's the Very Big Heart that matters the most.
21073	9	a	Worth seeing only if you've seen all the better movies now in release.
21074	3	a	Despite its title, Tyldum's film isn't some imitator or wannabe. Rather, The Imitation Game, highlighted by a layered turn from Benedict Cumberbatch, is the real deal.
21075	3	a	The fine actors show how we bond to those not related to us by blood -- and also how we love. Bring Kleenex.
21076	1	a	A computer-generated animated adventure about retired superheroes, blends action, humor and even a touch of earnest emotion into a dazzling visual package.
21077	1	a	...a distinctive, eerie, unsettling and suggestive film on every cylinder. And for a film that contains few orthodox horror elements, it's also damn good and what it does.
21078	3	a	It's hard not to feel good while watching Chadwick Boseman exuberantly disappear into the role of the Godfather of Soul.
21079	6	a	Far too simplified to be effective and far too manipulative to be affective.
21080	3	a	Paper Heart is a kooky, gentle movie that's all about love, and well worth a look with an open heart.
21081	3	a	A wistful little film that gradually insinuates itself upon your consciousness.
21082	6	a	I wouldn't want to be there when Duckie finally detonates.
21083	5	a	Leaving behind the laughs for schmaltz, Hancock chickens out at the last minute, lurching toward a cop-out happy ending that gives every indication of having been reshot at the behest of test audiences. Well, at least you won't be bored.
21084	6	a	This here is high-concept cinema. And the filmmakers will spend the next two hours trying to pound that into your noggin.
21085	3	a	The film is sumptuously shot, lit, scored and acted.
21086	0	a	This is a powerful film that will horrify you and make you angry, if you dare to see it.
21087	0	a	A cinematic perfect storm of technique and sophistication, widely hailed as the apotheosis of all the innovations and advancements of the sound era.
21088	9	a	Quickly followed by Superman V: The Need to Explain What The Hell We Were Thinking.
21089	3	a	"Safety Not Guaranteed"" is charming, laugh-out-loud funny, and unpredictable; basically all the things a unique indie comedy like this should be. ""Safety Not Guaranteed"" is just fantastically enjoyable from all sides."
21090	3	a	Wonderfully, smartly funny, an entertaining treat to watch.
21091	4	a	Essentially a popcorn movie put together by a director who knows how to generate suspense and build tension.
21092	5	a	Doesn't add a lot to the Watergate movie canon or to the understanding of Watergate in general, nor does it have much of a read on Felt the man
21093	3	a	"Without overlooking its lapses into populist bathos, it's necessary to rescue It's a Wonderful Life from its spot at the centerpiece of untouchable American ""classics."
21094	10	a	Anyone interested in an early visit to Purgatory is directed to this excruciatingly unfunny, frequently repulsive movie.
21095	3	a	A character-driven dramedy with equal parts humor and heart, Safety Not Guaranteed is a magical film about the human spirit whose charm is impossible to ignore.
21096	4	a	By keeping the parody and humour so tightly focussed, they've generated more laughter than any other filmmaker this year.
21097	4	a	The huskies are beautiful, the border collie is funny and the overall feeling is genial and decent.
21098	4	a	"Silent Hill"" isn't worth clamoring about."
21099	5	a	If you've seen Space Chimps, you can expect the same level of quality. It's not excruciating, but it's entirely forgettable.
21100	9	a	An instant contender for cult status on the midnight-movie circuit, where lines like 'Do we look like quantum wormhole specialists?' will be given the respect they deserve.
21101	2	a	The irreverence at the perceived end of the world constitutes Night of the Comet's biggest selling point: borrowing some of the cheekiness that George A. Romero used so well, and making it the main dish rather than the garnish.
21102	1	a	Oscar-winning actress Judi Dench is miraculous, giving the title character extraordinary depth and resonance.
21103	2	a	You'd think the weakest link in Fanboys would be that it's all in-jokes, but they're actually not so 'in' that a casual fan won't get them.
21104	3	a	If Valentino doesn't reveal much about the man, it argues convincingly that the elaborate gowns, like the vintage one Julia Roberts wore to accept her Oscar, will outlive him, anyway.
21105	3	a	Beresford knows the only way to deal with schmaltz is to just go ahead and embrace it.
21106	1	a	A sweet little trifle, very much the equal in romanticism and charm to the movies it's emulating, and it's playful to a nearly impossible degree.
21107	3	a	A Great Wall is about the sort of visit I imagine most of us would like to make, back to the people and the ways of life where we, or our ancestors, came from. 
21108	8	a	Maybe I'm missing the joke. Hell, maybe I'm the punch line, since I couldn't find any good ones in this borderline unwatchable motion picture.
21109	5	a	This is fun, but not as much fun as just playing Doom.
21110	4	a	Leave before the excruciating finale and you should have an OK time.
21111	6	a	"I Don't Know How She Does It"" suggests what might have happened to Carrie if she had two kids with Mr. Big to worry about, and less time to obsess over her wardrobe."
21112	5	a	A good movie gets you hooked by introducing a fascinating story, likeable characters or thrilling action. The Skulls has none of these.
21113	6	a	More neurotic than poetic.
21114	2	a	What his other movies have done summarily or languidly, Lock, Stock, and Two Smoking Barrels does with some clear novice stumbles. It's creative and very clever. It's just not a classic.
21115	6	a	The movie is like an infernal machine that consumes all of the energy it generates, saving the last watt of current to turn itself off. It functions perfectly within its constraints, but it leaves the viewer out of the loop.
21116	3	a	An exhilarating and emotional musical drama which once again pushes the limits of modern film-making.
21117	0	a	Watching this film has something of the elemental thrill of watching a cloud-shadow spread with miraculous speed over a vast, empty landscape: it has a chilly, portentous intuition of what America is.
21118	3	a	Warm-hearted in the way a movie can be when it knows its people inside out.
21119	2	a	Joss Whedon's unassuming science-fiction adventure is superior in almost every respect to George Lucas's aggressively more ambitious screen entertainments.
21120	5	a	Despite using the same premise and numerous identical plot points, this remake replaces suspense with boredom and witty dialogue with lame lines any self-respecting actor should be embarrassed to utter.
21121	1	a	Valkyrie is a highly intelligent and deeply engrossing historical drama and, frame for frame, the year's most suspenseful nail-biter.
21122	3	a	This repitilian horror thriller is the stuff of which nightmares are made.
21123	6	a	Each successive revealed secret is less believable and yet somehow more obligatory than the last, because, after all, this is an old-school Asian melodrama.
21124	4	a	A breezy escape with just the right dash of whimsy.
21125	3	a	...thanks to Garbo, its supporting cast, and director Ernst Lubitsch's magic touch, it remains one of Hollywood's most sparkling products.
21126	3	a	An entertaining addition to the caper comedy genre of films.
21127	5	a	A thrill-less thriller. Too violent for kids.
21128	2	a	Good writing and editing serves the episodic tragedy concept with rather strong gripping power.
21129	2	a	Koreeda's latest, Our Little Sister, is closer to the fairy tale tone of his nearly-flawless childhood adventure, I Wish, although this exploration of family obligation and loss is less challenging than his prior output.
21130	2	a	I'm not really sure there's any age where you're ready to see Sausage Party's epic, virtuoso climax: a graphic bacchanal conducted entirely by the contents of your fridge. Let's call it an acquired taste.
21131	3	a	You will not like the Second Earl of Rochester. But you will not be able to take your eyes from him. Having made his bed, he does not hesitate to sleep in it.
21132	3	a	An oddball tribute to the art of conversation -- you know, just hanging out and talking with friends.
21133	3	a	A film that is worth rediscovering so many years after its premiere - you might have a pleasant surprise. [Full review in Spanish]
21134	6	a	Director Rob Marshall Chicago is so transfixed by all the ritualistic hoo-ha that he never brings the story down to earth.
21135	9	a	So trivial and unimaginative that, unless you're desperate for sci-fi diversion for the kids, you should wait for the dvd.
21136	4	a	It's Mrs Doubtfire without knobs on.
21137	4	a	Those who enjoy the Rogen/Goldberg humor will undoubtedly be laughing for much of it, and even those with more sophisticated senses of humor will find a few things to chuckle about.
21138	6	a	Neither exciting nor entertaining, [Billy Lynn's Long Halftime Walk] is recommended for Ang Lee completists only.
21139	1	a	The most stunning thing about Pleasantville is the film's look, which rivals that of the year's other two most visually-impressive productions, Dark City and What Dreams May Come.
21140	7	a	Shouldn't romantic comedies be a little more romatic? Or maybe at least likable?
21141	5	a	I get the sense that if this film really clicks with you, it is something that you'd really love and hold dear. I, on the other hand, just couldn't get into the film.
21142	4	a	This ghost story is a real gollywhopper, a voluptuous, sumptuously festooned saga of love, lust, jealousy, money, madness, secrets, ambition and spirits that refuse to let go.
21143	3	a	Meet the Parents generates most of its laughs in the give-and-take between Stiller and De Niro.
21144	6	a	A slowly-plotted, mostly uninvolving modern-day Miami film noir...
21145	3	a	In Carol, director Todd haynes shows us his hability to exploit themes about gender roles and secual orientation with a very submersive story. [Full review in Spanish] 
21146	3	a	This is an old-fashioned movie told with cutting-edge technology and while it is easy to be cynical about such a lightweight plotline, it is refreshing to see a movie that approaches its subject with an authentic, wide-eyed sense of wonder.
21147	4	a	...the exceedingly familiar storyline does tend, within the film's meandering midsection, to prevent one from wholeheartedly embracing the material...
21148	4	a	There's an enjoyably old-fashioned brand of adventure at work here, when Weir doesn't handcuff himself with Red scare politics and maudlin sentimentality. The former outweighs the latter, but only just barely.
21149	1	a	After languishing in second-banana roles in such films as Picture Perfect and Rock Star, Ms. Aniston here creates a fully realized character of surprising nuance and depth.
21150	4	a	It's an efficient genre workout, with plenty of shocks and splats and a political subtext, but most impressively, it successfully combines dread with the domestic...
21151	4	a	Chances are you'll still respond to the dark wit, but you probably won't be, ahem, Lima Yankee Foxtrot Alpha Oscar.
21152	5	a	The reveal is eye-rollingly bad, a moment of affected profundity Michod's long, winding road trip never earns.
21153	3	a	The gentlest direction that director Lasse Halstrom has ever demonstrated.
21154	3	a	...ultimately establishes itself as a compelling little drama...
21155	0	a	I have no problem signing on to recommend this. Get it? Signing on...John Hancock... nevermind.
21156	7	a	Even at under two hours, Shanghai Noon feels lengthier than a double bill of The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly and Once Upon a Time in the West.
21157	2	a	"...after a dismal first half hour, it changes from a piteous low intellect attempt at humor to a light-hearted takeoff on Bruce Willis and the ""Die Hard"" movies."
21158	4	a	There's no doubting the sincerity and there's little point in offering up cynical resistance to an all-singing, all-dancing, all-emoting gospel finale.
21159	5	a	Boring, and decidedly misogynistic.
21160	9	a	This film feels like a torturously overlong TV episode, and it takes itself so seriously that it has none of the camp value of the original film or the show's sword 'n' sorcery competition.
21161	4	a	Predictable sports comedy sequel offers some life lessons.
21162	3	a	It is a blessing that this film was made and the inspiring story of India's greatest sporting hero told to a generation who might otherwise never have known the legend of 'The Flying Sikh.'
21163	4	a	"Bell slips back into her Veronica character with ease, and while newbies to the franchise might wonder what the fuss was all about, the ""Marshmallows"" are happy. "
21164	3	a	It's good to see Hudson in a major film again. As an actress, she's still a work in progress, but she has a commanding gift for depicting vulnerability and strength almost simultaneously.
21165	4	a	It's a shame so many jokes don't land or feel like lazy puns, but there are plenty of great visual gags. 
21166	0	a	Like his earlier films, Wright refuses to rest on mere genre convention
21167	4	a	The story surely is interesting, but in this form, not terribly enlightening.
21168	4	a	Not a classic like Reservoir Dogs but a perfectly watchable thriller thanks to a cast of old pros.
21169	2	a	Predictable, schmaltzy, and old as the hills, but so well-made that it is a sort of triumph.
21170	1	a	The film is captivating.
21171	0	a	A genre-defining science-fiction thriller with echoes of old-fashioned film noir
21172	3	a	A smart and jittery sequel.
21173	10	a	The least watchable movie ever to star Tom Hanks...
21174	3	a	Some will be uncomfortable or appalled, and the mix of humour and horror is uneasy, but this isn't a film you'll forget easily. And, seriously, what would you do?
21175	3	a	Vibrant and coldly compelling, Mystic River succeeds in spinning a profoundly American tale on the level of grand tragedy.
21176	2	a	this is an emotional struggle that can't have a completely clean resolution, and Still Alice doesn't try to force one
21177	2	a	The filmmakers seem to be concerned about preserving her innocence, just as the real-life Kennedy was. It may be a bit idealistic, but it's not a disservice.
21178	0	a	The best work that either DiCaprio or Winslet has ever done. Mendes masterfully conducts controlled fireworks of verbal savagery to suit the age of apropos and good reputations.
21179	4	a	Chamber of Secrets is not quite the magical mystery tour that the first one was. Despite some major improvements, the movie is often sluggish in pacing and intrigue.
21180	6	a	An onslaught of familiar flashbacks and war montages sometimes reduce A Private War to the usual passive preachiness of such horrors... Still, Pike manages to compel us to believe in the spirit of Colvin.
21181	4	a	The terrific ensemble cast...help to invigorate Not Easily Broken from being merely a ho-hum, contrived film to a mildly engaging melodrama much like a Tyler Perry film.
21182	7	a	Anyone who might want characters and not cliches, compelling dialogue and an intriguing scenario, look elsewhere.
21183	2	a	So, is Selma the film I wanted? No. Is is a good film? Yes, but it's not great.
21184	3	a	Never overdoes itself, and its story never distracts from the action.
21185	3	a	"John Requa and Glenn Ficarra strike a nice balance between ""war is hell"" and absurdist comedy"
21186	4	a	If the picture doesn't ultimately live up to the raw vitality of Cheadle's performance, it remains an uplifting snapshot that broadcasts its message with zero distortion. Tune in and you won't be turned off.
21187	2	a	... part high-tech thriller, part high-energy action spectacle, with a dark undercurrent and solemn gravity constantly goosed by goony comic relief.
21188	4	a	Heffalump certainly seemed to satisfy a rapt audience of young children at a Saturday morning screening and who can argue with that?
21189	3	a	Ralph Breaks the Internet works because it doesn't pander, and it doesn't simplify.
21190	5	a	Tyler, a true beauty, gives the role a valiant try, but her range is too limited to play this amalgam of female perfection.
21191	6	a	Deeply mediocre ...
21192	10	a	Attention sadists: Demand more from your gorefests than this pro forma return to the well. Has mass murder ever been this dull?
21193	4	a	Christopher Robin pricks the surface, and it'll certainly leave you with the warm and fuzzies, but the story sticks a little too closely to the surface.
21194	2	a	Isn't the equal of Michod's previous film, but it shows that he's hardly a one-hit wonder, but rather a filmmaker of vision as well as finely tuned technique.
21195	2	a	From the title to the steamy B-movie sex and the juke-joint environment, Black Snake Moan is a blues lyric come to mythic life. Some filmgoers will find it bizarre and over the top, but others may like its utter originality and daring eccentricity.
21196	1	a	"It's the quiet moments that hoist ""Bleed for This"" like a title belt. Simple but not that simple."
21197	0	a	The way the film has been made, nothing that happens seems inevitable -- which is to say, anything seems possible. There's a word for that sensation. It's called excitement.
21198	5	a	The only reason it's matinee price instead of full price is that I felt that it all went too well and too American-style easily.
21199	3	a	A thrill ride worthy of a real-life amusement park.
21200	4	a	You have to applaud a movie that takes every rule for How to Sell Your Movie to Modern Audiences and throws it on a silver nitrate fire.
21201	2	a	At least Westfeldt is trying. She tries hard to make this a grown-up version of the romantic-comedy formula, complete with dirty jokes and sex talk.
21202	10	a	I have to admit that I am baffled by Jason X.
21203	3	a	It's exceptional work from Servillo, matched well with Ferilli, whose visual contribution to the film is profoundly sensual. 
21204	6	a	"As romantic comedies go, ""Larry Crowne"" is neither swooningly romantic nor howlingly funny."
21205	6	a	How, exactly, did an idea with this much star power and comic potential manage to misfire?
21206	4	a	Now considered a trial run for the more moving, horrifying and involving Schindler's List, Steven Spielberg's drama, set in China during the Second World War, is a glossy and rather tame affair.
21207	3	a	Veronica herself is such a breath of fresh air as a strong female character: smart, secure, resourceful, loyal, funny and not the slightest bit chickish. 
21208	3	a	Outer-space pirate treasure hunt lots of fun; fab animation.
21209	1	a	Whilst Shaun and Fuzz were content to just throw out gags, this film has more of a message about maturity and the nature of human behaviour.
21210	4	a	Paolo Sorrentino's film is really just a huge turn-on that has the bad manners to go sour, succumbing to its own self-delusions of moral/political grandeur. 
21211	4	a	Sedgwick liked attention and she liked having fun; at least the movie honors half of that.
21212	1	a	The glitz and glamour of the Ocean's trilogy is in a completely different area code than Logan Lucky, but Soderbergh's latest has the same terrific camaraderie and joy as those movies.
21213	3	a	Brings light to a little-known facet of the Holocaust in a way that does justice to its moral ambiguities.
21214	2	a	Definitely worth a look.
21215	6	a	Look, if you turn off your brain and just let the succession of images wash over you, the film can be dumb fun, just don't go looking for anything remotely resembling comprehensibility. That apparently does not exist in the Predator universe.
21216	3	a	Even watered-down blood runs red.
21217	0	a	Nigh-on perfect.
21218	6	a	a political pamphlet not very different from others that come from left-leaning Hollywood these days
21219	3	a	For a sequel with a Roman numeral in the title, Jurassic Park III is more entertaining than expected.
21220	5	a	As well as this may have worked as a comedy ... it tries too hard to be a thriller and a drama, which is where it falls flat on its face.
21221	3	a	Mr. Borte conjures up a pleasant Stepford that runs less on robotic conformity than on endless, anxious competition. The key to the film is that it allows this life to have some real appeal.
21222	9	a	At first, I thought Cold Creek was proceeding deliberately, but then I realized it's just boring.
21223	3	a	A mystic and mesmerizing journey of adventure and self-discovery.
21224	2	a	Come for the brutal slaughter, stay for the comedy.
21225	4	a	Whatever happened to no hugs, no learning? It's enough to bring you out in hives.
21226	4	a	An unpretentiously sweet home-is-where-the-heart-is fantasy.
21227	4	a	We can forgive the silly setup, without which there can be no film, but like many a road movie, this one has a better start and finish than middle.
21228	4	a	The Edge, more of a drama than the action/thriller it's being billed as, exhibits a restrained literateness that's quite effective.
21229	4	a	"Mostly contrived comedy/drama, although the ""truth in advertising"" campaign is hilarious."
21230	4	a	...something I'd want my preteen children to see before they get too much more sophisticated.
21231	6	a	There are individual nice moments, to be sure, but it holds less than half the laughs of its predecessor and gives that picture's secret-weapon standout Rose Byrne disappointingly little to do.
21232	2	a	Engagingly raunchy, but strip Apatow's films of their vulgarity and they'd warm the heart of a Production Code censor from a half century ago.
21233	0	a	... this is a film with its own cadence, its own particular sense of music, and it is a tremendous success for writer/director David O. Russell.
21234	4	a	It's just an earnest tribute, tastefully faithful to the source -- and flatter, somehow, than the story ever was on the page.
21235	6	a	Despite its many shortcomings, Amistad has the energy and earnestness of most Spielberg pictures.
21236	4	a	A new generation of kids gets its John Hughes on...surprisingly bearable.
21237	3	a	It's about time Warner Bros. revived Bugs. He was the most irreverent, intelligent, sophisticated and appealing cartoon character ever to defy gravity.
21238	4	a	Brilliantly acted, and possibly the most tasteful romance ever filmed, but so relentlessly elegant that it's a little suffocating.
21239	6	a	This film can be valued for its energetic performances.
21240	5	a	If you love to cry at movies - you know who you are - don't bring a hankie to The Light Between Oceans. Supply yourself instead with a roll of toilet paper, then thread it on a spindle in the drink holder.
21241	2	a	...one of those pictures where the journey is more important than the destination.
21242	5	a	Wilson is the most intolerable of all. Watching him slack his way through this movie made me feel like Lou Dobbs. I didn't like Dupree. I wanted him deported.
21243	0	a	This is a full-blooded, joyous, intelligent celebration of a beloved cultural icon, with Daniel Craig taking full possession of a role he previously played unconvincingly.
21244	6	a	Neither very credible nor one of those beyond-belief disposables you still find affable.
21245	3	a	There's no denying that his bravura performance, both in front of the camera and behind it, is spellbindingly effective.
21246	2	a	Unlike other Holocaust films, in which good and evil are always clearly delineated, Nelson has found a grey zone of ambiguous morality.
21247	2	a	The drugs, some sex and a lot of pulse-pounding sounds all likely will suggest more to those of us who went ga-ga over their first grand go-round than to movie-goers making Boyle's wild Scottish scene for the first time. 
21248	7	a	There's a surprising lack of craftsmanship in the true-life ballet drama Mao's Last Dancer, enough to practically negate what should be a powerful story
21249	1	a	[Adams has] got a wild-eyed spark that suggests she's probably game for just about anything. I hope Hollywood doesn't sand her down too much and turn her into a bland star.
21250	6	a	The film's only suspense was whether or not the would-be priest would yield to the temptations of the flesh.
21251	6	a	DeLillo's brilliant analysis of the destructive power of wealth that took such seductive hold on page has a tough time gaining traction on screen.
21252	0	a	Unapologetic and hard-hitting, Irvine Welsh's controversial bestseller is brought to the screen as a dazzling assault on the senses.
21253	9	a	Unfunny action comedy wastes great cast; violence, language. 
21254	0	a	The entirety of human existence in two short years, all of it brought to life in an extraordinary motion picture that's absolutely impossible to forget.
21255	3	a	The actors make it new and poignant, and avoid going over the top in the story's limited psychic and physical space. Even at their highest pitch, the emotions of these characters come from hearts long worn down by the troubles we see.
21256	3	a	Veering from comedy to moving tragedy to a bittersweet ending, TALK TO ME captures the spirit of a man and the times in which he lived. It may not be a masterpiece, but it's pretty damned close.
21257	6	a	The film fumbles its lame narrative and, although some of MacFarlane's jokes are hilarious, they're just blips on the radar.
21258	9	a	full review at Movies for the Masses
21259	7	a	"In spite of the admirable effort that the Wayans brothers went to in digitally transplanting Marlon Wayans head and facial expressions onto the two-foot-six-inch body of a nine-year-old actor, ""Little Man"" is a bawdy and violent comedy that rankles more t"
21260	4	a	Enchanted still provides a pleasant twist on Walt Disney's traditional output and has enough decent performances from its cast to raise titters and smiles from even the most grumpy movie-goers.
21261	3	a	The reality of Alzheimer's may be even harsher than its presentation here but that would surely make a film that would only dismay its viewers.
21262	8	a	So we have a light comedy full of racial slurs and cripple jokes where the hero hunts down the mass-murderer who killed his parents.
21263	0	a	it informs everything we know today about watching movies.
21264	1	a	While Albert Bassermann earned a Best Supporting Actor Oscar nomination for a somewhat hammy turn, the best performance comes from George Sanders, atypically cast as a fearless and resourceful hero rather than the cads and scoundrels he generally played.
21265	6	a	You, Me and Dupree is pleasant, likable and warm, but it forgot to pack the funny.
21266	3	a	...captivating and provocative in its exquisite spirit. The Passion of the Christ is an ambitious and visceral undertaking that demands acceptance.
21267	4	a	It succeeds in making the viewer wish for the images of real people on the screen instead of fake ones.
21268	3	a	This delightful follow-up to The Addams Family is blessed with an even blacker vein of humour than the original.
21269	0	a	"One brilliant, funny and generous film that exists somewhere between ""Siddhartha"" and Sid Caesar. "
21270	2	a	The Artist is vibrant. It is clever and dramatic, and has a rich treasure trove of cinema lore and vitality. The Artist captures the eternal wonder of movies -- new and old.
21271	0	a	Brilliant, provocative, clear of eye and heavy of heart...
21272	1	a	Garcia keeps his various stories flowing and in perfect balance.
21273	3	a	This is a very interesting film and is also successful as a headlong roller-coaster ride of a pure action film.
21274	3	a	Internal Affairs delivers what it promises, and perhaps a little more. There's less action but more menace, and the pulse quickens as the plot drives relentlessly toward a conclusion that, in retrospect, can be seen as inevitable.
21275	4	a	A gentle and largely enjoyable way to tell a story, but also one that never leaves much of an impression.
21276	2	a	Five times better than it should have been.
21277	4	a	A wonderful Western spoof. Marvin great in dual role; drags at times, but mostly a hoot.
21278	2	a	As good as the performances are, I found the screenplay and Rodrigo Garcia's direction tonally inconsistent. The unusual premise seems to be played at some moments for laughs and at other times with heavy-handed solemnity.
21279	3	a	"Still Alice"" provides a valuable lesson in empathy and understanding, with a message for all of us in accepting what we've lost, and celebrating what hasn't yet gone. "
21280	3	a	"...while his ""War's"" waging, Spielberg will have you by the throat. "
21281	1	a	"Even the most amazing of the great Pixar films could be tagged with the label of ""antiseptic."" No one would use that for Totoro, which, especially if seen under optimum conditions, astounds with its vibrancy."
21282	1	a	It captures the smack and wit of Peter Shaffer's stage play.
21283	1	a	Excellent visuals, a tenderly told tale, laughs aplenty, and a positive social message to boot.
21284	5	a	Nascimento's penchant for Rambo theatrics is unfortunate, because elsewhere Elite Squad has interesting things to say.
21285	0	a	[Fincher] never abandons his meticulousness -- it's what allows him to position you in the exact right spot to deliver the blow. 
21286	3	a	a grand adventure told with beauty, charm, and cinematic grace
21287	5	a	It's soppy stuff, not nearly funny enough, and Lily Collins' sterling efforts are mainly in vain.
21288	1	a	Zhao's film derives its power from the truth that both drives it and inspires it, and the final result is a wholly unique slice-of-life drama.
21289	3	a	There's no judgment here, just acknowledging that being a teenager is tough -- and doing so with a grin.
21290	4	a	A sweet and mildly funny movie that will entertain young audiences, but one aspect is utterly mystifying: The two main characters, father and son bovine creatures, have large, distracting udders.
21291	6	a	Empire of the Sun wants very badly to be a great film, though as Steven Spielberg really ought to know by now, wishing doesn't make it so.
21292	3	a	It all leads to a very strange place, and I'm particularly impressed with the economical means, both financially and artistically, by which Aronofsky gets there.
21293	9	a	Strange Wilderness is a never-ending bundle of self-consciously raunchy skits aimed at under-achieving slackers who are too high to notice how desperately pathetic it all is.
21294	3	a	A romantic comedy that's easy to fall in love with.
21295	3	a	A graceful, intelligent movie, and one that gives Casey Affleck a chance to really shine.
21296	2	a	The result, though refreshingly different from mainstream animated fare, is ultimately more trick than treat.
21297	6	a	"Pleasantville"" starts with an interesting premise but unfortunately, Gary Ross directs his film into a marshmallow-coated, undemanding feature instead of really trying to be daring."
21298	5	a	You can't help thinking Anthony Hopkins would eat this kid for breakfast.
21299	4	a	The quintessential cotton candy movie: It's pleasant, brightly colored and the minute it's done it's as though it were never there.
21300	5	a	Mr. Miller and his assorted virtuosos are killers when it comes to making jive, but it takes more than wind and willingness to support a ninety-seven-minute film.
21301	2	a	A solid slice of gross-out gratuity and saddle sore scatology
21302	5	a	Disappointing action flick centers on terrorism.
21303	3	a	Under Stanton's care 'John Carter' is the kind of tremendous fun-filled film that's worth going to the theater to see.
21304	6	a	Benning is unrecognisable in the role, breathing life in to a heightened, borderline otherworldly character - and leaving you wishing director Paul McGuigan would equally be able to breathe life in to the rest of his pedestrian picture.
21305	0	a	Rises above convention with some fantastic acting and a careful layering of supernatural rumblings and clue-gathering that makes for a compelling two hours.
21306	5	a	What happens when satire gets lazy.
21307	2	a	An elegant balance between light and dark, The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo benefits from Fincher's ascetic treatment, and will silence any of the naysayers who felt the whole American version was little more than a money grab.
21308	0	a	Filled with intriguing layers, the story of Kane's life becomes an onion that the movie keeps peeling.
21309	3	a	This will be remembered as one of Cage's finest performances. Maybe he has just needed the right director and in eccentric German genius Werner Herzog he's found him.
21310	4	a	This intense action thriller will be recalled for its exciting visuals and relentless action rather than its acting.
21311	0	a	A cruelly cynical take on the seamy side of New York City's swinging nightclub life.
21312	6	a	"Larry Crowne"" is made precisely for people like Larry Crowne."
21313	1	a	A compelling, thought-provoking, and unsettling drama.
21314	6	a	The movie devolves into a routine rip-off of Death Wish.
21315	1	a	Every once in a while a film will come around that no one has heard of and as a critic I want to scream at the top of my lungs to the entire world for everyone to go see it.
21316	4	a	Not bad adventure, nothing special, but not bad
21317	4	a	Shows that even in a supposedly 'tidy town,' people still experience things and make decisions that can only be justified by saying, 'Well, you had to be there.'
21318	3	a	This is prime Woody Allen -- insightful, philosophical and very funny.
21319	6	a	It is an insult to the viewer in every single way imaginable, so destructively manipulative it makes everything that happens next nearly unwatchable.
21320	3	a	Your heart will break, your head will swoon, and you will hope against hope for a happy ending that history will not permit.
21321	3	a	More of an abstract than trick, Stay is a satisfying examination.
21322	9	a	With Masters of the Universe -- the latest numbskull entertainment from the creators of Castle Greyskull -- He-Man makes the transition from animation to live action. Taking a live actor along for the ride might have helped.
21323	7	a	Why on earth anyone would want to waste a summer matinee afternoon with Hancock when they could get wasted with Shakes the Clown in the DVD privacy of their own lair?
21324	3	a	This portrait of Nim probably tells us a lot more about human behavior than it does about the chimp at its center, also offering sociological perspectives over the changing times.
21325	6	a	"The first half of ""Taking Woodstock"" is wonderful. Unfortunately, the tone becomes more serious and the pacing meanders in the second half."
21326	4	a	...while it is little more than a lightweight charade masquerading as deep wisdom, there were parts of it I enjoyed.
21327	6	a	The predictably heavy metal-scored film's primary directive is to recreate the mindless mayhem of its joystick-controlled roots.
21328	5	a	"Everything about Benson Lee's predictable dance flick ""Battle of the Year"" strikes me as old."
21329	0	a	I continue to be utterly taken with Midnight in Paris. 
21330	4	a	Both exhilarating and exhausting, it falls just short of a fever pitch.
21331	2	a	The only way to completely and totally enjoy Christopher Robin is to not think about the Disney corporation.
21332	4	a	People who have never seen a movie using this gimmick may be impressed, but for those who have - or can see it coming - there isn't very much point.
21333	3	a	In compact, economical form, DuVernay sets out her table: the juxtaposition of domestic intimacy and institutional violence; the tension between the personal and political; the vivid interplay between the historical and the contemporary.
21334	9	a	Various articles describe Tim and Eric's style as 'avant garde' but we remain unconvinced.
21335	7	a	Aside from the James Franco cameo, this story is one disappointment after another. 
21336	0	a	Very funny. Very unique. Much needed after the crap I've seen this summer.
21337	5	a	Lots of character cameos, witty genre in-jokes, and a heaping of heart from its main characters.
21338	3	a	It's not the masterpiece people have been claiming, but Eastwood does set up a gripping moody atmosphere and get some fine performances out of his actors.
21339	4	a	The film takes several surprising turns and evolves into a decent thriller. Still, the script by Alison Cross and Nick Villiers too often gets mired in its own material.
21340	4	a	Australian director Bruce Beresford handles the culture-clash aspects of the story with a surprising lack of subtlety.
21341	3	a	You can't help but walk out feeling as though you've just seen one of the more important stories about one of the more important people - gay or straight - of our time.
21342	5	a	Hancock can fly; Hancock can punch; Hancock is bulletproof. Regrettably these things don't hold true for Hancock as a film, which starts promisingly enough, but ultimately gets knocked off course by a reveal of dubious dramatic value.
21343	3	a	Hysterically potent, thought-provoking and deliciously nostalgic. Overall, the proposed chatter is warranted in the movingly impish Talk to Me.
21344	3	a	One of the better films I've seen all year.
21345	7	a	insipid... your time would be better spent staring at the stars
21346	4	a	If you're looking solely for visual thrills, go for a real IMAX film, not an ersatz substitute.
21347	3	a	Graff ... mines some spunky humor and heartfelt characters, all while coloring safely within the lines of the underdogs-reaching-the-top storyline.
21348	4	a	Black Snake Moan is thick with Tennessee sweat and grit and the sound of insects. And it takes an overwrought, steamy path to what at least feels like a moral cautionary tale.
21349	6	a	This is a movie that goes nowhere and offers up little in the way of originality, and while the majority of it is technically well presented the boredom I felt while watching it was almost enough to put me to sleep.
21350	1	a	This acerbic, darkly poetic Coen brothers' take on the Cormac McCarthy novel is calculated to give you the willies.
21351	1	a	The Nightmare Before Christmas is perhaps the first movie that is delightfully horrible, gruesomely sweet and wholesome.
21352	4	a	We've seen it all before.
21353	6	a	"It felt like I was being smothered with ""feel good"" moments. Everything about the story and its characters is too far detached from reality."
21354	3	a	An intoxicating and endlessly surprising portrait of forbidden passion.
21355	4	a	It's constructed to induce kinky shudders, delivering them with the ghoulish technical flair of a purring master.
21356	3	a	It seems that each narrative element of the film is arranged to make us connect with nature. [Full review in Spanish]
21357	3	a	A movie that's all about atmosphere over story, the sets and the gothic tone are the main characters here. [Full review in Spanish]
21358	1	a	Flightplan delivers a frightening thriller with an airtight plot.
21359	1	a	Beautiful in practically every way, Carol is a touchingly romantic triumph.
21360	0	a	The film that enchanted a generation and made Ford an action hero.
21361	3	a	More concerned with Sade's ideas than with his actions. The movie achieves as great an impact by keeping these thoughts hidden as... [Quills] did by showing them.
21362	9	a	Payneful
21363	2	a	Consistently funny and, as it builds to its conclusion, also very sweet fun.
21364	3	a	An unforgettable film and one of the year's best.
21365	4	a	The only reason to watch this film is to see some of the world's most famous action stars returning for one last bout of mayhem.
21366	4	a	If this sort of thing bores you, you may want to give it a chance anyway because Christopher Walken ... makes his Hollywood film debut.
21367	1	a	The Rider is art imitating life in one of the best ways. Because the main characters are not trained actors, the film benefits and it produces a story that is heart-wrenching, unfiltered and intimate.
21368	7	a	It's basically 'Stand by Me' for dummies. And I'm betting even the 'dummies' will get wise fast to the fact that the only throne 'Kings' is worthy of sitting upon is constructed of porcelain. 
21369	2	a	An actors' showcase for its iconic duo...and both have grown impressively since they last swooned shipside.
21370	1	a	A hilariously fun romp through the everyday lives of comic-book superheroes.
21371	2	a	Its bleak tale was lightly delivered and filled with a wry Scottish wit and a poignant social realism that rang true.
21372	9	a	dramatically inert
21373	6	a	Dear Fat Seth Rogen, I miss you. 
21374	1	a	Ava DuVernay's Selma is good as you've heard. It's delicious as well as nutritious.
21375	3	a	Most impressive, though, is the film's open-ended finale that refuses to entirely close its characters' emotional wounds.
21376	4	a	Who's been murdering newlyweds, turning a beachy paradise into a tropical hell shared by three pretty couples? You'll probably guess, but that doesn't take away from the slicked-up genre charms of this A Perfect Getaway.
21377	6	a	It's the first time either Jordan or Bugs has had a starring role on the big screen. It's gimmicky Saturday-morning cartoon wackiness in your face -- funny, but brain-deadening.
21378	4	a	A lot of painstaking work went into this . . . Unfortunately, the main story becomes nearly incomprehensible . . . and the last ten minutes or so just feel like drudgery.
21379	5	a	Falls far short of Breaking the Waves in nearly every way -- in uneven performances, an implausible narrative, its shallow emotional resonance.
21380	3	a	I think this is a really good film. You've got to admire Steve Coogan for the projects he takes on. 
21381	4	a	Sausage Party won't fill you up with laughs, but there are some amusing dishes being served, thought up by Rogen and friends likely while getting baked good.
21382	1	a	It's also a heartfelt film, with nice messages about friendship and responsibility...
21383	6	a	With a more intelligent and taut screenplay, Valkyrie could have been much more riveting rather than merely be sporadically thrilling, mostly bland and, ultimately, underwhelming.
21384	1	a	Fincher directs this chaotic fable with grace, urgency, and knockout stylistics.
21385	5	a	Secret Things loses that narrative midway through.
21386	6	a	Unless your dreams are populated by denizens of Middle Earth, endless footage of them simply talking or walking is a lot less spectacular than Peter Jackson thinks it is.
21387	1	a	For the second film in a row, Marsh has created a movie we can't keep our eyes off.
21388	6	a	Amazingly performed and with a great photography but relatively insipid. [Full review in Spanish]
21389	3	a	Croatian filmmaker Goran Dukic's debut feature turns out to be a sweetly grim lark: a road film through Limbo.
21390	0	a	Black's comedic timing and acting makes him a perfect fit for portraying the outlandishly peculiar uncle. Blanchett's poise and grace, paired with her adept and nuanced acting, bring what could have been a dull character to technicolor life.
21391	6	a	Thriller and action elements are low-scale and unsuccessful. Valkyrie is little more than a sketchy and narrow history lesson with less impact than it should have.
21392	1	a	A fascinating meditation on inner turmoil in which doing the right thing can lead down many wrong directions.
21393	6	a	Jindabyne ends up shushing itself out of any emotional wallop. Restraint is a necessity if you're trying to express Carver's singular voice, but there's a difference between being quietly devastating and muting your narrative to death.
21394	5	a	Stay, it won't.
21395	3	a	Robinson's Simon is a revelation, his hooded eyes suggesting they see a lot more than they let on, while the charismatic Shipp steals all of her scenes as a student with her own demons. 
21396	4	a	Despite the inexcusable lack of a DeLorean, Teen Wolf is a modest, digestible comedy, guided by a perfectly itchy Fox performance as the titular beast. 
21397	9	a	What I miss most of all is the absence of the late, great Mel Blanc.
21398	3	a	Besides closing on a downbeat final note - as opposed to Shaun and Fuzz's ebullient endings - this is a good old time at the movies, the kind only a born filmmaker can provide. 
21399	3	a	Where there's demand, there's supply, and this franchise will shoot up the box office chart because it's undemanding and fiercely electrifying entertainment.
21400	4	a	Jackie Chan has his best American movie role so far as Chon Wang.
21401	3	a	the great turkey hunter creates a long lasting character along with the other Vernon residents
21402	10	a	Garbage. A bad excuse for a movie, even for the pulpy disposable popcorn nonsense it wants to be. Incoherent and illogical, cheap and shoddy. Wannabe sci-fi action horror that can't pull off any of it.
21403	6	a	Whom is this movie for, really? It's too tame for the whooping crowds of women who made hits of the Sex and the City movies and Bridesmaids. And for sure it isn't for parents with kids.
21404	3	a	It isn't quite summer-movie season yet, but Fast Five is already peeling down to its proverbial, sweat-sodden muscle shirt in preparation. It's ready for anything.
21405	4	a	It's cute, it's passable, the animation is fine--but the major problem with the film is its predictability.
21406	5	a	After traveling to Eden with the shallow, self-involved, unpleasant twits that populate Couples Retreat, you'll be wishing they'd all have packed their bags and gone straight to hell, instead.
21407	3	a	Sometimes the little things are worth the price of admission.
21408	3	a	A heavenly delight.
21409	7	a	The musty odor of a fossil hangs over the whole enterprise
21410	3	a	The MVP is Jay Chou as Kato, who is as much Britt Reid's superior as the valet Jeeves and the dog Gromit are superior to their alleged 'masters' in the works of P.G. Wodehouse and Nick Park.
21411	2	a	What makes Owen Wilson a special exception is that his characters always work to make the world more child-like and whimsical, and the films brighten up as a result.
21412	4	a	Much like I feel in the voting booth every four years, the political satire American Dreamz rendered me frustrated and confused.
21413	4	a	It is of higher class than any made for TV melodrama but falls short of being the next Steel Magnolias or Awakenings. Great actors do what they can in a simple and largely unaffecting story.
21414	3	a	"Nebraska"" is a slice of Americana that is amusing but also quite poignant."
21415	2	a	Laughter through tears is director Bill Duke's M.O., and he hits the bull's-eye of that modest target.
21416	5	a	Overblown and dull, it's not surprising that this film is largely forgotten.
21417	4	a	The film walks a fine line here, delivering enough frightening moments to qualify as a thriller-comedy, while also creating enough drama and character development to let adult chaperones feel they're watching an actual movie. 
21418	3	a	Ross' direction is decent, and he gets fine work from all the principal actors.
21419	8	a	For some reason, Disney keeps making really, really crappy live-action films.
21420	4	a	[Director] Tyrnauer and the movie seem blinded by Valentino's stardom and start to lose their way. As a result, the documentary is unfocused.
21421	9	a	[A] dark, violent, nerve-wracking, trigger-giddy waste of time.
21422	6	a	Alas, terrific tunes can only carry a motion picture so far, and the material in between them is scattershot at best.
21423	3	a	"All in all, ""American Hustle"" is a fun ride - while it lasts."
21424	1	a	SKYFALL returns to basics. The plot and economical but riveting action sequences are secondary to the film's cinematography, direction, acting and writing.
21425	9	a	A depressing film that celebrates brute strength as the only means to stem the tide of violence and crime in Rio de Janeiro.
21426	0	a	Now, that's what I call entertainment.
21427	3	a	An entertaining comedy that far surpasses his previous American films.
21428	4	a	There's lots to love here, particularly Michael Caine's deadly straight take on Scrooge.
21429	5	a	Possesses little of the snap or charisma of the films that inspired it.
21430	0	a	Dark and darkly funny celebration of music's power to transform us. GOODFELLAS meets DREAMGIRLS.
21431	6	a	If you've seen the trailer, you've seen only half the movie -- and all the jokes.
21432	0	a	... Call Me By Your Name can only be described as a perfect film.
21433	2	a	Vardalos is great as Toula and presents her character's traits and peculiarities fittingly well.
21434	5	a	Writer-director Darnell Martin regularly twists or obscures the truth, without illuminating characters beyond superficialities.
21435	3	a	Corbijn confidently keeps the balance between the larger cat-and-mouse game and Bachmann's own, personal risk; the movie's final moment may haunt you for some time.
21436	5	a	Frequently feels as if it has been assembled in some strange parallel world, one where Johnny Depp and Angelina Jolie possess none of the charisma or subversive appeal that has consistently made each of them a magnetic screen presence...
21437	4	a	The characters are wonderfully well played by Nick Nolte Sissy Spacek and John Heard -- they have scenes together in which the round-robin of everyday dialogue is almost poetic -- but nobody has given their characters anything to do except to be.
21438	4	a	If The Prestige is something of a let down as a magic trick, it's more successful as a tale of obsession.
21439	2	a	From Dusk Till Dawn is an hilarious piece of genre filmmaking.
21440	3	a	"As the kids discover their powers and this family hovers between super and dysfunctional, ""The Incredibles"" finds its voice . . . and it speaks to families everywhere."
21441	4	a	Sincerely spiritual and inspirational, turning the movie theater into a church and preaching to the choir.
21442	2	a	The first third of this film can seem like a downer, but the performances are absorbing and in no time at all it takes an inspirational, feel-good turn.
21443	3	a	Urbane yet never too serious, and beautifully shot by Roger Deakins, this all seems a good fit for director Sam Mendes, who's made his career imposing a sort of British pretense on American movies.
21444	4	a	This is a film that tackles some big themes: religion, sex, ethnic conflict, the meaning of life and death. It's also a crude burlesque about talking food items who swear a lot more than they really need to.
21445	4	a	I give De Palma and company credit for not succumbing to the usual bloat we see in big-budget Hollywood films.
21446	6	a	Like most modern fantasies, The Santa Clause isn't very clear about the rules governing Scott's new powers.
21447	1	a	The Passion of the Christ, while not a perfect film, will touch many emotions in those who see it. Some people may be offended, while others may be inspired. 
21448	5	a	Might at first look like proper cinema red in tooth and claw, but underneath it's a bundle of matted fleece and bleating.
21449	3	a	A melancholic film that will inevitably evoke this singular restlessness of the first love. [Full review in Spanish]
21450	3	a	More than anything, Astro Boy is simply fun to watch.
21451	3	a	Avoids the usual biopic stuffiness by concentrating on one major event in Dr. King's life, the march in Selma, Alabama.
21452	5	a	The dregs of early December are upon us, and Martin Campbell's excruciating rescue effort up the world's second highest peak has tripped and fallen.
21453	2	a	"A futuristic take on ""Pinocchio""... a competently-made animated adventure that probably will wow kids more than it will keep adults entertained for more than a few minutes."
21454	1	a	Go in blind, and let it gobsmack you into euphoria.
21455	3	a	Antal proudly wears Tarantino influences, lingering in humorous conversations that race out on tangents, adding flavor to characters while also subtly developing themes.
21456	4	a	The dialogue in general is a notch above the norm, snappy and tight and remarkably unlike the drivel these things usually have.
21457	1	a	Desolation accomplished. 
21458	6	a	Performances, the story's historical origins, and the inherent goodness and contemporaneity of its storyline make Focus a movie worth viewing.
21459	1	a	Midnight in Paris is a very unselfish and lovely approach to inspiration, love, and the written word. A must watch.
21460	3	a	A dressmaker seeking vindication drives this dark dramedy. Kate Winslet delivers an outstanding performance as the determined seamstress. Also in fine form is Hugo Weaving as a quirky, cross-dressing police sergeant. A perfect fit for awards season. 
21461	6	a	The plot is preposterous. So what you need is a movie that floats with bemusement above the cockamamie, and actors who tease each other.
21462	3	a	Darker, scarier and somewhat better than Sorcerer's Stone.
21463	4	a	A film that dares contemplate some huge themes, Agora shines light on a charming and neglected historical figure, but gets a little lost in trying to do too much aside from what ought to be its main focus.
21464	6	a	Having the talent of Laura Linney and Philip Seymour Hoffman isn't enough.
21465	4	a	...suffers from more than one kind of Southern drawl.
21466	3	a	When John Carter moves up the gears it's an accomplished blockbuster packed with pulse-racing action.
21467	4	a	The strain is showing in this third entry, with too many of the characters placed in developmental holding patterns and too much of the storyline given over to daft contrivances.
21468	2	a	While Ralph Breaks The Internet brilliantly tackles issues of insecurity, friendship, the courage to take chances and chasing one's dreams, certain messages in the movie are not so ideal.
21469	3	a	This is Sienna Miller's chance to prove she can do more in a movie than look good while naked, and it turns out she's a good actress.
21470	6	a	This dramatization of a true story is long on sentiment, short on character and drama.
21471	6	a	"An average at best affair that could have been more if it's running time were less and attempt at enlightenment ""MacFarlane style"" abandoned."
21472	4	a	Diary of a Wimpy Kid, based on the popular illustrated tween books by Jeff Kinney, deserves a B- for effort and a C for execution.
21473	5	a	How heartening that a mainstream studio flick could have a gay protagonist. How disappointing that said flick is as twee and anodyne as this.
21474	0	a	This is an erotic and mesmerizing movie that exemplifies cinematic artistry in scope, theme, and tone. 
21475	6	a	Next Friday is sloppily assembled, with virtually no plot and absolutely no character development. But it's funny.
21476	8	a	The question has never been whether 'Citizen Kane' is one of the greatest films ever made. The question is whether it is THE greatest.
21477	3	a	Combining the elements of comedy and thriller isn't easy, especially for a first-timer. But Ebiri pulls it off.
21478	6	a	Doesn't live up to expectations. [Full review in Spanish]
21479	5	a	This is a mess of unconvincing characters, doolally plotting and dumb flag-waving - the one honest character being an Iraq vet forced to join the others in their brain-dead scam.
21480	7	a	In the end, Rock the Kasbah isn't so much offensive as it is painfully boring.
21481	0	a	Martin Short gives as much energy and flair to this film as Robin Williams did to Aladdin and Eddie Murphy did to Mulan. He is a pure joy to watch and will make you laugh out loud on several occasions.
21482	3	a	While You Were Sleeping may not be a film for the ages. It likely won't even rank among the presummer season's biggest hits. But it is worth noting, for it may mark the birth of a star.
21483	2	a	If you were Nora Prentiss, would you keep your mouth shut?
21484	4	a	It may not be a great drama or a great whodunit, but it's certainly entertaining.
21485	2	a	A lovely, evocative film...[but] Coppola insulates her depiction of Bob and Charlotte as earnest, delicate souls by making everyone else look pretty foolish.
21486	6	a	It's like an art-house 'Human Centipede.' While it hints at some interesting ideas, it just comes down to a crazy doctor.
21487	4	a	Strangely uneven but Philip Seymour Hoffman is a le Carre natural. 
21488	4	a	Adults might find the movie on the slight side, though it's a good choice for family night viewing.
21489	6	a	Mazer, a Sacha Baron Cohen collaborator, directs this comedy without much snap, crackle or pop.
21490	2	a	It chronicles one of the most dramatic of all spaceflights, an American catastrophe that became an American victory, and it does this in a way that's so authentic, so brilliant in its technical details, that it succeeds in putting us on that ship.
21491	2	a	The beauty in the film is in the natural way the slight story evolves...
21492	1	a	If this story must be told and retold -- and indeed it must -- then The Grey Zone is to be lauded for finding a new and ingenious angle.
21493	3	a	However you view it, it's a story that's been told before. And yet, it works.
21494	4	a	For better or worse - often both - Cosmopolis is a quintessential David Cronenberg film. Cosmopolis is simultaneously fascinating and impenetrable, profound and absurd, labyrinthine yet intimate.
21495	3	a	A gruesome, helpless spiral barely saved by an actress locating humanity where few would have cared to bother.
21496	1	a	Team America might sound like a backyard enterprise, but this highly detailed motion picture could stand proudly alongside any blockbuster.
21497	4	a	A well-acted, family-friendly comedy...
21498	9	a	Poorly animated and barely scripted, this is the worst in an endless line of computer-animated movies starring animals this year.
21499	4	a	An engrossing but disappointing big-budget political suspense film, that never becomes exceptional.
21500	3	a	the film tried a little too hard to make the audience squirm -- but it also forced me to think.
21501	10	a	Best friends may make the best mistakes, but Madonna makes the absolute worst, at least in terms of her film career.
21502	1	a	An odd, but mostly effective mix of melodrama, fantasy and voice-over.
21503	3	a	A lovely movie, one that allows its characters unexpected spurts of growth and regression, darkness and grace.
21504	5	a	Cop Land is a movie that seems to have either too many subplots or not enough editing. It is either way too long or too short, depending on what it was meant to be in the first place.
21505	1	a	Easily positions [James] Marsh at the forefront of contemporary non-fiction filmmaking.
21506	4	a	But despite the great chemistry between the two leads and the sparkling performance by Bening, the film doesn't contain the same passion as its subjects.
21507	3	a	Director Eli Roth has turned in a charming slice of cinema that should become a Halloween staple for many children going forward. 
21508	5	a	The storytelling is all rather flat, as is the lighting. And the duel, when it finally comes, is something of an anticlimax.
21509	3	a	Strong, stirring, triumphant and tragic, The Imitation Game may be about a man who changed the world, but it's also about the world that destroyed a man.
21510	3	a	...a laugh-filled, foul-mouthed road film...
21511	9	a	Currish...the film's niche audience is indiscriminate aging dog lovers; people lovers should look elsewhere. 
21512	2	a	Field keeps both hands firmly on the wheel as Doris, skillfully maneuvering through both the comedic and dramatic scenes like the two-time Oscar winner that she is.
21513	3	a	You might want to have a beer after you see 'The World's End,' the latest from the creative team of Simon Pegg, Nick Frost and Edgar Wright.
21514	5	a	"What starts off as a serious examination of mental illness turns into an entirely different movie, one with nearly the exact same third act as ""High School Musical."" "
21515	3	a	"Infiltrator"" Not Quite Invasive Enough"
21516	6	a	"When the dead come back to life and start chewing on the living it all comes flooding back. These heroes should have remembered ""Dawn of the Dead"
21517	9	a	This ugly and rather mean-spirited film, with jokes that are so lowbrow they're totally underfoot, creaks through a number of recycled road trip gags.
21518	0	a	With a roster of memorable characters, a cast on universally great form and a script that is frequently capable of wrong-footing its audience, there's really very little to complain about.
21519	2	a	a gleeful demonstration of Antal's flair for the medium
21520	3	a	Bruce Robinson's Hollywood debut is much better than generally thought
21521	0	a	It pulled me in with its friendly, inclusive, nonjudgmental appraisal of human nature.
21522	4	a	Introducing new generations to an infamous historical incident, this drama takes a detailed, matter-of-fact approach; while the result isn't exactly stirring, it's at least consistently interesting.
21523	3	a	Death finds gloriously grisly new ways to deal with teenagers who dare to spit in his face.
21524	4	a	[Karamakate is] a frankly great character in a thoroughly gripping film.
21525	5	a	Hanging Up has all the ingredients of a success -- a stellar cast, a promising premise, a strong production team -- but nothing comes together in satisfying fashion.
21526	1	a	Completely uncompromising in a way that films, especially sports films, just aren't.
21527	1	a	A string of non-stop humor.
21528	3	a	[De Aranoa is] a gentle, realist social worker, and the well-acted movie he's made to showcase his humanism is incredibly moving.
21529	1	a	Call Me By Your Name's erotic tension wouldn't crackle so loudly without the chemistry between its leads.
21530	4	a	In some ways it's beyond criticism as the first-ever major movie about this heroic campaigner.
21531	1	a	Selma is a passionate and utterly important historical recounting, unimpeachable for its modern relevancy, and moving in its cinematic telling.
21532	7	a	The plot, as it were, is a series of coincidences combined with extreme leaps of faith and a trifecta of stupid cell phone tricks
21533	4	a	The docudrama comes off as neither a hatchet job nor a whitewash, while Curran's measured, unhurried direction infuses a feeling of authenticity. 
21534	10	a	[A] completely idiotic, excruciatingly dull potboiler.
21535	3	a	A film like this always raises the question of whether newcomers can enjoy it, as they are unarmed with an understanding of the characters' histories and all the references that are surely contained within the screenplay. In this case, the answer is yes.
21536	3	a	A gripping ensemble piece, good-humoured even at the end of its tether.
21537	4	a	This meandering melodrama is too fractured, too soap opera-ish and is just too odd ... even by the Oscar-winning, Spanish filmmaker's usual standards.
21538	0	a	It has the power to haunt the skeptical, to mystify the credulous and to fascinate everyone in between...
21539	6	a	Eric Bana is absolutely Fabio-lous ... ready to burst from the cover of a romance novel at any moment.
21540	3	a	Cameron Crowe remains, as always, uncool. And wonderful for it. 'We Bought A Zoo' is lovely, delicate, and absolutely worth seeing with your family this holiday season.
21541	5	a	A forgettable bit of fluff that will zip out of your orbit as soon as the credits roll.
21542	1	a	Resembles classics like Hawks' Scarface, Walsh's White Heat, and any of a handful of James Cagney or Edward G. Robinson gangster films.
21543	5	a	Despite the fine efforts of Harris and Gooding, Jr., Radio nearly drowns in James Horner's overbearingly sentimental music.
21544	9	a	Valkyrie is like having to watch someone build a bomb and then never getting to see it explode.
21545	5	a	This is the yawning of the Age of Aquarius.
21546	1	a	Demme keeps his quirky narrative twisting and turning so that the viewer can never predict what will happen next.
21547	2	a	Cameron Crowe casts a heart-warming cinematic spell that will milk many a tear from its widespread target audience. 
21548	5	a	Just because The Soloist is about a homeless person doesn't mean it should have pedestrian direction. But it does -- pedestrian and clodhopping.
21549	0	a	A difficult film to describe without making it seem less than the masterpiece it is, 'Tokyo Story' is a remarkable work that gives a real insight into family life.
21550	1	a	From start to finish, it is a well-crafted film: part love story, part mystery, and all drama.
21551	6	a	The Beast Within is an above-average monster movie with good actors and a sometimes comprehensible plot. 
21552	4	a	Relentlessly uneven yet basically entertaining...
21553	2	a	The plot and themes don't really measure up but it is fun, largely because of the matter-of-fact brand of wit dispensed by Blanchett and Black and the young fogeyish appeal of Vaccaro's Lewis.
21554	6	a	Like an Afterschool Special on steroids.
21555	2	a	Craig may not always get the details right, but her larger vision -- alternately pitiless and forgiving of teenage foibles in the midst of adolescence -- is still bracing. And the performances she encourages from her actors help pick up the slack.
21556	3	a	A bighearted, uplifting and captivating drama for all ages. It will inspire you to open your heart compassionately and to find hope, faith and comfort throughout your life's hardships.
21557	6	a	The bawdy bear is back in this flagrantly fumbling sequel - and it's disappointingly un-funny.
21558	4	a	If you've ever installed a v-chip in your family tellie, Land of the Dead may not be for you
21559	4	a	Freaky fairy tale has fluffy story line, fantastic visuals.
21560	4	a	Conceptually, it's rather ingenious, with well-aimed barbs at abusive commenter culture and social-media narcissism that adds up to a welcome moral for small fry...
21561	3	a	To say that Theron's is an astonishing performance is something of an understatement.
21562	6	a	After the movie makes its one didactic point, it repeats it endlessly, hoping to beat it into out heads that war is fruitless and senseless.
21563	9	a	Quaid and Stone look utterly ridiculous when they scream, a major debit in a movie of this type.
21564	9	a	Spade will be a former grownup star if he can't find funnier material than this.
21565	4	a	The action itself -- despite some bright, funny moments -- is often quite ordinary.
21566	7	a	This adaptation of M.L. Stedman's best-selling tearjerker is tasteful, elegant and decorous-but also stiff, overinflated and ponderous.
21567	3	a	a ragtag ensemble of purposely cartoony, yet lovable characters, host this silly, yet substantially entertaining little picture. 
21568	4	a	Shamelessly pun-filled, sexually explicit, socio-political animation - for an adult audience.
21569	3	a	Hilarious, fast, funny, fresh fun for the family.
21570	5	a	The Darkest Minds puts an X-Men spin on the typical 'teens in dystopia' YA formula, but the result is more derivative than creative. 
21571	7	a	A gross road film comedy that's as dim as a burnt out light bulb.
21572	4	a	It's a lot more tightly focused than the first outing.
21573	3	a	A disturbing, boldly conceived story.
21574	4	a	Manages to entertain and defy logic in equal measure.
21575	3	a	A little more time and a little more money might have turned Killer Joe into something truly great, or it might have ruined it, overwhelming the delicate chemistry with surface glitter. We'll never know.
21576	4	a	Too self-serious for its own good and attempts at giving it a lighter edge fall flat, but there is the suggestion at the end that this new, remodeled Bond is still only getting started.
21577	7	a	At best it's innocuous.
21578	4	a	While some of the film's ambiguity is welcome - we're never told why society has fallen apart, it's just a sadly acceptable given that it has - a good deal of it is disappointing.
21579	4	a	Though buoyed by excellent, unflinching performances, this melancholy drama reflects the dismally monotonous lives of its subjects just a little too well.
21580	3	a	This is a charming fantasy, that would still be entertaining after you've seen it a few times - once on the big screen and then later at home with some good Chinese take out.
21581	5	a	Martin Scorsese has his Goodfellas. David O. Russell answers with his Mediocre-fellas. 
21582	10	a	Virtually unwatchable and laugh-free.
21583	6	a	The filmmakers' references, their winks and nods to the audience, are far more diverting than the picture itself.
21584	3	a	It may not be Hotel Rwanda, but Don Cheadle does bring a nice dose of compassion to Hotel for Dogs.
21585	6	a	If you're a huge zombie fan, then by all means, go worship at the altar of Romero. But if you're just looking for a scary movie, you can do better on DVD
21586	6	a	Lazarus gets sloppy in a hurry.
21587	4	a	Sweaty and scrappy with sports stereotypes and showboating sentiment...
21588	4	a	Although Disney follows its standard formula in this animated adventure, it feels more forced than usual.
21589	1	a	Will look and feel all too familiar to victims of the jobless recovery, or at least those who can afford to see the movie.
21590	3	a	The action comedy, a biting satire of superhero mythology and the comedy that results from its real-world applications, makes you love the guy for his brutally logical demeanor.
21591	3	a	"The way this movie is made, the way this story is told, this is what is meant by the phrase ""keepin' it real."
21592	3	a	Furman keeps a tight rein on the film's palpable, sometimes suffocating tension. It's one of The Infiltrator's assets. Another is the ensemble cast.
21593	0	a	It's no wonder a generation of holidaymakers still thinks twice before stepping into the water.
21594	3	a	It's a lovely, often hilarious piece of work.
21595	3	a	The obsessive-compulsive disorder that propels the drama into a miasma of misplaced morality is as fascinating as it is designed to be with perhaps a repetition or two that takes some edge off the otherwise crisp showmanship.
21596	0	a	What is remarkable about It's a Wonderful Life is how well it holds up over the years; it's one of those ageless movies, like Casablanca or The Third Man, that improves with age.
21597	6	a	Annoyingly twee.
21598	4	a	A complacent uncomplicated family drama with simple yet endearing sensitivities.
21599	1	a	Pick a god, any god, and thank them for this movie. 
21600	2	a	Menashe humanizes Hasidic life In a pensive, emotional drama.
21601	5	a	"Even genre film lovers have standards, and ""John Carter"" doesn't meet them."
21602	3	a	The films in this vein that work are the ones who can make you care, even though you know the struggle is futile.
21603	4	a	Moves along predictable lines but does feature a glowing, Deneuveian performance from veteran screen star Fanny Ardant.
21604	1	a	You may not realize how strong the acting is until you replay the movie in your head later.
21605	8	a	I remember when the Wayanses were a group of people with ambitions who looked as if they actually had something to contribute to the film world as well as the comedy world.
21606	3	a	Amy Adams looks and sounds as if she indeed emerges from a fairy-tale land.
21607	4	a	This nostalgic roller skate down memory lane is shored up by a performance by Bow Wow that surprises in its depth and a soundtrack that keeps toes tapping.
21608	3	a	"First Adam Sandler's in an art film. Now Eminem's in a ""sports"" movie...go figure."
21609	4	a	Donnie Darko promises a feast, but when the film ends, you are left only with the scraps.
21610	4	a	There is no doubting that Logan Lucky has a big heart and tries its hardest to be endearing, but it falls a couple of rednecks short of a Lynyrd Skynyrd concert.
21611	4	a	Whimsical characters and an uplifting story put some bounce into this nostalgic family film.
21612	5	a	For a film about sprinting... Bhaag Milkha Bhaag moves at a snail's pace.
21613	6	a	Unless viewers are aficionados of the old royal family, I'm not sure how interested they'll be in following two posh-accented young women chasing through drunken crowds in period dress, though Powley, in particular, is a charmer.
21614	2	a	The Grey Zone gives voice to a story that needs to be heard in the sea of Holocaust movies...but the film suffers from its own difficulties.
21615	4	a	The problem is, the last section of the movie doesn't follow the career path of Greene: It traces the blander character of Hughes.
21616	3	a	A poignant and amusing black and white filmed road trip that brings an estranged father and son together.
21617	5	a	Pandorum director Alvart summons some scares here: Ferland is persuasively weird and hornets are utilised to skin-crawling effect. Most of his ideas are second-hand, though.
21618	3	a	Despite my reservations, The Ring works.
21619	1	a	All we can reasonably be sure of what they've been telling us since From Russia With Love: James Bond will return. He's welcome back any time.
21620	6	a	It might be well-crafted and well-acted, but it's still an unintentionally laughable film about an older man getting into an attractive younger girl's pants.
21621	3	a	"The Artist"" is a delightful and unique experience because it cares about things most movies no longer do."
21622	4	a	Called on to appear charismatic, contrite, slobby, sensitive, athletic and blitzed on cocaine in quick succession, Elba never drops the ball; likewise, Arterton conveys Emily's pride and pain persuasively.
21623	3	a	An energetic, violent movie with a momentum that never lets up.
21624	10	a	Absolutely atrocious, Silent Hill is probably the worst movie ever to be based on a video game.
21625	2	a	Although teetering on the brink of soppiness in places, and treading a well-worn path, the soft-in-the-middle script is lifted immeasurably by towering performances.
21626	5	a	An underdog story about over-dogs.
21627	4	a	Watchable, intelligent and provocative drama with a stunning central performance from Rachel Weisz...
21628	6	a	The movie ... finds itself in a strange place in tying Ted's legal fight to similar real-world ones.
21629	5	a	Can be fun if your expectations are low enough.
21630	5	a	More like a waddling turkey than a soaring bird.
21631	5	a	A teenage comedy with an old-fogy scent.
21632	1	a	With a spot-on accent and altogether charming performance, Hathaway makes another convincing statement that she has grown, as a woman and as an actress.
21633	5	a	All this is perfectly watchable, and there are some nice moments, but the film is fatally undermined by its tonal lurches from knockabout, fish-out-of-water comedy ...
21634	6	a	In the midst of comedy, seriousness. The combination feels forced. A more disciplined and smarter director might have been able to successfully blend the two elements, but crude dude MacFarlane hasn't the skill to bring it off.
21635	5	a	Just because a film takes place entirely in the long shadow of death doesn't mean it has to be this relentlessly dour.
21636	1	a	There are nifty tricks galore up the sumptuous sleeve of this offbeat and wildly entertaining thriller.
21637	3	a	Although not the grandiose epic it strives to be, Amistad is still a good film, with solid, but not superb, acting, and competent, but not transcendent, direction.
21638	3	a	The principal additions ... are more Amadeus, but not better.
21639	5	a	Like Middle Age Crazy and Ode to Billie Joe, Beer for My Horses belongs in that small but not exactly elite company of movies based on hit country songs.
21640	4	a	The film that re-invented the Sci-Fi wheel
21641	4	a	Sporadically engaging, Milos Forman's chronicle of American society and culture in the beginning of the twentieth century is too sprawling and dramatically diffuse, though some of the acting is excellent.
21642	4	a	Reign of Fire looks as if it was made without much thought -- and is best watched that way.
21643	4	a	Helmed by Eli Roth...this whimsical and magical feast is every bit as silly as it sounds. But listen, it all comes together rather splendidly.
21644	9	a	It's just terrible, with long stretches in which the sea of writers don't even try to insert any humour, followed by an attempted joke that doesn't work on any level.
21645	1	a	It is a brilliant, moving and charming film that delves into self-discovery and is perfect for this century. [Full Review in Spanish] 
21646	10	a	Poo is too kind a word to describe the flat, gray nature of Disney's reenvisioned Hundred Acre Wood and the trademarked bland anonymity director Marc Forster brings to the party.
21647	0	a	This is the Muppets' finest film. Its mashup of slapstick, songs and literary adaptation is suitably anarchic, but crucially it gets Dickens right.
21648	4	a	'The Wedding Date' doesn't exactly resurrect romantic comedy, but it proves there's still life in the genre.
21649	1	a	A very lovable and witty comedy that should be a welcome friend in this sequel-heavy summer.
21650	10	a	Given that this is a prequel...there's no suspense, only ninety minutes of lip-smacking sadism. This is entertainment?
21651	4	a	Given a subject that has become synonymous with overblown mythmaking, its modesty becomes it.
21652	0	a	Director and co-writer David O. Russell deserves all the credit in the world for creating a story, characters and environment in which his actors could truly get lost.
21653	1	a	Chicken Run Movie Review 
21654	5	a	Valkyrie transforms World War II into a boy's adventure.
21655	0	a	Tim Burton's imagination jumped into the saddle and held onto the bridle with Beetlejuice.
21656	1	a	One of the most fun, stylish movies in recent memory.
21657	4	a	The film may play best to insiders, but the talent behind it is obvious to all.
21658	1	a	A suspense thriller with a tense, jazzy score and a rich undercurrent of fatalistic irony.
21659	6	a	The sort of multiplex-buster that depends more on editing and production design than on story line.
21660	3	a	The Passion of the Christ is powerfully moving and fanatically obtuse in equal doses.
21661	1	a	The title may mean nothing to you, but the movie certainly will.
21662	4	a	I liked it, and if you're a sci-fi/fantasy fan, you'll probably like it even more.
21663	6	a	As a book, I'm sure COSMOPOLIS was fascinating. As a film, anchored by a dull lead, it borders on excrutiating.
21664	5	a	"Zoo"" leaves you wondering whether Crowe was spooked by the mixed reaction to ""Vanilla Sky"" and ""Elizabethtown"" and chose to play it safe, remixing echoes of his usual screenwriting devices, in pursuit of a surefire hit."
21665	3	a	A hilarious hodgepodge of The In-Laws and Annie Hall, in which De Niro gives his best comic performance to date.
21666	4	a	Much of the reason for the film's success is down to the pairing of Grant and Bullock, and it's easy to see how the film could have been a leaden disaster in the hands of blander actors.
21667	2	a	Poetic filmmaking drawing on--and continuing--a long tradition of religious art.
21668	8	a	As tedious as it is antithetical.
21669	3	a	The movie's subject is the intricate web of paranoia and competitive aggression that creeps down and smothers any flicker of loyalty.
21670	0	a	A spiritual adventure story about a Sufi grocer who passes on the wisdom of this path of wonder, love and beauty to a lonely adolescent boy who yearns for something more.
21671	3	a	The kids are superb - the ups and downs of the Joe/Patrick friendship ring true, while oddball Moises Arias steals scenes left, right and off-centre.
21672	10	a	With a reasonable smattering of gore, and some absolutely breathtaking set and costume design, del Toro's final product is a truly unique beast.
21673	0	a	Your best bet for a movie that will entertain you, make you laugh and maybe even make you tear-up.
21674	4	a	No disgrace, but it's far from a classic either.
21675	3	a	Always a meticulous, quirky, and sometimes revelatory actor, Philip Seymour Hoffman in his directorial debut nurtures his splendid cast into similar performances.
21676	2	a	An engaging feature, smartly cast, while showing a little more sophistication than the genre typically receives. It's too bad Norris couldn't make a few more of these before the Cannon Films curse claimed his marquee value for good. 
21677	5	a	"There really is no good reason for Don Cheadle to be in Hotel for Dogs, unless perhaps he's somehow contractually obliged to appear in every movie that features the word ""hotel"" in its title."
21678	3	a	I laughed even though Lawrence has been doing the paranoid brother shtick since his sketchy, self-titled-sitcom days.
21679	5	a	In the end, it's too polite and considered a portrait of a rude and chaotic world, but as with most Philip Roth adaptions, there's plenty to talk about afterward.
21680	5	a	The astonishingly inept finish could serve as a primer in screenwriting classes on how not to wind up a family drama.
21681	4	a	Despite Auteuil's performance, it's a rather listless amble down the middle of the road, where the thematic ironies are too obvious and the sexual politics too smug.
21682	3	a	Gore Verbinski creates an air of dread that begins with the first scene and never lets up, subtly incorporating elements from the current wave of Japanese horror films along the way.
21683	3	a	A raw movie, but it relies on the natural appeal of its main character and the skill with which Loach creates a thoroughly believable environment.
21684	2	a	It's fun for the kids, and adults should have a good time too.
21685	3	a	The film borders on awe-inspiring, borders on wondrous, but unfortunately, Cameron's attempts to cop Spielberg's sense of magic made the film fall sadly short.
21686	6	a	A film for people who like really loud car sounds, who get breathless when tires squeal and clutches pop, who dream of a special button near the steering wheel that takes your lemon- yellow Skyline from super fast to super super fast.
21687	0	a	Urbane, alert, funny, compassionate.
21688	3	a	[It seems to deny] that love can be both spirited and faithful, enraptured and disciplined. [But], the visual splendor outweighs the narrative's missteps.
21689	6	a	Vogt-Roberts makes the scenery look great, but doesn't call the plays that could make the movie score. Scenes don't develop, characters don't evolve except in indie-movie-cute ways.
21690	4	a	Not a good movie, but a creepy performance by Culkin rescues it.
21691	4	a	The whole thing is as fake and fragile as a cheap commemorative mug, but there's ripe fun to be had in its tickety-boo trashiness.
21692	3	a	Hereafter makes no grand statement about life after death. It's just Eastwood pondering the subject, as any thoughtful person might, and inviting us to think along with him. It's hard to pass up so sincere an offer.
21693	5	a	If you've never seen such a 'second chance at life' film, this one may work for you to some degree, especially if you're a connoisseur of/sucker for forced, contrived and predictable material and moments posing as heartfelt and moving ones.
21694	3	a	You walk out of it thinking, that's totally plausible and, while sick, a great idea.
21695	3	a	If you're looking for nonstop, no-holds-barred exploitation, look no further. Pam Grier's first solo starring role is an enormously entertaining black action classic.
21696	3	a	Edgar Wright's finale to the Cornetto Trilogy's The World's End is finally upon us and it's a suitably poetic and conclusive last call for Simon Pegg and Nick Frost's 'man-child' dynamic duo.
21697	4	a	An adventure that feels real and fantastical at the same time.
21698	0	a	Terrific entertainment -- not an academic exercise but an unabashed crowd-pleaser.
21699	4	a	There's not much to it, but Austin Chick's hyper-focused indie does serve as a nicely assured showcase for lead Josh Hartnett.
21700	2	a	Hitch will make a great date movie.
21701	2	a	An entertaining, accomplished movie that shows off what its signature technology can do...
21702	0	a	Thirteen Days is a good movie about a profound moment in world history.
21703	4	a	Thanks to an ensemble cast that includes Robert De Niro, Barbra Streisand and Dustin Hoffman, Meet The Fockers is much more fun than anticipated.
21704	2	a	...a film that demands to be seen, despite its flaws. It's part of American history and a story that we should all know.
21705	3	a	"The idea of actors being mistaken for their roles was used in ""The Three Amigos,"" but ""Galaxy Quest"" mines the comic potential better."
21706	9	a	Cute? If you say so. Funny? If I had a nickel for every time I laughed, I'd have a dime.
21707	3	a	A surprisingly funny comedy. Fans of the original Star Trek will be the ones who enjoy most of the film's in-jokes. But, there's something humorous in here for everyone.
21708	2	a	Big, stupid fun.
21709	0	a	The Coen brothers' screenplay is faithful to McCarthy without being obsequious. In filming it, they play it straight, and the touches of signature humor that are there don't seem like flashes of style, but organic and right.
21710	2	a	Love, Simon is an adorable addition to the teen movie canon.
21711	2	a	Not unlike an older woman's wet dream.
21712	0	a	Tarkovsky's keen sense of spatial dynamics make Andrei Rublev a film of unerring beauty, one that would be remembered as some kind of masterwork on the strength of its photography alone.
21713	4	a	This is a solid piece of good old-fashioned escapism.
21714	0	a	[Penn has] clearly found his home, his calling and consequently the best movie of his career in Jon Krakauer's best-selling nonfiction book Into the Wild.
21715	3	a	While catching a Pauly Shore movie might rank somewhere slightly below self-tracheotomy on the To-Do lists of most people, I'm about to tell you something quietly shocking -- this is actually one of the funnier movies I've seen in a while.
21716	3	a	It's brisk and assured and never begs the audience's indulgence. No time is wasted. The movie is, at every moment, either funny or pushing the story forward, or both.
21717	4	a	Depp achieves one of his mightiest feats, rescuing the overly theatrical Libertine from itself.
21718	3	a	The baby Heffalump, Lumpy, is funny and adorable and carries the film.
21719	3	a	I'm not entirely convinced that Fincher has a firm grasp yet on the tender and the sweet, but it's heartening to see him try -- let alone succeed as well as he does.
21720	0	a	Gripping, twisting and worth seeing again.
21721	2	a	The Ring is a surprisingly effective creeper.
21722	4	a	So-so entertainment.
21723	1	a	An honest, humorous, bittersweet, disturbing look at the confusion of adolescence.
21724	0	a	"Dark, demented and oddly tender at its admittedly bleak center, ""The Skin I Live In"" is one of those films that viewers will either love or loathe in equal measure--I cannot imagine anyone coming away from something like with a ""meh"" reaction."
21725	6	a	The action sequences, it must be said, are intense, and the film is fun, if you can swallow all the hokum.
21726	1	a	It seems the reason we haven't yet had a major King biopic is because cinema was waiting for a director to make a film as worthy as the man himself - Ava DuVernay has stepped up to the daunting task and she has succeeded effortlessly.
21727	1	a	Bejo and Dujardin give their characters indelible countenances and overall vibrancy. She's bright; he's elegant and funny. Whatever the film lacks in terms of achieving deep impact, they sparkle together.
21728	1	a	A delightful adventure for families.
21729	7	a	A shaggy-dog tale that, despite a talented cast, is a cinematic mutt.
21730	4	a	Beautiful and well-acted, expertly staged and shot, but tonally very uneven, veering wildly from one style of film to another with little warning.
21731	9	a	Too lazy to take advantage of its semi-humorous premise.
21732	9	a	Lost Horizon strangely remade as a modern Western, but at least it's not a musical.
21733	1	a	A hilarious, tension-filled romp that should please any audience.
21734	2	a	The combination of believable ball play, solid performances and hard-nosed inspiration make for worthwhile entertainment during this post-holiday season.
21735	6	a	Devotes as much time to a creaky love triangle as it does exploring the fantastic powers of its foursome. And that begs the question: Who goes to a movie like this looking for what is essentially a bad episode of Dawson's Creek?
21736	5	a	Presents itself as the first SAT protest film... but predictably becomes a toothless pep rally for business as usual...
21737	5	a	But what bugs me most is how underused Olivia Munn is.
21738	6	a	A sporadically diverting thriller that has the personality of a Diet Coke ad.
21739	7	a	A little less than half of the film worked for me, which cannot justify a recommendation.
21740	6	a	Had the cast and promise to be so much better than what finally ended up on screen.
21741	3	a	A powerful, artistic expression of one of the most pivotal moments in the Christian religion.
21742	6	a	When a movie's title is based on a crass pun, you shouldn't expect the bar to be too high
21743	9	a	There is not one joke in Meet the Fockers.
21744	5	a	Solid performances, but the screenplay is a clunky, contrived and stilted mess.
21745	6	a	Light It Up smolders and spits out some smoke, but no fire.
21746	5	a	It doesn't work as a science fiction epic, it doesn't work as a tale of families bonding in the face of tragedy, and it certainly doesn't work as a mingling of the two.
21747	2	a	Likeable and astute, Friends with Kids is a minor revelation in a genre currently starved for worthwhile entries.
21748	6	a	It's when the action slows down that you can feel the brain cells dying.
21749	0	a	"[VIDEO ESSAY] ""Slacker"" is a hallmark of American independent cinema because it is so thoroughly original in its concepts and execution."
21750	3	a	A dark morality tale about fear, about acceptance, and about non-conformity.
21751	3	a	...enfolds young viewers like a favorite blanket.
21752	5	a	Somewhere along the line, its copious shortcomings end up overwhelming its better elements.
21753	2	a	Flightplan is a good example of Foster's uncanny ability to make almost any material work.
21754	1	a	Woman On The Beach is a stripped-down, witty explication of how we all get stymied by the impulses and options inherent in the simple act of living.
21755	4	a	For the most part this is a perky delight that takes a cheeky glee in biting the gloved hand that feeds.
21756	5	a	This film struggles to translate Fountain's novel into something with its own strong point of view.
21757	1	a	While the ultimate takeaway from Silver Linings Playbook is, as the title suggests, optimistic, it's not just because the film has two recognizable stars and a cutesy premise.
21758	4	a	The weakest one in the series.
21759	1	a	This movie does not aspire to greatness or significance; being extremely clever and thoroughly competent is the goal here.
21760	5	a	Average comedy that squanders its decent premise in favour of a splattering of unfunny gross-out gags.
21761	1	a	Karamakate worries the world will forget how to see and hear. This lucid, original and unsettling cinematic dream offers a way to remember.
21762	4	a	An entertaining biopicture about the rise of Chess Records and its impressive list of blues musicians and singers.
21763	4	a	The movie doesn't narrate what happened so much as immerse itself in Alex's numb state of alienation and denial, which I didn't find quite as rewarding as I guess I was supposed to.
21764	0	a	One may interpret the final moments of First Reformed as the despondency of Good Friday or the hope of Easter; in either case, it is holy ground.
21765	3	a	Mr. King's direction, occasionally, is inspired, and the photography has unusual style and dramatic impact.
21766	1	a	This trio of powerhouse performances make The Light Between Oceans a romantic weepie that earns its tears.
21767	3	a	Yet another of the all reason-defying examples of sequels that are as good as if not better than their earlier films.
21768	4	a	The narrative often feels more like a raunchy sex comedy than a bird's-eye view of the on-the-job hazards that Barker routinely faced.
21769	10	a	It is an obnoxious, sexist, crude, disgusting, and dead-in-the-water series of lame actions and insipid character situations.
21770	7	a	When Sissy Spacek speaks her cliched lines in the mediocre screenplay of Lake City, her delivery lends them a resonance that is not in the written words.
21771	8	a	Neither scary, perversely funny nor suspenseful, this demented dung heap is not even inventively gory.
21772	6	a	Has some choice words to say about following one's heart in matters of art.
21773	5	a	Del Toro has all the right dramatic ingredients and pure technical mastery, but the story is lacking serious threat, often caught admiring itself instead of marching forward as a proper spine-tingler. 
21774	5	a	Sterile but still entertaining, this is far from a disaster, but definitely a disappointment.
21775	4	a	Paper Heart isn't the most cloying instance of earnest indie quirk to emerge in the past few months, nor is it the most charming, but the mere fact that such a continuum exists is reason enough to worry.
21776	2	a	Slices into the darkness of every scene with a razor's edge of finely calibrated suspense, tension, grief, paranoia and primal fear.
21777	3	a	In spite of a near-desperate need to entertain viewers no matter what corner or crevice they peer into, Disney's savvy enough to apply the Pixar formula to ensure tugging a heart-string or two.
21778	1	a	What if John Wyndham decided to write a comedy?
21779	4	a	Scruffy Canadian comedy whose laughs land more often than they miss. 
21780	9	a	Offensive, vile, and, even worse, not funny.
21781	2	a	IF you missed the girls-gone-bad comedy of Rough Night earlier this year, don't worry. Go and see Girls Trip instead.
21782	1	a	This movie is all about the dingy glamour of self-pitying rage.
21783	3	a	The Light... veers dangerously close to melodrama, but it manages to steer clear thanks to the restrained performances of its cast.
21784	3	a	Sends you home with your head in the clouds, intoxicated by the magic movies pull off better than any other art form.
21785	9	a	This is sermonising, not drama, and I suspect I won't be alone in finding it obnoxiously misogynistic.
21786	6	a	...a somewhat anticlimactic capper to a seriously subpar series of films. 
21787	3	a	When the Disney people go after your holiday dollar, they don't leave anything in the paint box.
21788	5	a	The cast's enthusiasm goes a long way toward keeping the whole mediocre affair from becoming completely intolerable.
21789	3	a	Herzfeld's characters border on the bizarre, and yet each is endearing.
21790	3	a	A fine, relatively non-violent example of pure family entertainment.
21791	3	a	Like all his film's, this one has a homebrew flavour of Soderbergh's backyard of anti-studio film development. That makes it both fresh and fantastic.
21792	5	a	The music is quite good and will certainly appeal to Prince fans, but it is buried under so much tedious pretention that even the performer's most devoted fans will find it difficult to sit through the film.
21793	3	a	Sofia Coppola's accomplished sophomore work is a personal, melancholy film, based on her own experience, and benefiting from strong chemistry between Bill Murray and Scarlett Johansson.
21794	5	a	After years of animators riding the post-Pixar renaissance and filmgoers feasting on the fruits of their labor, we may have finally hit a collective moment of big-screen-toon fatigue.
21795	5	a	Heavy on the celebrity cameos but fresh out of clever ideas.
21796	5	a	The movie is saved from the trash-bin thanks to Clint Eastwood.
21797	4	a	In many ways it is a very clever film, but it never lives up to the promise of its visual brilliance.
21798	5	a	Like a documentary version of Fight Club, shorn of social insight, intellectual pretension and cinematic interest.
21799	6	a	How exactly does one lose a dog as red as a plum tomato and as big as an airplane hangar? This big-screen version of the animated PBS series offers a pallid, yet reasonably painless, reply.
21800	1	a	Mystic River returns Eastwood to the general excellence of the Oscar-winning Unforgiven while retaining the square-jawed plainspokenness that is his trademark.
21801	6	a	You know Melissa McCarthy has arrived in Hollywood when you see her receive mediocre material like Identity Thief and watch her make it funnier than it deserves to be.
21802	10	a	Pretty much a mess...truly a terrible movie.
21803	3	a	A well-crafted message picture disguised as soap opera.
21804	6	a	This is film as comfort food, and even if it has very little nutritional value, its pleasantly bland texture will help keep you occupied until your next job interview or layoff notice.
21805	5	a	O'Donnell's lazy, inexpressive performance here should prove to the suits once and for all that this walking, talking rice cake incarnate does not have what it takes to become a major star.
21806	4	a	Overall, the movie skims the surface of a potentially sharp satire or a compelling self-discovery journey with an underserved Tina Fey. It's not enough.
21807	9	a	Ultimately, you've seen it before, and there's no reason to see it again. Let's hope the real Jackie Kallen's life is more inspiring than this.
21808	5	a	The first one was so-so. This one is less so.
21809	9	a	Story can't infuse this juvenile hunk of entertainment with either the wit or the savvy to make it seem like anything more than an overblown version of Saturday- morning TV.
21810	3	a	It may be unnecessarily raunchy at times, but there are plenty of strong moments and the heavy-handed political commentary is potent if obvious.
21811	4	a	Breakin' transcends cliches thanks to Jamie Foxx's irreverence and charm
21812	9	a	A mind- numbingly awful motion picture that has a better chance of making a viewer physically ill than of provoking a genuine laugh.
21813	4	a	Samuel L. Jackson is on record as saying this movie isn't for critics. He's right about that. The problem is, it's not for many other people, either. Unless they're stoned. Or drunk. Or just enjoy making fun of bad movies.
21814	8	a	Not only incessantly talky, but talky in that arch, affected fashion that not only sets one's teeth on edge but induces deep drowsiness as well.
21815	2	a	There's a blinding nasty truth about the young filmmaker's own generation that he richly exploits...
21816	2	a	Flawless period re-creation.
21817	1	a	The greatest achievement of author Golden and director Marshall is their delicate capturing of the viciousness of women among women.
21818	3	a	"Kelly Fremon Craig is a good writer, who is also a good director, and ""The Edge of Seventeen"" is the beginning of a career worth watching."
21819	3	a	The [film succeeds] at conveying some of the enormity of the Holocaust, as well as some of its banal details, in a fully accessible manner, at a time when much of our collective memory and understanding of it is rapidly slipping away.
21820	6	a	There is beauty in Kagemusha but it is impersonal, distant and ghostly. The old master has never been more rigorous.
21821	0	a	Todd Haynes' commitment to outcasts, then and now, makes Carol a romantic spellbinder that cuts deep. It's one of the year's very best films. Blanchett and Mara should have Oscar calling. 
21822	6	a	Ryan's Daughter takes far too long to say much too little.
21823	3	a	Nicholson's personality comes through in the film's rhythms: crazed and vibrant at times, classical and refined at other times.
21824	5	a	An R-rated Doris Day film set in a shopping mall. Amazing enough, but who will pay to see it?
21825	6	a	A lighter-than-air trifle...
21826	5	a	Defiantly optimistic, but phony. 
21827	6	a	Paper Towns is an exercise in artifice.
21828	6	a	Canned emotions.
21829	9	a	It's hard to buy this minor melding of Rocky and Erin Brockovich as anything but a punched-up star vehicle for an actress in a slump.
21830	2	a	Despite a second-act sag, the visuals make The Adventures of Baron Munchausen a worthwhile film.
21831	6	a	So verbally flatfooted and so emotionally predictable or bland that it plays like the standard made-for-TV movie.
21832	5	a	Sorry, Lance, but Rudy Ray Moore you ain't.
21833	6	a	Cute protagonists, sensible morals and refreshing lack of complexity make Aliens in the Attic a bit of guilty pleasure.
21834	3	a	Highly recommended for fans of Lancaster or Jean Simmons, who plays the earnest young preacher who gets caught up in Gantry's web.
21835	4	a	Directed with the wan functionality that has become Allen's trademark, the movie is a somewhat stale bonbon with a delicious time-travel center.
21836	0	a	Alexander Payne's excellent drama offers its own brand of quirky joys, including a transparently earnest performance by Chicago native Bruce Dern.
21837	0	a	Capping a summer movie season when humanity was practically extinct every other weekend, Wright gives Armageddon a funnier name than even This Is the End did.
21838	4	a	Greatly enhanced by the spirited Oscar performance by Burt Lancaster.
21839	9	a	A string of gross one-liners about ho's, white-man university, ho's, marijuana, ho's, the sexual inadequacy of Orientals, ho's, amazingly clueless white people, and ho's.
21840	1	a	Whatever small flaws might exist in My Sassy Girl, the charismatic leads make it more than worthwhile.
21841	3	a	Offbeat dramedy mixes light and dark; some intense moments.
21842	2	a	Only has one thing going for it and that's Will Smith, but that's enough.
21843	1	a	With the power of Spielberg and Cruise behind it, the sinister and tense War of the Worlds is this summer's blockbuster to beat them all.
21844	4	a	For summer fare, it wasn't half bad.
21845	9	a	An inept assembly of ill-matched plot points.
21846	8	a	If only if were possible to go back in time and retrieve the two hours we wasted watching this idiotic adaptation of Michael Crichton's time-travel novel.
21847	7	a	The film has a bigger budget than the previous outings - glitzy European locations, star cameos and so on - but none of the charm.
21848	1	a	Happily and ridiculously over the top, Secret Things is a war of anarchic, sexual primitisim.
21849	8	a	A soft, approachable film, about simple, peaceful emotions and characters. That may sound unambitious, but it is the most ambitious thing of all.
21850	3	a	Atkinson is able to hit the comic jackpot through grunts, gestures, body movements, and, most of all, facial expressions.
21851	4	a	A masterfully crafted entertainment that devolves into an overlong, overly loud, and disappointingly stock shoot 'em up.
21852	4	a	More an exhibition of precious acting than an absorbing narrative.
21853	5	a	Thuddingly unfunny.
21854	5	a	Leaving the actors aside, however, the real problem with the film is the way it is shot. 
21855	4	a	A fine showcase for Theron's powerhouse performance, but in comparison to the great true-crime pictures of the past, it comes up short.
21856	0	a	It creates a story with characters that might not be all good or all bad, much in the way real life exists, but we care about them all.
21857	5	a	[I]t's not too much to expect that, if a movie is going to ask the big questions, it at least follow through in exploring them with some degree of curiosity.
21858	4	a	Quibbles aside, there's a lot to enjoy in the film; it's very efficiently made, and though never totally inspiring, it's eminently watchable.
21859	5	a	Unfortunately falls into Altman's pile of disappointments.
21860	4	a	As a salon full of characters, Impromptu provides great fly on the wall fun.
21861	4	a	The repeated iterations of fight, flight and respite here get wearing. Especially perhaps because, with Jackson's fetish for detail, they take more time to watch on screen than to read about.
21862	6	a	Probably won't convince many people that the girl next door is anything more than that.
21863	2	a	For existing fans of the Final Destination franchise, this movie is an absolute must see.
21864	3	a	"Piles on enough eye candy and action sequences to please fans, plus more humor than the three ""Rings"" films - even if it only occasionally achieves the trio's grandeur."
21865	2	a	In spite of the screenplay's one-note didacticism, the movie's nightmarish atmosphere is intense enough to box you into a scary corner.
21866	1	a	Brady, rarely raising his voice above a murmur, takes us on an emotional journey, figuring out his own way forward. The plains go on forever; so, we hope, does hope.
21867	5	a	A huge disappointment, crude and simple compared to Aardman's earlier, more sophisticated and multilayered work. No satire or subversion, just a bog-standard triumph-of-the-underdog story.
21868	3	a	If loving S.O.A.P. is wrong, I don't want to be right.
21869	9	a	A trifle of a musical revue.
21870	3	a	Devastating.
21871	3	a	Stunningly subversive, even for Wilder.
21872	2	a	A deftly executed examination of the man at the centre of the scandal and the psychological scars that come from being a Kennedy scion. In this, Clarke does a wonderful job at conveying the conflict brewing inside Ted.
21873	1	a	Providing a voice to a group of people seldom seen on the big screen, Embrace of the Serpent is a must-see.
21874	6	a	The film gets crazy and seems unconnected. It has some funny moments but mostly left me cold. Go see it and judge for yourself.
21875	2	a	The plot is somewhat complicated, and only a little bit predictable. However, like any good magic trick, even if you know the outcome, it's fun to watch the process.
21876	2	a	Will Smith is darker, sexier in his latest summer blockbuster... but despite an entertaining execution of Isaac Asimov's robotic visions, it leaves you cold.
21877	6	a	Morgan and Wong's snarky iterations on their initial premise don't show much development...a fair diversion but, make no mistake, a waste of time.
21878	6	a	"There's just not enough on the screen to buy into ""Rock Dog."" It doesn't gel, and lacks the kind of visual kinetics and energy we've come to expect from films of this ilk. "
21879	3	a	A very good sequel even though the result of the climactic Balboa vs. Creed rematch is pretty much a foregone conclusion. This is where the series should have ended.
21880	9	a	The seesaw of effect of oscillating between extolling Sidney's genius and lingering on his anguish begins to feel like a child slowly burning an ant with a magnifying glass, occasionally taking breaks to truly savor the harm he or she is committing.
21881	9	a	A dreadful, time-traveling, almost incomprehensible [film].
21882	2	a	"I can forgive a lot if you make me leave the theater thinking ""THAT... WAS... AWESOME."
21883	4	a	It Comes at Night is the feel-bad movie of the year. I can't help but feel as if audiences are going to hate it. And I can't blame them if they do.
21884	3	a	"Steven Soderbergh returns to the big screen after a self-imposed ""retirement"" with a movie that's very much in the vein of his Ocean's trilogy but pulpier and quirkier -- and tons of fun. "
21885	2	a	The essential commitment to freedom is so much a part of the story that, at least in this one brief moment, justice triumphed.
21886	2	a	Fortunately, Moore manages to find many such interesting cinematic diversions to spice things up.
21887	10	a	Eyeball-gougingly awful.
21888	3	a	A solid double rather than a grand slam, The Sandlot remains a refreshing antidote to the daily round of contract squabbles on the sports page.
21889	3	a	The Break-Up is ultimately a big budget heart-heavy indy film, and not a slapstick broad comedy as the ads would have you think...
21890	3	a	Early Clint behind the camera shows the promise to come.
21891	5	a	It seems that it's time to admit that dressing actors in LED-studded catsuits, asking them to give performances on sterile white sets and handing the results to a team of computer animators is not a way to make a good movie.
21892	2	a	There is plenty to enjoy here, including some impressive sets, especially those used for a harrowing plane crash at sea and the interior of a Dutch windmill.
21893	4	a	"Movies are a secular church, but Forest Whitaker makes ""Black Nativity"" feel like an actual one."
21894	0	a	A surprisingly talented Will Forte plays the son of a cantankerous old drunk, the fascinating Bruce Dern, as he takes a road trip to claim a million-dollar sweepstakes prize that no one thinks he's won. This is Alexander Payne at the top of his game.
21895	8	a	I can certainly empathize with the characters in this film because for two hours I too was in Medieval Hell. 
21896	1	a	Berg, a veteran of both CBS News and CNN, carefully and calmly assembles a devastating case against church officials' mendacity.
21897	4	a	...a serviceable and nostalgic coming-of-age kiddie comedy that resonates...has enough heart and soul to capture the giddy delight of its festive confines.
21898	3	a	Blanchett captures the lioness quality of Carol, steaming forward with blinders on as she finds herself entranced by Therese's innocence. Her slow, sultry hand moving across her lover's shoulder is a vibrant action that speaks impeccable volumes.
21899	1	a	With No Country for Old Men the Coens may have made their ultimate statement. You may not agree with their pessimism, but they so effectively tell their story that you cannot help but be swept up in their vision.
21900	3	a	Basically you have The Fugitive with CIA agents moving through an entire plot that could be written on a napkin, but it moves like a thunderbolt riding a cheetah.
21901	6	a	It's a depressing reality to face, but the second of J.K. Rowling's boy-wizard books was the least interesting read... and hasn't fared much better on film.
21902	3	a	It takes a few magical moments to savor the wonder and magic of the title house before all heck breaks loose.
21903	1	a	...this one has heart.
21904	4	a	Kim's soul-searching is at the heart of it all, and when the movie is focused on her relatable dilemmas it's better than when it's not. 
21905	5	a	Comedy version of, 'Indecent Proposal.' Oddly enough, both of them are equally stupid.
21906	3	a	It's filled with characters who, desperate to feel deep, want answers to life's big questions. And watching it, you, also desperate to feel deep, will want answers to big questions like, 'What's this all about?'
21907	3	a	The Bourne Supremacy shows how a spy film should really be done.
21908	0	a	Lyrical and deeply touching...as intimate, humane, and heartfelt as any love story this year.
21909	6	a	In Amistad, an admirable but disappointing effort...[Speilberg] veers between stoic political correctness and mushy Hollywood platitudes.
21910	4	a	It's refreshing to see characters who are practical and believable, making for an entertaining watch -- but it's definitely not one for the faint-hearted.
21911	3	a	All the hijinks and misunderstandings are rooted in the woes and/or promise of the family's past, present, and future, making the film an especially thoughtful bittersweet comedy.
21912	3	a	To Live Her Life is, to this very early point in his career, Godard's crowning achievement.
21913	6	a	"Called ""revisionist"" upon release in a bizarre misuse of the term, Silverado is neither something new nor something paying homage but rather a hollow facsimile"
21914	3	a	A winning, whacky, hugely enjoyable slice of Australiana that begins with a whisper and ends with a heck of a bang...unspools as a big, boisterous period comedy driven by a thirst for revenge, a desire for romance and a hunger to entertain. 
21915	4	a	If only director Vondie Curtis Hall were content with making a lean, mean action thriller, as he and his film soon find themselves waist deep and in over their head in pretentious ambition.
21916	4	a	A funny sex comedy about not having sex.
21917	6	a	Hoffman and Streisand are the best things about Meet the Fockers. The movie would have been better off spending more time with them instead of focusing again on the uneasy relationship between eager-to-please Greg and his father-in-law- to-be Jack.
21918	2	a	Has plenty of funny, even tender moments until it veers in a different, messy direction an hour in.
21919	3	a	At its best, it's a valentine of venom, sent with mirth and malice aforethought.
21920	8	a	...enjoyable but slightly underwhelming...
21921	3	a	Anyone who has had -- or has imagined -- a doomed youthful fling might be susceptible to this charming, bittersweet film.
21922	1	a	It's one of those rare films that makes you think and gives you a debate to have with your loved ones. A deep, human movie that doesn't shy away from baring its soul and the vast complexities that come with it. 
21923	5	a	I was convinced I was going to hate this film. But, it didn't bug me as much as I thought it would.
21924	1	a	Certainly not for everyone, but if you're looking for something different, something outrageously fascinating, something daring and open-ended, this is it.
21925	3	a	The exploration of the internet falls short of the joys that made the first film so compelling. At the same time, it will be a fun romp that should bring joy to the family.
21926	8	a	I left Fresh with my mouth literally hanging open, affected to the bone by a spectacular piece of storytelling.
21927	6	a	No doubt this yarn enthralled Larry and Meg Kasdan's dinner guests, but onscreen the crisis seems dull and inconsequential, in part because the quest for the dog is essentially a MacGuffin that drives the blah 'real' story about marital reconciliation. 
21928	6	a	Hudson needs a little more time to hone her comedic skills before she can charm us through all the watery spots in the film's hot-laughs and cold-jokes script.
21929	2	a	An interesting if not entirely satisfactory theatrical interpretation of magical rivalries.
21930	4	a	It has the creativity, but the jokes don't have enough brain power to compensate for the generic plot.
21931	4	a	At its best, The Good Girl is a refreshingly adult take on adultery...
21932	3	a	Gladiator isn't groundbreaking, but it's good old-fashioned entertainment.
21933	4	a	I can't imagine how Smith can capture a big enough audience to pay off this private joke, but the inner geek in me had too much fun to care.
21934	9	a	Barely two minutes go by in this picture without some kind of glaring nonsense in the script or the action.
21935	3	a	Christopher Nolan brings a shadowy, gas-lit aura to The Prestige, and gets strongly diverse performances from Jackman and Bale.
21936	5	a	Tyler Perry-style family comedy has a shortage of laughs, a plethora of sitcom stupidity.
21937	6	a	This often amusing but also aimless and forgettable animated comedy is noteworthy mostly for its random musical numbers and surprising amounts of violence.
21938	5	a	Prides itself on a clever twist and a few great red herrings. You know how I know? Because it actually tells us. Literally. As in, in the dialogue.
21939	5	a	Flightplan has holes and blank spots you could steer an airbus through.
21940	3	a	Moore gives a controlled portrait of emotional implosion ...
21941	4	a	Schindler's List is bearable when the characters keep the tension, but the film lapses when its epic drama and sentimentality take over. [Full Review in Spanish]
21942	4	a	This is a con movie where the con utterly fails... but everything else succeeds.
21943	3	a	This is a dark and upsetting horror, with zero gimmicks but plenty of unease to leave you thinking about its final scenes for a long while.
21944	2	a	It's the rare movie that knows its limitations, but also understands how to use form to best convey its strengths ...
21945	4	a	"Talented cast can't save formulaic ""Bad Moms""-lite comedy. "
21946	2	a	If it's guilty of too much understatement, of being too muted, you can just chalk that up to the timid nature of its title character infusing every scene with the sadness of somebody voluntarily burying himself alive.
21947	1	a	Benedict Cumberbatch is brilliant.
21948	5	a	Dumb humor, insults and gallons of bodily fluids.
21949	3	a	Lancaster's brilliant performance anchors Frankenheimer's fine film, a liberal-minded, optimistic celebration of the power of redemption.
21950	2	a	You'd be hard-pressed to find another movie that conveys the contrasts of life in the modern world more effectively.
21951	4	a	Far from perfect but almost obnoxiously entertaining.
21952	5	a	...the derivative dramatics of hormonal awkwardness, cynical imprisonment and the overall struggles of growing pains--her junior-sized X-Men copycat is a rote, manipulative melodrama pandering to the lazy sentiments of its younger demographics.
21953	3	a	Still Alice becomes more and more engrossing as it progresses...
21954	3	a	Mendes has embraced the general super-ness of Bond and taken his inspiration from the best superhero flick of recent years: The Dark Knight.
21955	3	a	"I am so accustomed to inventing ""angles"" for my reviews that a movie like this threatens to flummox me. It defies all angles and conventional approaches."
21956	3	a	An edifying glimpse at a moment in black history when the world really was looking on.
21957	2	a	This film's slightly uneven structure is easily overcome by the exceptional cast.
21958	5	a	[Cube abandons] the heavy-on-dialogue rhythm in favor of needless subplots rife with hijinks.
21959	3	a	This is a grand and grown-up film that shows Payne back at the top of his form.
21960	5	a	With its sermonising about the importance of being strong in the face of marital adversity - not to mention a sappy voiceover on the nature of suffering - the film feels more like a lecture than a drama.
21961	3	a	The first film to deal with the Holocaust on such an affecting and personal level, this is a powerful and painfully tragic film.
21962	5	a	If the film were any less significant, it would simply evaporate from existence.
21963	2	a	[An] entertaining psychodrama with a hissable villain and some satisfactory scares.
21964	0	a	It is a great, warm, hard, unforgiving, triumphant movie, and there is not a scene that does not shine with the love of the people who made it.
21965	1	a	This is mature, meaningful, thoroughly grown-up filmmaking that has something vitally important to say about the expanding effects of violence in society.
21966	5	a	amusing at times, but neither the story nor the lead actors give us enough to care or laugh about.
21967	0	a	Creepy time down south.
21968	4	a	Boys don't need to be the only ones having fun in an ultra-crass comedy.
21969	4	a	For good or for bad, this is not your run-of-the-mill animated feature.
21970	3	a	The film is well made, well acted, cleverly written, photographed by Wilfrid Sempe as if he's a conspirer with the sexual schemers.
21971	3	a	Watching it is like having your funny bone struck repeatedly, expertly and very much too hard by a karate super-black-belt capable of bringing a rhino to its knees with a single punch behind the ear.
21972	3	a	A shrewdly observed character piece accentuated by Tina Fey's likely career-best performance.
21973	1	a	Movies don't need to be better than the book. They only need to be the best movie version of the book. And Inherent Vice is that.
21974	4	a	For better and worse, the pieces comprising Must Love Dogs are borrowed from every other romantic comedy.
21975	3	a	A surprisingly funny and ingeniously clever take on superheroes ... The Green Hornet certainly sets the bar high for other superhero movies coming out this year.
21976	6	a	Constant sequences of drug taking, one after the other, does not a good film make.
21977	2	a	Anushka Sharma and her co-stars are ferociously good in this succinct thriller.
21978	4	a	Stambrini and her cinematographer, Fabio Cianchetti, give the proceedings a high-tech, energetic look that keeps the thrill and entertainment levels high.
21979	4	a	The scene with the fried chicken drumstick might cause Colonel Sanders to repurpose one of his famous buckets as a barf bag. 
21980	4	a	Angst-riddled yet assured debut by third-generational filmmaker Gia Coppola.
21981	6	a	[The film] isn't nearly as bad as it's been made out to be.
21982	3	a	Rango is Disney by way of Hunter S. Thompson, Chinatown recast with a lizard, Blazing Saddles with existential angst, Sergio Leone's spaghetti westerns romanticallyspoofed. Rango is both weird and wonderful.
21983	6	a	Makes a too obvious attempt to repeat [Cahill's] previous effort, wanting to be spooky and ending up soggy.
21984	5	a	A stunningly cheesy old sci-fi corn-fest.
21985	3	a	Luca Guadagnino's films are so tangible, you could live inside of them, and you'd be happy to stay there.
21986	3	a	For once, Farrell's bad-boy swagger fits nicely into a character. None of that silly Alexander blond-haired posing this time.
21987	6	a	We all lead lives of quiet desperation, though some of us are louder than others.
21988	7	a	Seeing it, one does get some sense that the Danish Emperor of Film is wearing no clothes.
21989	3	a	The best thing that can be said about this funny, poignant and compassionate film is that watching it is not work.
21990	1	a	Air Force One doesn't insult the audience. It is crafted by a film-maker who takes pride in the thrills and sly fun he packs into every frame.
21991	6	a	If Kate Hudson and Matthew McConaughey weren't so darn easy on the eyes, the only thing this 'battle of the sexes' film would be losing is its audience.
21992	5	a	Little is added that departs from the Bond formula.
21993	3	a	Macy, who has become, in himself, a reason to see any picture he's in, is superb as a man caught in a dilemma.
21994	0	a	A movie as good as anything [Sofia Coppola's] daddy ever made -- and yet Lost in Translation is a movie he could not have made if he tried.
21995	4	a	Alas, a sophisticated trajectory is cut short for an outcome that's cringingly earnest.
21996	3	a	"With ""All the President's Men"" forever emblazoned in our collective consciousness, it's fun, or at least illuminating, to see some of these same scenes from Deep Throat's point of view."
21997	1	a	Depicts an unlikely intersection of sports and leadership in ways that manage to be inspiring and insightful without ever becoming schmaltzy or preachy.
21998	4	a	If the late Aaron Spelling had lived long enough to produce Showtime's The Tudors, the result might have been something like The Other Boleyn Girl...
21999	9	a	I'm not about to argue with the message, but the delivery system sinks below the level of after-school special, and the acting matches.
22000	8	a	This is one of those utterly generic films that could easily have been spat out by some over-the-counter screenwriting software.
22001	2	a	Corbijn handles this surfeit of plot with ease, skillfully preserving the mystery of Issa's motives and creating an atmosphere of pervasive distrust.
22002	0	a	A dizzy, dusty masterpiece
22003	3	a	...a better-than-average behind-the-scenes drama that boasts a sterling turn from Busey and a whole lot of memorable music.
22004	5	a	It's fluff. But while its dim fantasies about Hitchcock and the association of genius with psychosis can be written off as silly, they also smack of spiteful jealousy.
22005	4	a	[T]he small achievement of Devil's Due is how much it both exploits the video-cam approach and overcomes some of its limitations.
22006	3	a	It feels like the kind of movie that would have been designed for Meryl Streep or Sigourney Weaver back in the day, ragged yet sumptuous, filled with moments for devastating monologues yet never so obvious as to be self-aggrandizing.
22007	1	a	The film is so alive, the performances so urgent and convincing, that it's as if Loach had just discovered the subject matter.
22008	3	a	Dares to question American values in the most inventive ways since Dr. Strangelove.
22009	5	a	it's all a muddle of a script that seems to have been constructed from the cinematic equivalent of baling wire and chewing gum. The cut-rate, generic chewing gum. The kind that doesn't really hold its snap.
22010	5	a	Irksome in its randomness, finding a few profound windows to the soul before it lurches back into shtick coma mode.
22011	4	a	It's a remarkably committed effort that takes a few seriously misguided turns along the way, even as its actors lunge at psychological depth with every scene.
22012	4	a	A corrective to all those family films and documentaries, many of them by Disney, that sentimentalise - and patronise - wild animals by trying to turn them into quirky, mentally subnormal humans.
22013	0	a	"An epic of desperation, clotted emotions, racism and innocence destroyed, ""Vazante"" is chillingly beautiful and thoroughly awful, stuffed with grief and tragedy while wrestling with the dynamics of power."
22014	6	a	While the movie shines at times, its surprisingly stale storyline keeps it from becoming an instant, stop-motion classic.
22015	3	a	The hard-to-predict and absolutely essential chemistry between the down-to-earth Bullock and the nonchalant Grant proves to be sensational, and everything meshes in this elegant entertainment.
22016	4	a	It's novel, it's amusing and it can't help but peter out in the third act as the screenplay trucks toward a Big Apple showdown between good and evil. By this time, Enchanted is merely coasting on Adams' considerable charm. It's enough.
22017	4	a	...familiar in its feel-good delivery...a solid student-athlete melodrama that creeps up on you more convincingly than a three-point shot at the buzzer
22018	3	a	"A movie that teaches respect for ""feelings"" through a cocky middle-aged NYC restaurateur who learns he is capable of love in relationship with a vivacious young woman."
22019	9	a	Most of this is soft-core nonsense, but snappy dialogue and design -- as well as the striptease routine that Fonda performs behind the opening credits -- have made it something of a cult favorite.
22020	4	a	The Australian style is the one that makes this a comedy of contrasts, of crazy characters and something special. [Full Review in Spanish]
22021	3	a	Sometimes the big studios get it right. Enchanted is a high-concept fish-out-of-water tale that works on so many levels it's dizzying. Plus, it features a breakout performance by the luminous Amy Adams.
22022	6	a	Has a lot to look at but little to actually watch. The plot is a standard 'cops go undercover to expose drug ring' story, and the characters have no personalities.
22023	1	a	An extravagantly ambitious movie that's easy to admire but a challenge to love.
22024	6	a	The special effects are pretty good and the fight scenes are adequate. But the film loses steam in the fourth act ...
22025	4	a	"Sometimes finding good-natured light laughs in the pain we all are experiencing breaks the tension. And ""Larry Crowne"" fits that bill pretty well."
22026	5	a	There's a whiff of pointlessness hanging over this whole affair. The fact that Valkyrie is not the thriller the trailer promises is treason against the talent.
22027	2	a	We live on the fault line along with these characters, and it is an experience that is not easy to shake off.
22028	3	a	The movie finds its rhythm as it goes, toggling between the sheer terror and adrenaline of embedding in the world's ugliest conflicts, and the murkier traumas of bringing that knowledge back home.
22029	5	a	Rafelson shows that he can't handle noir themes as easily as the real masters of the genre.
22030	6	a	The script and acting satisfy the genre's requirements by being thoroughly forgettable.
22031	3	a	Reno himself can take credit for most of the movie's success. He's one of the few 'cool' actors who never seems aware of his own coolness.
22032	2	a	Writer/director Trey Edward Shults is a dab hand at creating an atmosphere of uncertainty and menace and does a fine job of showing how people disintegrate under duress. The performances are very convincing here.
22033	0	a	Into it Director Alfred Hitchcock, whose unmistakable stamp the picture bears, has packed about as much romantic action, melodramatic hullabaloo, comical diversion and illusion of momentous consequence as the liveliest imagination could conceive.
22034	9	a	If this were a good movie, we would cheer for the students to dodge the flaming arrows. This isn't a good movie. 
22035	3	a	The story unfolds in Israeli director Nati Baratz's intriguing, beautifully filmed documentary Unmistaken Child, which records Tenzin Zopa's search and its aftermath.
22036	3	a	It feels like the backstory behind half the world's wayward kids.
22037	4	a	Mild Mild Mess
22038	4	a	The movie has a flimsy plot, but who cares? Barney, one of the most popular television characters in history, is what viewers want to see, and there's plenty of him.
22039	4	a	Anchored by two superb performances, the film becomes slightly more engaging than it has any right to.
22040	8	a	While not as well known as Rocky, Shock Treatment features all the hallmarks of Richard O'Brien's madcap genius. 
22041	5	a	At one point [Ryan] actually embraces a coffee vending machine as if it were a buoy in the rocky ocean of life. Is this a performance or a cry for a new script?
22042	4	a	Piling tragedy upon tragedy until it collapses under the weight, the fourth narrative feature from Derek Cianfrance makes a flagrant play for your heartstrings.
22043	4	a	For all its evasions, short cuts, and mismanaged ideas, Selma can't be dismissed. Its modest achievements engross.
22044	5	a	There is lots of menace; little magic; and a growing sense that this film could be sent straight out to schools, where minds in need of learning won't be corrupted by nuance, flair or artistry.
22045	3	a	"Overall, ""How Do You Know"" is a cozy diversion, an upscale date-night movie."
22046	5	a	Such an astonishing, crucial life as Turing's deserves a more courageous, inventive film. Not this opportunistic, King's Speech -like Oscar grab.
22047	1	a	Sorrentino is an exceptional visual stylist and the imagery within this film is startling...
22048	5	a	Failure to Launch is yet another disposable romantic comedy made with little thought or skill.
22049	3	a	Misogyny, tradition, innocence and experience are among the themes given a sophisticated treatment herein.
22050	4	a	A wonderful savage satire on high school life.
22051	9	a	Possibly the greatest waste of celluloid since Jerry Lewis was first allowed to stand before a camera.
22052	3	a	This isn't a 'religious movie.' But it's about characters who do indeed have religion in their lives.
22053	6	a	The direction by Richard Donner ... is usually a beat or two off, and the dialogue seems clumsily ad-libbed.
22054	0	a	As is typical with Zhang's films, this one is gripping and leaves you with admiration for the brave souls who survive under totalitarian rule.
22055	4	a	"In some ways, ""Christopher Robin"" might be better suited for a night out for Mom and Dad rather than a Saturday afternoon with the whole family, but it's doubtful that's what Disney is hoping for."
22056	6	a	What is it about that big purple dinosaur?
22057	4	a	While not entirely successful, there's enough humor and humanism amid gritty urban locations to recommend Gridlock'd.
22058	3	a	Disney's gloriously tongue-in-cheek parody of its own princess genre is notable for how it's G-rated heroine makes us realize how far a bit of innocence and optimism can uplift our outlook in today's untrusting world.
22059	4	a	"Almodovar shoots himself in the foot with a too-tricky structure, resetting ""Skin"" with a new set of characters at about the halfway point."
22060	5	a	Neil Patrick Harris owns the movie's funniest scene, involving not one, but two bowler hats and no relief in sight.
22061	2	a	American Violet is an earnest muckraker about the justice system that won't win points for style, but wins plenty for substance.
22062	6	a	Brisseau's filmmaking style is artful and clever ... so it's a pity when he begins to wallow in corny moralising and operatic excesses.
22063	9	a	It's hard to know if more convincing relationships would have made a difference in a movie so committed to funny accents and potty jokes, but at least it would have shown some effort.
22064	1	a	Few movies live up to their title, but this romantic comedy is indeed just about as good as it gets.
22065	3	a	Stephen King seems to be working his way through the reference books of human phobias, and Cat's Eye is one of his most effective films.
22066	0	a	Killer Joe will both infuriate and impress, but when it impresses there is nothing quite like it. It plays on the senses and lingers in the mind, McConaughey is brilliant and Friedkin finds himself in his best form in years
22067	4	a	Better not operate any heavy machinery after an eyeful of Crank: High Voltage
22068	3	a	An intelligent and well-crafted film that seeks to inspire audiences by finding the humor amid the prevailing bittersweetness of life. 
22069	0	a	More Vice City than Miami Vice: Mann's new thriller makes for sweet, sweet action ...
22070	4	a	"To its own narrative detriment, ""The Hobbit"" works hard to lay the framework for what will follow. Certainly that's one way to set out on a trilogy, but it's surely not the best."
22071	2	a	A story about a third act that begins to come undone in its own third act.
22072	6	a	There's not really a movie there, nothing that sustains itself from scene to scene and nothing that's worth watching from beginning to end.
22073	6	a	A romance found wanting thanks to watered down chemistry between the stars. 
22074	0	a	...a serious, slowly paced but utterly masterful slice of American history.
22075	7	a	Its half-baked political ideas take away from the wholly satisfying and surreal Pixar riff it could have been.
22076	6	a	When the starting point is a world in which even the toughest guys wear their hearts on their sleeves, the trick for filmmakers is how to walk the line without getting stuck in the muck, and that is a problem the filmmaker hasn't yet figured out.
22077	3	a	This is a human drama that invites you to think, not just about the technicalities and the philosophies behind code-breaking, but also the social and psychological themes.
22078	6	a	Corbijn has assembled a fine cast of performers, yet still comes up with a disjointed jigsaw puzzle. Playing unfocused spy games in A Most Wanted Man leaves this peek-a-boo thriller feeling tired and unwanted.
22079	4	a	A charming, witty and wholly generic high school romcom, the film succeeds thanks to its smart script and sympathetic performances.
22080	6	a	It's all rather pleasant, but it's also all rather conventional.
22081	4	a	Not every incredible story makes a compelling movie.
22082	5	a	"It's kind of frightening that it took three writers to come up with this ""plot""."
22083	4	a	Based on the play by poet/activist Hughes, this updated faith-based tale features rousing musical numbers and a well-meaning, if predictable, story, marked by unlikely coincidences.
22084	4	a	The stories are cleverly interwoven, with a couple of unexpected twists, and the patient viewer is rewarded with a doozy of a car chase in the last reel.
22085	6	a	It's a journey full of good intentions, but also some dubious decisions.
22086	7	a	"I have always respected, if not always liked, the works of Almodovar and I am disappointed in him for making a film like ""The Skin I Live In."" It left a sour taste in my mouth and feeling like I needed a shower afterward."
22087	6	a	When we do feel a warm fuzzy in the heart or a lump in the throat, we also see everything Crowe did to put it there.
22088	9	a	This Ed Wood is dead wood.
22089	3	a	Selma wisely sidesteps predictable inspirational-movie cliches: Deep down, this film knows that the more things change, the more they stay the same. And there is still much work to be done.
22090	3	a	An excellent piece of entertainment. The cast is undeniably brilliant.
22091	5	a	A bunch of guys past their prime punching and kicking each other and pretending its for our benefit, when its really just one last self-congratulatory hurrah.
22092	4	a	An intelligent, quiet work from a master filmmaker.
22093	3	a	Jennifer Westfeldt once again proves she has a way of examining aspects of everyday life that can be appreciated even by those not in that same situation.
22094	3	a	A combination of unstuffy dialogue, wise casting, unselfconscious performances and sensuous but never pretty photography makes Campion's version of the nineteenth century feel current but not anachronistic.
22095	1	a	Nothing new here, just four highly polished performances, a kiss and a tear at the end, and black ink on the bottom line. 
22096	5	a	It is difficult to say anything about the plot without giving away the ending, simply because the ending is apparent within the first half hour of the movie.
22097	1	a	First Reformed can hardly imagine a hopeful future for the world, [yet] the film is full of longing for redemption... Toller hopes that his journal is a kind of prayer. Perhaps Schrader hopes the same for his film.
22098	3	a	"An unexpectedly great start to the prequel to ""LOTR""; Peter Jackson strikes again."
22099	4	a	The crisp look director Thor Freudenthal brings to the visuals isn't matched in its story or its characters, all of whom, including the dogs, lack a special zip.
22100	4	a	There's a high enough feelgood factor here to compensate for the detours off the comedy highway.
22101	4	a	Not for one frame does it seem possible that these two cutesy twenty-somethings won't see the errors of their wagers in time to take the exit to happily-ever-after land.
22102	9	a	Identity Thief features the kind of 'humour' which says you don't just hit a person once, you should do it repeatedly to make it funnier.
22103	3	a	Nolan has handed himself a difficult task by tackling a complicated, often downbeat story with two cold, central figures. ... But Nolan, like Angier and Borden, has no shortage of tricks up his sleeve...
22104	4	a	Features two irresistible lead characters -- and you can't always say that about a movie.
22105	5	a	Although I do think PP fans will be satisfied with the finale, let's hope this is the last redux for these pitches.
22106	0	a	Raiders of the Lost Ark could be a silent film at times, because Spielberg favors actions over words, telling his story with great camerawork. [Full review in Spanish]
22107	5	a	McGuigan goes for easy wins throughout, doggedly incurious about his own characters, underlining the literal-minded script, repeating entire scenes in case anyone missed the point.
22108	2	a	"Though not particularly groundbreaking or memorable, ""Diary of a Wimpy Kid"" definitely exceeds the standards for a modern family film and it's almost guaranteed to entertain any kid who goes to see it."
22109	3	a	... sometimes, method acting is its own worst enemy. Theron is very, very good ... but many close-ups seem almost calculated to keep reminding us of just how extraordinarily her appearance has been changed.
22110	2	a	An amiable comedy that simultaneously manages to spoof these popular futuristic space adventures and replicate the very elements that have made them so durable.
22111	7	a	Hart has to deliver a spectacular highlight every time he touches the ball for this movie to have any chance, and as a result, he takes some ill-advised shots.
22112	0	a	One of the very best films of the year.
22113	4	a	While it is not uncommon for Serious Actors to lighten up and make a film their kids can see, it is nonetheless jarring to see someone on the level of Don Cheadle turn up in a January-released, kiddie animal programmer.
22114	4	a	Its emotional impact is undeniable, though you may resent the film for hooking you the way it does.
22115	0	a	Coming-of-age classic still a must-see for teens.
22116	4	a	Eminem's skill still lies in turning an inventive phrase: filled with characters who lack depth, his film debut falls victim to its own modesty and is often insubstantial and boring.
22117	2	a	Does The Bourne Identity hang together as a taut spy thriller? Not completely. But Matt certainly delivers a summer punch.
22118	5	a	we're merely left waiting to see when the Fatal Attraction plot points will finally take over and what creative way Kanganis will come up with next to get Ford out of her top.
22119	0	a	There are still a lot of good movies slated for November and December, but it's hard to imagine anything topping the Coen brothers' chiller-thriller No Country for Old Men.
22120	3	a	When the guy who made Saving Private Ryan uses the word 'war' in a title, audiences should believe him. War of the Worlds is brutal.
22121	6	a	Never has so much talent been wasted with so little imagination.
22122	2	a	The cast is clearly just here to have a good time, and the audience will, too.
22123	4	a	Essentially as meaty as a Saturday Night Live skit-turned-feature film but is also mercifully short and pretty well-paced.
22124	6	a	Not as disposable as we first think, and ultimately watchable once we get past an hour that's only marginally less damaging than a 'Diff'rent Strokes' marathon - but it's not exactly inspired either.
22125	2	a	Even though Defamation, which is sprinkled with unexpected moments of wry humor, will be inescapably controversial, Yoav Shamir strives admirably to be evenhanded.
22126	3	a	Even more of a joy ride than the original.
22127	3	a	Sam Rockwell...[is] without doubt one of the best actors of his generation. [Full Review in Spanish]
22128	4	a	Field is at the top of her game, and you will cringe, worry, fear and cheer for Doris.
22129	3	a	The movie isn't great art, but it has been made with great taste and style; it's more intelligent and observant than movie biographies of singing stars used to be.
22130	4	a	Most of the effort seems to have gone into the original music, which is pleasant but not memorable, and too little on creating believable, multidimensional characters.
22131	4	a	a lot of dirty-minded snickers, but not as many genuine laughs as you might have hoped for.
22132	4	a	"A breezy, lightweight account of the making of a classic. Some of the casting may be questionable, but in the end it's the ""cattle"" who carry it."
22133	7	a	Be prepared to collapse into a hoot and a howl of hilarity at all the wrong moments.
22134	5	a	The rain in Payne falls on dialogue inane.
22135	6	a	Perhaps the sequel - if we ever get there - will fill in the gaps and expand on John Carter's legend now all the expositional heavy-lifting has been done. But is that an acceptable excuse for an epic to be this underwhelming?
22136	4	a	All that distinguishes Fast Five from this year's crop of crappy action films is a modicum of craft, cleverness and restraint.
22137	5	a	Viewers who are old enough to eat without a bib are unlikely to find much of interest in the procession of puns and generic zero-gravity gags that fill out the film's running time.
22138	9	a	A painful, sluggish black hole of simultaneous bad ideas and no ideas at all.
22139	4	a	Bloated...overlong. Even Shakespeare needs editing.
22140	4	a	Alas, it never quite reaches that gaga level that would truly send it over the top, but this disaster flick is hardly disastrous.
22141	3	a	A cute little cartoon that ought to please very young children.
22142	4	a	A lot of flash and outlandish events tossed together in a haphazard fashion that's just not as funny as the filmmakers obviously thought it would be.
22143	5	a	Better than the first, but still overrated.
22144	2	a	I don't want to give anything away, but eventually audience members who are paying attention might conclude that Menashe isn't simply having a run of bad luck.
22145	5	a	Certainly Bee Movie could've been smarter, faster, and far cleverer, and it's disappointing to watch Seinfeld settle for less. For a man who made a mint reveling in comedic risk on a weekly basis, his first movie lacks serious sting.
22146	6	a	Innocuous and mild mannered
22147	3	a	tows the line of conventional, feel-good Hollywood rom-com, albeit dressed up in just enough art-house quirk to make it feel like something slightly radical
22148	6	a	That the lead character is a 'male cow' complete with udders shows how confused the picture is.
22149	3	a	...dual character study of two alienated siblings with an ironic interdependency. If the film ultimately feels small, Linney and Hoffman, two of our great actors, always keep it interesting.
22150	5	a	[Alpha Dog is] intermittently bemused or tragic, but utterly lacking a conscience or a point of view.
22151	5	a	Hook breaks the cardinal rule of J.M. Barrie's timeless fantasy -- it grows up.
22152	2	a	Liman does such a superb job with the pacing of the film that you almost forget about how little substance there is.
22153	1	a	Both actors deliver award worthy performances and I hope their work here is remembered at the end of the year.
22154	4	a	Gosling and McGregor deliver beyond-the-call-of-duty performances that hold you riveted even when the story goes silly.
22155	8	a	If, as Fincher has said, this movie is supposed to be funny, then the joke's on us.
22156	7	a	It's a film without twists, where everything is what it seems, and when the mess has been resolved, it's even at a loss for a proper denouement. Armored just ends-and with it, so does the access to plush chairs and free air conditioning.
22157	5	a	The overriding feeling with John Carter is that there is an epic film to be made from this material, but this just isn't it.
22158	6	a	Contains more miraculous conversions than a revival.
22159	6	a	Has some sporadic laughs, but Ben and especially his roommates are just too gross to be the kind of charming free spirits Apatow thinks they are.
22160	6	a	Most of the way, the film's deficiencies are survivable if only for Jennifer Lawrence and some fleeting moments of emotional clarity and bracing conflict.
22161	6	a	MacFarlane is doomed to keep making mediocre comedies until he enlists the services of a competent editor...
22162	9	a	This movie should drown itself.
22163	6	a	Many of the characters seemed more like sketches of characters rather than real people.
22164	6	a	If Penn weren't such an intimidating figure, studio execs probably would have turned the script back and asked for a do-over.
22165	5	a	The funny stuff at the heart of this film struggles in vain to free itself from a cage made of old romantic-comedy cliches.
22166	3	a	The novelty fades and one might be watching a somewhat run of the mill silent. Still the experience brings back memories of some great silent movies.
22167	9	a	This is one of the least scary, dumbest movies I've seen in a long time.
22168	4	a	Gandini's voiceover is a little ponderous, but, aptly for a film about the primacy of the image, he lets the pictures, many of them deliberately awkward tableaux, others bordering on absurdist, do most of the work.
22169	3	a	Great sci-fi with a surprisingly environmentalist message -- you have to wonder if Heston paid close attention.
22170	3	a	If you can separate - or rescue - It's a Wonderful Life from its niche as a Christmas classic, you might discover a film that swings wildly from noirlike starkness to saccharine bathos.
22171	4	a	It's refreshing to see Burton in a relatively upbeat mood, but he picked the wrong story to give an optimistic spin.
22172	4	a	Much less than the sum of its stylish parts, but for a while there, it'll curl your hair, or your toes, or whatever it is you've got that curls up when you're getting the holy popcorn scared out of you.
22173	6	a	Fails to capture either the sprightly spirit and poignant pathos of its subject's famous works.
22174	6	a	Still Alice is so busy being compassionate that it forgets to be anything else.
22175	1	a	Wildly entertaining.
22176	3	a	Fincher has delivered a visually striking, well-acted, at times stomach-churning thriller, but I still can't help but wish that he had taken a curve ball and continued exploring new territory rather than taking a big swing at an easy toss 
22177	3	a	Amy Adams shines in this fabulous fable about what happens when the fairy tale world takes a bite out of the Big Apple.
22178	7	a	Witless, charmless, clumsy and appallingly unenjoyable, The Green Hornet is almost unrecognizable as having come from the same, endlessly inventive storehouse of creativity as Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind.
22179	3	a	In many ways, Galaxy Quest is more fantasy than science fiction. It's a lighthearted romp.
22180	5	a	Evelyn may be based on a true and historically significant story, but the filmmakers have made every effort to disguise it as an unimaginative screenwriter's invention.
22181	9	a	It's worse than bad. It's mediocre.
22182	9	a	I think it should be considered child abuse to inflict this tripe upon children.
22183	5	a	einai apo aytes tis tainies poy se xaideyoyne epibrabeytika sto kefali, h anamesa sta mpoytia, giati exeis akoysta ton Cole Porter kai ton F. Scott Fitzgerald
22184	9	a	Too phony to be anything truly heartfelt.
22185	6	a	While the theme of 'what are you doing with your life?' resonates, it's not much fun to watch, in spite of splendid performances from all concerned.
22186	4	a	Old enough that many of the anime techniques used herein have become cliche -- but still has a cool enough story to be worth a look.
22187	4	a	As much as I laughed throughout the movie, I cannot mount a cogent defense of the film as entertainment, or even performance art, although the movie does leave you marveling at these guys' superhuman capacity to withstand pain.
22188	6	a	In other words, ''CQ'' triumphs over its own trendiness only by being vapid and superficial.
22189	9	a	A video game cum movie that substitutes shrieking decibel levels for a coherent plot and any resemblance to originality.
22190	1	a	Knocked Up is a knockout.
22191	6	a	A silly, forgettable comedy...
22192	9	a	[A] crass, trashy and none-too-funny comedy.
22193	2	a	The jokes come thick and fast and hit and miss just as frequently.
22194	5	a	The question is, could someone turn these full-frontal-dudity snapshots into a satisfying, cohesive movie? Answer: no, but not for lack of trying.
22195	5	a	Despite some gruesomely colorful sets, a few scares and Sid Haig's droll performance as the wise-cracking Captain Spaulding, the disjointed narrative is as messy as the blood-splattered corpses littering the film.
22196	6	a	The Predator is quite fun if you can appreciate the silliness since it doesn't take itself seriously, but unfortunately, the lack of seriousness is also its own detriment.
22197	5	a	Mother and Child winds up with some very mixed messages.
22198	6	a	The film is so truncated, so obsessed with style and composed of so many self-contained episodes that it fails to say anything new.
22199	3	a	Superman II is a marvelous toy.
22200	5	a	In the wake of Scream, Jason X is a post-modern horror film that comes off as just a little too post.
22201	4	a	Despite other flashes of brilliance, De Palma ends up undermining his film with a drawn-out, mega-melodramatic ending that would seem over the top at the Metropolitan Opera.
22202	3	a	Roos combines a sharp script with excellent performances and comfortably lived-in sets to produce a cornucopia of poignantly human interludes.
22203	5	a	Felt, the grandee who became the informer known as Deep Throat, is played by a rigid Liam Neeson in a bad wig; no room is found for humour or pithy period details.
22204	0	a	"My Life to Live"" has just as much social currency today as the day it was released if its gangster trope ending lets Godard off the hook all too easy. "
22205	1	a	War of the Worlds is thoughtful, but don't let that worry you. This is an action film concerned more with delivering thrills than making bold statements.
22206	2	a	Neither the best nor the worst of the Jane Austen adaptations. However, nor is it likely to be remembered for very long after it passes across your eyes.
22207	2	a	The real hero of this film is Steven Spielberg. It's not the best Spielberg film out there, but there are pieces of it that are truly monumental.
22208	6	a	Fans of historical dramas may love it, but you're in trouble when theories about the sun and earth are more involving than the interpersonal dramas.
22209	4	a	"An example of performances transcending the motion picture they are in, ""American Hustle"" excels when observing its human figures in all of their honest and pretend forms."
22210	8	a	Carol is a quiet movie, choosing to let something blossom on its own instead of forcing of it. 
22211	4	a	"The film is choppy at times and its time line a little squiggly, but ""Cadillac Records"" should please as a celebration of the best of the Blues and the birth of Rock 'n Roll."
22212	8	a	Kelly Fremon Craig [has created] what is a true gem of a movie that has the hallmarks of a bonafide cult classic, which proves that she's truly a talent to watch out for.
22213	3	a	The cast is terrific. Tim Allen, Sigourney Weaver, Alan Rickman and Tony Shalhoub are familiar faces, and look so out of their depth in the middle of all this silliness that of course we find ourselves smirking.
22214	8	a	One of the most irritating movies of the year, features non-stop phoning.
22215	6	a	Parker does occasionally make us forget that Failure to Launch is so bereft of comic ideas that it ultimately stoops to giving Terry Bradshaw a nude scene to milk a laugh.
22216	9	a	Amounts to a two-hour torture session that would make one long for the great beyond.
22217	3	a	An extremely entertaining vehicle, a testosterone-filled escape. It's a slam-bang way to begin the summer.
22218	4	a	The movie might not be anywhere near as good as its reputation suggests, but as a straight-up cowboy flick with moments of light comic relief, it's a fairly fun picture.
22219	6	a	There is hardly a single credible character other than the Pope, and... not a single situation that isn't cheerfully forced for maximum sweetness.
22220	2	a	Even the familiar scenes and situations look refreshing.
22221	2	a	As before, the language is a bear, the sight gags grisly and your reactions polar. But this time there's also a surprising amount of heart. 
22222	8	a	A wince-inducing comedic atrocity.
22223	3	a	A thriller that actually lives up to its trailer.
22224	9	a	This is not so much a review as an inquiry into memory, as I attempt to recover the one tiny redeeming virtue.
22225	4	a	"The cast is the only winning ensemble ""The Dressmaker"" needs."
22226	3	a	Sorrentino has managed to build a loving and distinctive work on the foundation of an indolent, often self-loathing social strata. 
22227	1	a	This Country is for anyone who loves movies.
22228	1	a	The Prestige is about dueling magicians, but the movie itself is the magic trick.
22229	6	a	[...]it's always nice to see someone revisit Christopher Reeves' drunken Man of Steel act from Superman III.
22230	6	a	Watching Valentino: The Last Emperor is a little like gorging on chocolate and Champagne.
22231	3	a	...boasts a number of genuinely exhilarating sequences and set-pieces.
22232	6	a	An engorged melodrama meant to evoke the dark passions of country blues, Black Snake Moan often comes off like Britney Spears singing Skip James.
22233	2	a	In the romantic comedy department, Two Weeks is smarter than it needs to be.
22234	3	a	Sausage Party is rude, funny and unexpectedly profound in places, with the juvenile humour leavened by some thoughtful commentary on modern life.
22235	4	a	Unapologetically soulful stuff, almost provocative in its lack of irony.
22236	4	a	Deeply unsettling, occasionally exasperating movie.
22237	5	a	It's consistent with the duller examples of Hollywood's animated output.
22238	4	a	Hems and haws with only an occasional cinematic punch, making it a good, but very expected journey. 
22239	0	a	It's a unique trip that flirts with hokeyness at the surface but that grows more compelling, awe-inspiring, and tragic the deeper you go.
22240	1	a	"Wholly original and brand new, director Ciro Guerra's ""Embrace of the Serpent"" immediately feels like some kind of lost classic, a movie that has been around for a long time but only talked about in film circles, finally unearthed."
22241	4	a	...a well acted piece and a scary indictment of the American penal system.
22242	6	a	There's so little reason behind the plot that it's hard to focus on Foster's fierce performance.
22243	3	a	"Some may consider ""Agora"" sound history, others may label it heresy, but I call it thumping good drama."
22244	6	a	If only someone could've heroically intervened to save this movie.
22245	3	a	Shadow of the Vampire has a weird, flickering magic that is hard to dispel.
22246	6	a	Theater projectionists could do moviegoers an immense favor by putting a splice in place of the second act, perhaps the worst in film history.
22247	5	a	Remember the classic comedy The Odd Couple? This is sort of the same movie, only it's the odd triple and it isn't funny.
22248	6	a	Overall, Miami Vice is a modestly entertaining action fix for long-time fans of the TV series, but isn't the expert, polished film I expected from the mature Mann.
22249	6	a	The Bourne Supremacy offers both brains and brawn, but without the ability to enjoy any of the action, the film falls to mediocre levels.
22250	3	a	Crimson Peak is the perfect film for that small subgroup of moviegoers that doesn't see shivers and manic giggling as incompatible.
22251	4	a	The movie is such an immersive portrayal of an insular world rarely seen onscreen that the thin story isn't a major problem. 
22252	6	a	Factory Girl, a biography of Edie Sedgwick, the most glamorous of Andy Warhol's so-called superstars, suggests a magazine layout masquerading as a film.
22253	5	a	Tacky, sloppy genre exercise about how when screws are loose, even children can be psychotic.
22254	2	a	Alternately wildly funny, wildly romantic, wildly satiric, and, at the same time, dark and tragic 
22255	6	a	Relatively speaking, Jurassic Park III is a disappointment of behemoth proportions.
22256	4	a	For fans of Demme's work, however, or those who are looking for comedy that's off the beaten path, Married to the Mob might fill the bill.
22257	5	a	Can she escape his clutches, find her child and solve the mystery? And do we care?
22258	3	a	A fun romp with some genuinely chilling shocks.
22259	3	a	With what is arguably Matthew McConaughey's best performance to date, Killer Joe is easily one of the most memorable films of the year. You won't soon forget it. Even if you want to. 
22260	4	a	Fans keyed into Eastwood's gentle past work might be more inclined to sit back and allow the filmmaker to find his own way, even if that means a few melodramatic rough patches and a bizarrely pat ending. 
22261	4	a	Throughout, Bardem ... is a potent presence.
22262	5	a	What attracted audiences to seeing a film about couples and their relationships with the first film may want to avoid a sequel that has less humor, romance and any substance.
22263	0	a	Into the Wild takes your heart and shakes it, offering inspiration, exasperation and blunt realization in a true story of one young man's dream and nightmare.
22264	1	a	It has an enviable level of clarity and plausibility while dynamically satisfying the conventions and requirements of the thriller.
22265	3	a	Unlike John Singleton's by-the-numbers Boyz n the Hood, Boaz Yakin's Fresh doesn't rely on skeletal portrayals of life in the ghetto, or moralistic messages.
22266	4	a	The movie is also burdened by some amateurish acting in supporting roles, but Mackie and Jonathan are the real deal, and they get good support from Wayne Brady as a smarmy sports agent.
22267	4	a	"The most important word in the title of The Curious Case of Benjamin Button is ""curious."
22268	6	a	The contrived secondary characters, like the local villain who hopes to run Radio out of town, and yet another overblown score by James Horner keep it from truly succeeding.
22269	3	a	Strong sexual content, adult themes in gay romance. 
22270	2	a	A winning comedy that's as leisurely as the Eisenhower years, with just a hint of the rebellion that's coming down the pike.
22271	3	a	A bright and breezy piece.
22272	4	a	If nothing else, all the sleaze gets your attention in this neglected cult film and keeps you interested even if it repels you.
22273	4	a	"Where ""Final Fantasy: The Spirits Within"" falters is not in the stunning visuals, but in its pedestrian script"
22274	3	a	The honesty, restraint and emotional power of Aniston's performance help overcome the film's snobbishness.
22275	2	a	Cumberbatch has the ability to spin Turing's absence of tact into comedy and pathos.
22276	5	a	It would have made a great episode of The Twilight Zone, but feature length is too much for its premise.
22277	0	a	The story almost comes off the rails, but Beetlejuice's charm lies more in the execution. The movie is crammed with visual invention and snappy comedy.
22278	2	a	Not the best Bond movie ever but a very good one; a little darker but still unsettled as to what type overall it wants to be.
22279	0	a	DuVernay has done a great service with Selma. Not only has she made one of the most powerful films of the year, she's given us a necessary reminder of what King did for this country...and how much is left to be done.
22280	9	a	Leaves you wondering how things could have gone this wrong for a team of first-rate talents.
22281	3	a	It's never less than worthy and entertaining, but the importance of Invictus doesn't broaden as it goes along. It narrows.
22282	5	a	A schizophrenic film that is never funny, never insightful and often annoying.
22283	4	a	The true treat is watching Hannibal's evolution -- and witnessing the moment when his last shred of humanity disappears.
22284	4	a	With no star names and a tough subject, it will be hard sell despite being a runaway hit on its home turf.
22285	0	a	What is most amazing about this film is how completely Spielberg serves his story. The movie is brilliantly acted, written, directed and seen.
22286	1	a	It's a mad, mad, mad, mad, meaningful world, indeed.
22287	5	a	Tries with all its might to be no fun whatsoever.
22288	7	a	A few actors such as Clint Eastwood, marry substance and popularity. But very few. Most actors' egos lead them to slum in the box office. I'm reminded of this often when a major, talented actor opts for popularity instead of substance when the latter beck
22289	2	a	Christopher learns too late that one must love and fear nature in equal measure and that happiness is meaningless without someone with whom to share it.
22290	3	a	Its an actor's/writer's movie, but, oh, what acting and writing
22291	4	a	With this cast doing its own singing, and history this rich, it's close enough for rock 'n' roll.
22292	9	a	Each year, I happily endure much at the movies that most people are smart enough to avoid, and I am telling you that watching Lawrence here is a punishment.
22293	4	a	It may not work as a full-fledged spy thriller or as an identity crisis pot boiler yet, thanks to Liman's near effortless direction, the genre gumbo is top notch nonetheless.
22294	1	a	My Big Fat Greek Wedding is a jubilant mix of laughter, longing, forgiveness, sacrifice, commitment and, above all, balancing family obligations against true love.
22295	3	a	Connery's Bond was never better than this.
22296	3	a	Full of character-based suspense, it's dramatic and ramped-up with tension.
22297	4	a	Mild as milk and, at times, slower than August traffic heading to L.L. Bean. Good cast, though.
22298	3	a	Now might not sound like a great time for a movie about a teenager fuming over nonsense teenage problems. But at least in temperament, Hailee Steinfeld's Nadine is our spirit animal. 
22299	5	a	The film left me with an empty feeling...
22300	6	a	Every time [Alba] dives into the ocean, you expect to see her bobbing back up to the surface like an old plank.
22301	6	a	The film has an excellent pedigree, but when it poops it stinks of a Tim Allen movie.
22302	1	a	It's as much a treat for adults as for children, with humor that spans all age ranges and careens from sophisticated to just plain silly.
22303	3	a	Documentary dramatizations usually are awful, but in Ghosts of the Abyss, they work.
22304	7	a	... there's no suspense or tension and little gallows humor, merely dead space between the next spectacular spray of blood and body parts.
22305	0	a	"Selma"" is vital correspondence, filmmaking lived on the streets where brutal facts were ignored then reported, and now snatched back from history to sustain a spirit few films can or will possess."
22306	3	a	...if you are a fan of any of the musicians ... or maybe I should say if you're completely unfamiliar with any of the musicians mentioned - then Soul Power is well worth seeing. Or at least hearing.
22307	3	a	Fincher delivers a seedily compulsive glimpse into a cold, brutal universe seething with twisted passions, even if the story is little more than a slick, sick potboiler.
22308	4	a	Utter trash that's trashy enough to be mildly amusing.
22309	6	a	A didactic and dull documentary glorifying software anarchy.
22310	6	a	For every sharp one-liner or bright sight gag, there are five clunkers, including played-out references to Russell Crowe's phone-throwing incident and a lazy jab at Michael Jackson's fondness for little boys.
22311	0	a	Brilliant and highly influential.
22312	3	a	Mara's performance has a ferocity that will linger in your mind long after the two or three endings have faded.
22313	6	a	The writers ... have ideas that could be funny, but they don't follow through on any of them.
22314	4	a	Typical, typical Ernest nonsense, cookie cutter funny.
22315	0	a	"The ""Vertigo"" shot created for this film was so powerful and unique that everytime I see it used today, I get teary eyed."
22316	2	a	Makes an agreeable screen mess of emotions and impulses, carried largely by an ensemble clearly enjoying the opportunity to send up the foibles of coupledom.
22317	5	a	Yvonne Strahovski makes for one of the least believable big screen scientists since Denise Richards' infamous turn as Dr. Christmas Jones.
22318	4	a	still an overabundance of potty humor but as far as this franchise goes, I'll take improvements in baby steps
22319	4	a	This is not a movie about people. It's about cars going very, very fast.
22320	4	a	It's an interesting, character-driven film, the story of a woman who has a fight on her hands when it comes to her chosen career.
22321	3	a	For those with a thirst for a gripping political thriller with its roots in real-life events, Thirteen Days represents a satisfying refreshment.
22322	3	a	Even if the story about a dust bowl town's diminished water supply isn't quite thrilling enough, the film makes up for it with wacked-out dream sequences and a general oddball tone
22323	1	a	I have not seen anyone quite like Fierstein in the movies, and the fact that he is a specific individual gives this material a charm and weight it might have lacked if an interchangeable actor had played the role.
22324	4	a	Mars - in this case - needs more than moms.
22325	4	a	It's well played with a cast who are far smarter than your average 'slasher' movie players. And as for calling it a 'slasher movie' as it's been dubbed by some - it isn't really.
22326	3	a	A solid cast delivers in a movie that is thoroughly enjoyable if not consistently great.
22327	3	a	Film Stars Don't Die in Liverpool contains upper-echelon work from everyone involved and is a powerful portrait of Hollywood love that never gets unbearably mushy.
22328	1	a	The screenplay by Tony Gilroy ... cuts Ludlum's convolutions down to size, improves his leaden dialogue vastly and distills the action of the book to its essence.
22329	4	a	The portrayal of Hitchcock is the obvious centerpiece, and while Anthony Hopkin's temperament is not quite lugubrious or phlegmatic enough, we eventually see past it.
22330	5	a	While the dragons come out blazing, the rest of the movie is blowing smoke.
22331	4	a	Everyone in this picture takes himself or herself far too seriously as if to prove that if you don't crack a smile or burst into laughter at the silliness of the plot, you must be a darn good actor.
22332	3	a	It's shameless, I know, but this movie is nice, simple fun.
22333	5	a	After this lackluster outing, the thought of a sequel is a stretch even Mr. Fantastic might not be able to make.
22334	0	a	Isolated in the Lombardy region of Italy in a villa tucked away from the sexual politics of America, the tension of the film arises not purely from the proscribed sexuality but rather the intellectual foreplay.
22335	6	a	Weird does not necessarily equal funny.
22336	3	a	More high nostalgia than high art, it is what it wants to be: an on-screen feel-good easily digestible celebration of beloved fandoms.
22337	3	a	A tasty romantic comedy, featuring the battle of the sexes in its most fanciful light.
22338	3	a	Penn's film displays a deep and abiding love for America, set against a critique of the uglier aspects that exist alongside all that the beauty.
22339	9	a	There's no wicked fun left in this series.
22340	3	a	Fritz Lang's last American movie is an edgy study in moral ambiguity.
22341	4	a	A film that tries to mix full-out Brit humor with some deep messages about men trying to get their feelings of self-worth back. Unfortunately, it's oil and water.
22342	3	a	A simple road trip that becomes something much bigger, much broader, and much deeper-a tale of fathers and sons and families and the many shades of grey in the wide spectrum of love.
22343	3	a	Benjamin's very blankness gives the film a beguiling measure of dreamy, fabulistic wonder, one that entrances even as Roth's script regularly missteps.
22344	6	a	Director Jennifer Yuh Nelson's live-action debut contains all the hallmarks of the kind of film that could have done brisk business five years ago, but now seems doomed to join other one-offs.
22345	4	a	...watchable enough
22346	0	a	George A. Romero's Land of the Dead reveals that Romero remains the master of a genre he reinvented.
22347	6	a	[The Light Between Oceans,] although filled with pretty visuals and is skilfully anchored by a couple of committed performances, proves to be a little too gloomy to bear.
22348	5	a	Paul Weitz's film is a seriously unfunny comedy about that intersection where politics meets entertainment.
22349	3	a	Whatever you call this one-of-a-kind bonbon spiked with wit and malice, it's classic oo-la-la.
22350	0	a	This is uniquely a Paul Thomas Anderson picture, another expression of his formidable artistry and singular vision.
22351	3	a	Marsh ... masterfully spins a harrowing tale of human arrogance that eventually gives way to cruelty bordering on the pathological.
22352	5	a	When The Expendables revs up and becomes the loud, explosive machismo parade that it's meant to be, it works. But when it doesn't, it's rather abysmal.
22353	8	a	Eastwood seems to be reaching for some level of realism, but when every single interaction feels like half-coded AI tried to recreate bro talk, it's clear that a mistake has been made.
22354	5	a	A very sad story with great potential, but what's pulsating through its veins is a double-assed Twilight Zone that somehow manages to tell it from the wrong point of view.
22355	5	a	A lot of references beat you over the head, but I think that's the point, because the Internet beats you over the head...the end didn't blow me away, though.
22356	5	a	As a character, Catherine Weldon suffers the same fate as Sitting Bull, having been reduced to a signifier of the filmmakers' retroactive political correctness.
22357	3	a	It's pure entertainment, and gives Spielberg an easel to prop his sentimental painting on, and all the colors on his palette to do so.
22358	4	a	Men may be from Mars, and women from Venus, but Hitch hails from the planet GetMeSome.
22359	3	a	A beautiful little gem of a movie.
22360	2	a	"The Dressmaker"" wraps a pig pen of a town and its porky inhabitants in silk. It tackles the feeling of being cursed by your confines and the toxicity of small town gossip mongering; with beauty, death, romance and hilarity. "
22361	3	a	The world needs more of these stories, and there are a lot of them out there waiting to be told.
22362	3	a	Original adventures such as The Incredibles are the ones that will have families watching them over and over and over again, over the years.
22363	2	a	The film is so random that it can't help but get the audience laughing.
22364	2	a	Exciting and engrossing...doesn't attempt anything innovative, but it succeeds by doing the tried and true very effectively.
22365	6	a	This might be worth viewing if the film's characters came to life or its abundant philosophical and moral observations went more than pockmarked-skin deep.
22366	6	a	Barnyard doesn't know if it wants to be another tiresomely 'hip' piece of post-Shrek postmodernism or a comfortably traditional kids' movie that delivers family values without the self-conscious smirk.
22367	2	a	It's a wonder to know that each frame of this film was handmade, not orchestrated by a computer.
22368	0	a	There's nothing extraordinary about No Country for Old Men -- except, of course, the spectacle of two great directors in total command of their craft.
22369	7	a	Hal Holbrook will have been robbed if doesn't get nominated for every award available.
22370	3	a	A VIP tour of a secret, horribly fashionable world that one wouldn't want to linger in yet can't help but find fascinating.
22371	1	a	Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets works the kind of magic that Hollywood rarely displays: It's a sequel that's better than the original.
22372	1	a	A warm, funny, exciting film for which I feel more affection the more I think about it.
22373	1	a	This smart, metaphor-loving drama puts its heart up on the silver screen.
22374	3	a	Pfeiffer is superb in a delightful farce
22375	4	a	cannot be defended intellectually, yet, the film's very simplicity and directness gives it a kind of folkloric power, albeit power that works only if you give yourself over to it
22376	0	a	Benedict Cumberbatch gives a performance sure to be remembered come Oscar nomination time
22377	2	a	If you've only seen the more recent films and find them somewhat wanting, you owe it to yourself to check out the original to see how fresh and original these blockbuster films once felt. 
22378	5	a	If you think sweltering UV rays, deadly sandstorms and dwindling water sources are bad, you haven't had to contend with Giovanni Ribisi's heinous new bleach blond hair
22379	7	a	Dramatically and comically impotent.
22380	3	a	An intense psychological thriller, slow-boiling and unsettling.
22381	9	a	America's Sweethearts feels especially stupid for not offering Azaria's casting as some sort of auto-critique.

22383	4	a	Not Easily Broken leavens the soap opera with a big heart and lots of belly laughs.
22384	6	a	Were it not for the A-list cast, You, Me and Dupree is an effort one might expect to move directly to video store shelves, bypassing multiplexes altogether.
22385	5	a	Middling circus backstage drama.
22386	4	a	Incredibly average...wait for cable.
22387	3	a	Exactly what its title implies: lusty, boisterous and utterly charming.
22388	0	a	A thoughtful, moving film that's a pure delight from beginning to end.
22389	0	a	The dream team of Brad Bird and John Lasseter looks poised to defend family entertainment against mediocrity through what we can only hope will be a long-running franchise.
22390	9	a	Admittedly, no part of the year is immune to bad romantic comedies. But what distinguishes The Wedding Date, what qualifies it so impeccably for turkey season, goes way beyond generic foulness.
22391	3	a	Homegrown is a lovable off-the-wall film that, probably, very few have seen or even heard about.
22392	1	a	A way to relate pivotal events to an audience who probably knows little about the Irish republic's creation.
22393	4	a	Just your basic Aliens rip-off with the name of a formerly popular video game franchise tacked on it.
22394	1	a	Aranoa's storytelling is full of fire and nuance, and his striking, heartbreaking, mutedly hopeful film exhibits the spirit of its Italian neo-realist predecessors.
22395	2	a	This is the most straightforward, understated, and powerful big-screen representation of the gospel in recent movie history. And for that, Amistad should be recommended to everyone.
22396	4	a	All these good actors and all Crystal's sass and witty candor can't bring back the heyday of Billy Wilder and Preston Sturges. Or even, most of the time, their off-days.
22397	4	a	Does cinema get any better than this?
22398	6	a	Hoffman and Streisand give energetic, game performances, but the movie provides them with dispiritingly little material.
22399	6	a	A square peg pounded into a round hole -- or, more exactly, a medieval European story that has been unsuccessfully updated to the period of the American Civil War.
22400	9	a	The battle for the modern audience is to stay awake.
22401	3	a	Schmidt makes us flinch the old-fashioned way -- by giving us a box seat to the unspeakable.
22402	6	a	The second feature by the openly gay Canadian director interweaves in a rather schematic mode but with elegant style the stories of five troubled characters, each standing for one of the senses.
22403	3	a	The material is punctuated by a series of genuinely funny set-ups made all the more lively by some serious comic talent.
22404	4	a	Secret Things is definitely erotic and will appeal to prurient interests with its soft core pornography. But there is also the tale of ambition...
22405	3	a	The best darn movie of the seventies you've never seen.
22406	3	a	It's always supremely watchable, but rarely, if ever, commits itself to genuine jeopardy or suspense.
22407	9	a	Expect the same-old, lame-old slasher nonsense, just with different scenery.
22408	2	a	Paranoid Park becomes a portrait of the skate punk as repressed personality. The movie doesn't really go anywhere as a story, it simply unfolds.
22409	0	a	The changes are minor, but the overall effect is a much cleaner, more logical, and more organically flowing movie.
22410	4	a	Following the mystery injects some welcome momentum into what's otherwise the standard laundry list of end-of-school projects, and Green does have a way with the mildly pathetic drama of geeky youth.
22411	9	a	Logan Lucky is as charming and welcome as toenail fungus.
22412	2	a	Successfully making the stretch from her hip, glam TV image, Ms. Aniston embodies the emotionally exhausted cosmetics clerk who is weighted down by dullness, drudgery and desperation.
22413	0	a	Robert Altman manages to make the separate units into a seamless whole, aided by an impressive ensemble cast.
22414	4	a	It has the sad, goofy charm of a silent comedy with Buster Keaton, a Jarmusch favorite, with passive-aggressive hits and flashes of barely contained antagonism.
22415	3	a	While the western boastfulness may get on your nerves, Owen Wilson and Jackie Chan make the adventure a barrel of fun.
22416	9	a	All of the characters behave like idiots at every turn, even when the facts are staring them in the face.
22417	5	a	Miller's commitment to the role makes a mockery of the movie's conservative and predictable riches-to-rags story arc and the conventionality of its 'edgy' visual strategy.
22418	3	a	Superior thriller with one dynamite shock scene.
22419	2	a	Besides featuring people we can actually identify with, the film itself is actually pretty terrifying
22420	4	a	Average made Hammer horror pic about Dracula's resurrection.
22421	4	a	Just dub this one Where the Mild Things Are.
22422	3	a	A complex balancing act with a perfectly executed payoff that might not have had the same impact without Robinson's heartwarming breakout performance.
22423	3	a	For the most part, Garcia offers a sober, clear-eyed picture that's populated with prickly personalities and unenviable situations, and he and his actors are brave enough not to flinch even during the most challenging interludes.
22424	0	a	Contains so many layers that you'll want to see it more than once. It's one for the memory books.
22425	1	a	Precisely observant and completely funny.
22426	3	a	Although very much like the first movie based on J.K. Rowling's phenomenal fantasy best sellers, this second go-round possesses a quite pleasing, headlong thrust and a likably delinquent attitude.
22427	3	a	Resurrection is clearly pitched to fans who want a warts-and-some, officially sanctioned memento of their fallen hero.
22428	7	a	offers nothing of value
22429	0	a	"With the holiday season officially underway, ""Bolt"" is the perfect present for the whole family."
22430	9	a	Instead of making dreamz come true, it will only give you nightmarez.
22431	4	a	Hitch is light and funny for audiences in an undemanding mood.
22432	6	a	Noisy, scattershot Martin Lawrence comedy has a promising setup, and then simply stops trying.
22433	3	a	The film is an actors' showcase that Bening makes the most of.
22434	2	a	Sometimes you score points just for doing something different.
22435	3	a	Not since Jeff Goldblum succumbed to a purely sci-fi disease in 'The Fly' has watching a great actor gradually lose it being so gutting. 
22436	3	a	Philip Seymour Hoffman is excellent in this simmering espionage thriller.
22437	5	a	Isn't all that bad...but it lacks magic, and except as a harmless diversion for the youngsters on a rainy afternoon, you can safely hold off until it shows up on DVD.
22438	2	a	Tizita Hagere as Hirut Assefa provides the film with its stark emotional center while the unassuming cinematography emphasizes the feeling that the audience aren't just bystanders, but witnesses.
22439	7	a	A stupid, badly paced horror-comedy that's not funny, scary or suspenseful. A dog.
22440	5	a	Jane Austen did not live the life of Elizabeth Bennett, but even if she had, there was no reason to be this bland in presenting it.
22441	4	a	A fairly mediocre film, not nearly as funny as it should be, nor as heartfelt.
22442	4	a	Comic fairy tale romp has drinking, sexual situations.
22443	3	a	Like the poem from which it takes its title, it suffers not from any obvious technical flaws but from a failure of tone and perspective. It's a sermon, not a story.
22444	3	a	Let the trumpets blare for artistic freedom of expression that is perfectly reflected in this uplifting and moving biopic.
22445	5	a	Poor Joe Pantoliano, Kid Rock, and Joanna Cassidy get mixed up in the flatulence.
22446	1	a	Assembled with an intense amount of care and love so that every cut, every sound, every movement, builds to a euphonious whole.
22447	6	a	Whatever else is true of the movie, the cast is having fun, and Anna Kendrick gives phenomenal reaction shots.
22448	3	a	The Edge Of Seventeen boasts an emotional journey filled with wit, humor and heart, resting easy on the back of Hailee Steinfeld's dynamite performance.
22449	3	a	Philomena is a marvelous little movie, a heartwarming drama with plenty of comedic pathos that features Judi Dench, an incredibly bright, quickwitted woman, playing a simple Irish woman who doesn't get the jokes of her traveling companion.
22450	3	a	The hype around the film Monster is justified by the performance of Charlize Theron.
22451	0	a	Team America: World Police is one of the ballsiest films to hit American cinema screens this year.
22452	3	a	Brody pulls the juggling act off -- bringing to mind some riveting cinematic misfits before him, from Brando to McQueen to Pacino.
22453	4	a	It's quite the fun group to be stranded with -- unless you happen to be male, rich and in the way.
22454	3	a	Overrated, but with enough great moments to be a must-see
22455	3	a	My Big Fat Greek Wedding is a very slim movie that succeeds on its own modest terms without pretense or apology. No wonder it's easy to like.
22456	3	a	You'll 'Love, Simon.'
22457	6	a	The strain of sadism that's crept into mainstream American movies eventually overtakes and undercuts Hancock, which should embarrass the filmmakers, who pay lip service here to gooey idealism.
22458	4	a	An enjoyable, stirring sports movie.
22459	3	a	A compelling true story of perseverance and persecution, The Imitation Game has a lot of information it must convey to its audience. Time is of the essence. And time was always running out for Alan Turing.
22460	3	a	Really brilliant in the way it takes the viewer inside Bateman's world.
22461	3	a	A bittersweet road movie about the joy and sadness of ageing directed by the great Alexander Payne.
22462	4	a	Instead of being the next great John Woo masterpiece, it is yet another in the growing roster of action flicks that merely seem to reek of his influence.
22463	4	a	"If you can manage all that, and the chemistry between the leads will conspire to help you, then you might find ""The Wedding Date'' an amusing take on the strange ways of modern matchmaking, served up with a side dish of self-help for the single gal."
22464	4	a	The film is like a bunch of music videos strung together with a romance angle. And as mentioned earlier, you don't go for this movie for scintillating dialogue, but to see them move it like experts on the dance floor.
22465	2	a	The scenes of brute survival - hunting for food, improvising shelter, making wind-and-snow masks out of sheets of birch bark - are vivid. The men are not.
22466	7	a	By nudging the picture into primary colors, Astro Boy loses a shot at an intriguing personality. A little sustained darkness never hurt anyone.
22467	5	a	The predictably fine acting can't save the movie from the insipid writing, which is centered on the less-than-illuminating insight that some people really love their dogs. 
22468	9	a	... the only possible happy ending involves your escape from the theater with a few precious brain cells intact.
22469	6	a	Memories aren't made of this.
22470	3	a	Big, sweeping and gorgeous to look at. Scarcely a minute of it is dull.
22471	5	a	Mediocre erotic thriller trying to capture Basic Instinct success. Tries too hard, not really sexy, and certainly not mysterious.
22472	4	a	Where Shaun Of The Dead was inspired, this is comfortingly repetitive. But hey, isn't that the main attraction of any pub? 
22473	5	a	This ridiculous story will have you moaning.
22474	3	a	Though not one of Almodovar's strongest works, his noir medical thriller is creepy, bizarre, and stunningly elegant to merit our attention, not to mention that Antonio Banderas is assigned his best role in decades.
22475	2	a	Lawrence, in her most high-low, sad-comic turn yet, is remarkable.
22476	3	a	An unabashedly schmaltzy and thoroughly enjoyable true story.
22477	5	a	The director's previous films...are all, in some way, about cinema - but this need is especially acute in Broken Embraces, which eats its own tail.
22478	9	a	The script is so reliant on wish-fulfillment it forgets to add those important little touches: you know, wit, sincerity, characterisation, that kind of thing... A very cheap shot - and hardly anyone calls him 'Chuck'.
22479	3	a	takes no chances, but what it lacks in originality it makes up for by being so completely enraptured by the music that it takes the audience along with it
22480	5	a	"For all its talk about bringing life back to animals and humans, ""The Lazarus Effect"" simply doesn't have any to spare for itself."
22481	4	a	The Imitation Game puts Alan Turing's life on a conveyer belt. So we understand him less as a human. Other than his connection to his machine.
22482	3	a	The Passion doesn't suffer from the airless, pious airs that drag down most biblical dramas: It has a muscular, pounding energy and lyrical, almost gothic beauty.
22483	3	a	Midnight in Paris contains sequences happier than can be described.
22484	3	a	Two fine performances, a subject close to all our hearts and a screenplay that manages to be both brilliantly witty and almost unbearably poignant add up to the best family comedy-drama since Little Miss Sunshine.
22485	9	a	Most of the characters are one-dimensional stereotypes ... and the climax is a championship bout that's both utterly predictable and out of key with the story as a whole.
22486	2	a	Wildly imaginative and funny.
22487	1	a	This director plies a sweetly humanistic art in potentially ghoulish circumstances. He achieves a minimalism that's equally touching and rib-tickling.
22488	5	a	What a boring place Mooseport turns out to be.
22489	2	a	Truly extraordinary performances, the familiar yet rarely predictable script and the fertile subtext that looks at sexuality and desire through feminist question marks, makes 'Rambling Rose' one of the year's most touching and absorbing movie experiences.
22490	2	a	Informative and interesting reflections on his life by the man himself.
22491	6	a	Like virtually every sequel to a hit comedy, it recycles and essentially beats to death everything that got a laugh in the original film.
22492	2	a	One of the most popular Mickey Rooney-Judy Garland teamings of lets put on a show, directed by Busby Berkeley
22493	3	a	Bolt is packed with action sequences, but it finds room for humor and heart, too.
22494	6	a	The writing is funny during individual moments, but the cumulative result is a bit depressing, with a surprising amount of negativity. If anything, the pervasive doomed feeling of junior high is too accurate. Who wants to pay money to relive that?
22495	5	a	Eat Pray Love only superficially advocates independence and growth while serving up a steaming pile of pseudo-spiritual hyperbole. 
22496	5	a	The best film I've ever seen with a full grown man masquerading as a baby...hmmm.
22497	1	a	It is more than just a beautiful postcard - it's a film that has a story that will stay with you long after you've left the theater.
22498	4	a	There aren't enough adrenalin moments to supercharge a film that gets bogged down in exposition.
22499	0	a	The delightful Enchanted gives Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs a sweetly subversive spin.
22500	3	a	It's about as close to French farce as romantic comedies get, and the closer the better.
22501	3	a	The Road Warrior with plummier accents, Reign of Fire is fun because the dragons are fun.
22502	2	a	A deliciously pulpy thriller ... equal parts comedy and suspense, and the mix is nice.
22503	6	a	More like a skit that doesn't know when to pack it in.
22504	3	a	Good horror movies keep you up at night. And I'm really tired today.
22505	0	a	Three Billboards not only aspires towards greatness, but confronts it, screams at it, and when it has everyone's attention, revels in it. It's a profane and profound masterpiece that will evolve into a time capsule of sorts, when things get better.
22506	3	a	Tanovic gives us a mature, thoughtful story with sympathetic characters and a strong statement against war.
22507	5	a	It's not a bad idea, but just as you think you're watching a biting consumer satire, the plot instead descends into melodrama and soap operatics.
22508	3	a	Cute and touching, and more than a little romantic. It's the kind of movie that will find its audience, and its audience will adore it.
22509	5	a	A mongrel of a movie--scruffy, obvious and slightly disreputable...the best one can say of it is that it could have been worse.
22510	3	a	...a talky and sometimes witty romantic comedy that, at least for a while, serves as a bracing antidote to all those irritating, stroller-pushing Sacred Baby couples who seem to be everywhere, even in upscale restaurants, these days. 
22511	5	a	As it abruptly crosscuts among the five friends, it fails to lend the characters' individual stories enough dramatic resonance to make us care about them.
22512	4	a	It's built on excesses and implausibilities and no matter how busy it gets, these weaknesses remain painfully obvious.
22513	3	a	The slight plot is laced with generous dollops of vintage Irving Berlin songs, several of them staged with dazzling ingenuity.
22514	3	a	A joyous ode to a lost era of music making that will delight music buffs and those who appreciate a well-done documentary.
22515	1	a	At last, a movie about teens on the cusp of adulthood that has heart, wit and soul.
22516	1	a	Nebraska unfolds from a point of simplicity into a deep thread that sews together the best and worst of human nature.
22517	4	a	All that matters is that the loose ends of this sweet, kids-outsmart-the-adults fable are ultimately tied together nicely in a fashion certain to satisfy the average five year-old by the time the closing credits roll.
22518	6	a	Jennifer Hudson sings like an angel but the movie is not up to that level storywise.
22519	9	a	A mild disaster.
22520	2	a	Proves that John Holmes wasn't all about dingus; his other interests included drugs and sliminess.
22521	1	a	The combination of strong writing and note-perfect performances makes Mother and Child one of those unforgettable films that should be amongst the year's best. 
22522	9	a	One constant is its lovely cinematography. Another is its utter insignificance.
22523	4	a	As far as legal procedurals and family dramas go, Black or White is a minor success.
22524	1	a	The plot is rather weak, but the tone is dark and haunting and the visuals stunning, not to mention Brad Pitt's stunning portrait of paranoia and fear
22525	2	a	Like its title character, the movie doesn't strive for depth. But it's stylish and, yes, also charming.
22526	9	a	There's little to recommend Snow Dogs, unless one considers cliched dialogue and perverse escapism a source of high hilarity.
22527	5	a	An action-comedy that no one should be surprised sucks.
22528	3	a	An entertaining spy thriller thankfully free of the campy, tongue-in-cheek excesses of the recent James Bond films.
22529	1	a	The most fascinating element of the film is its formal linking of its multiple, no-nonsense protagonists. [Blu-Ray review]
22530	6	a	The movie never takes its material far enough, it's never daring, it's never edgy, it's never satiric. It's just, well, it's just TV.
22531	9	a	I found it agonisingly banal, twee and self-important - a dreadful sell-out to Hollywood at its schmaltziest by a director I have previously admired.
22532	1	a	Fight Club is a fast paced rush of adrenaline boasting amazing performances from both Pitt and Norton.
22533	1	a	The movie is madly, wonderfully at odds with itself.
22534	3	a	"As ridiculous as ""Sausage Party"" sounds, it actually manages to humanize the items we so violently slice, dice and devour. You may never look at a potato or bag of baby carrots the same way again."
22535	5	a	There's still time, but for now, Fogler gets my vote for the worst performance of the year.
22536	4	a	Helen Mirren, playing opposite Anthony Hopkins, does the movie's best acting work as Hitchcock's right-hand woman. 
22537	5	a	This isn't a terrible movie; it certainly isn't the train wreck bomb of a release I've heard it described as. It just isn't anything great or especially engaging worth recommending.
22538	5	a	If you've seen the trailer, you've seen the better version.
22539	6	a	It presents little that wasn't already done better in Myth of the American Sleepover, an equally evocative tale of longing that was far more successful at matching teen tropes with atmospheric naturalism.
22540	3	a	A film that's funny and entertaining for kids and adults and does not involve moronic warring neighbors.
22541	6	a	I figure Brody chose his own hip-jutting, fashion-runway postures, little realizing at the time that he was about to punch a big-time ticket out of this indie palookaville.
22542	3	a	This movie is smarter and better acted and just plain funnier than most of its predecessors in the my-first-time genre, no matter which sex is losing what.
22543	5	a	Soulless Hollywood product doesn't provide a better textbook example than this Tom Hanks/Julia Roberts vehicle.
22544	4	a	It's pretty much a bust.
22545	4	a	Martin could have made a much more compelling film by focusing on just a few characters instead of trying to deconstruct an entire record label.
22546	4	a	The more outrageous it becomes the more impossible the film is to criticize.
22547	6	a	As mindlessly engaging as its predecessor...
22548	7	a	The contempt for the audience displayed in Wild Wild West is breathtaking.
22549	5	a	I am still a big Mark Wahlberg fan but his choice of roles is beginning to try my patience
22550	3	a	It's a movie that feels rich in possibility, like the time of life it depicts, and creates a sunniness that lingers long after the credits roll.
22551	1	a	Bouncing back and forth between belief and incredulity, the film weaves an engaging story about love, time travel and the importance of looking beyond the obvious.
22552	3	a	A bold and rousing historical epic.
22553	4	a	The star of Paris Can Wait is Diane Lane, with supporting performances by Alec Baldwin, food, wine, Provence, and chocolate.
22554	7	a	Ultimately, The Light Between Oceans is a hokey period romance masquerading as a morality tale.
22555	3	a	Taylor deserves much of the credit for capturing the magic of Brown as entertainer, but just as much credit must go to Boseman, who not only re-creates Brown's explosive stage moves, but dominates every other scene he's in.
22556	4	a	It plays like a movie dreamed up by people in a studio marketing department who'd decided to bare their souls.
22557	5	a	Something of a disappointment, thanks to some dreary photography and a boring, unimaginative script that completely wastes a talented supporting cast.
22558	5	a	Diehard boxing fans will likely be disappointed by the film's lackluster fight scenes, calling them boring and lifeless.
22559	3	a	A movie that tears into its characters' nostalgia for the past - and our own - with darkly comic gusto.
22560	5	a	It's conventional, nonsensical, pandering and crammed with potty humor. If there was ever any charm to this franchise, it's long gone by now.
22561	1	a	Painful, horrifying and oppressively tragic, this film should not be missed.
22562	9	a	WITH all the talent, time and effort that has gone into making a movie like this, I hate reducing it to one word. But here goes. Revolutionary Road is ... AWFUL.
22563	3	a	Some things you probably won't care about in Snakes on a Plane: character development, the musical score, harsh lighting that makes everyone look like they're wearing wrinkle-enlarging cream. Here's what you will care about: It's a lot of fun.
22564	4	a	I'm really on the fence with this one, but I cannot give it a solid recommendation based solely on the fact that it loses its momentum far too often than it should.
22565	5	a	The whole mob yap away in self-absorbed therapy-speak for almost the entire two-hour running time, meaning anyone who lives outside the Beverly Hills nut-bubble - ie almost everyone - is going to be instinctively reaching for the fast-forward button.
22566	6	a	The Tourist is best considered an expensive travel ad for Venice rather than the sexy, action-packed, sassy thriller we were all hoping for.
22567	7	a	It's a movie experiment that fails badly...
22568	6	a	Strong in intent but wobbles under the lights.
22569	4	a	There is a solid story here, but it's weakened by heavy-handed dialogue, strained symbolism and subplots that don't got anywhere.
22570	8	a	Heartfelt thanks must go out ... to actor Jeffrey Combs, whose brief, amusing appearance is the only reason this loser doesn't get a zero-star rating.
22571	9	a	Vincent Gallo has proved himself a good actor in many films -- in Arizona Dream, The Funeral, and several Claire Denis movies. But the first feature in which he functions as director, cowriter, composer, and star is a pathological curiosity.
22572	4	a	Secondhand Lions is a movie you want to believe in -- original ideas, acclaimed actors -- but McCanlies uses too many broad strokes when subtlety and finesse would have had greater impact.
22573	4	a	While Still Alice occasionally overstates, relies on its melancholy soundtrack or those home movie-style flashbacks, it can also be delicate, even brilliant.
22574	5	a	Is there anything in movies less convincing than a high-school ne'er-do-wells get-down-and-study montage?
22575	6	a	dyskoleyetai na kratisei ypo elegho toys melodramatismoys tis, kai sto deytero miso tis se krataei men me sfigmena ta heria ap' tin agonia, katorthoma, omos, poy den eimai sigoyros oti einai kai toso dyskolo, otan s' ehei paei os ekei me ta sagonia tentom
22576	8	a	Flight of the Phoenix is a rare breed. It joins the small group of films in which the audience may actually wish that the characters do not achieve their goal: to live.
22577	3	a	The good news is that the one-liners are much funnier than the first time, mainly thanks to the increased input of screenwriter Paul Rudnick.
22578	3	a	Catapults you from the cinema in a state of breathless disbelief.
22579	3	a	A lovely place to visit but not particularly absorbing as a narrative, even though Armie Hammer gives an impressive performance.
22580	4	a	These are no Thunderbirds string-dolls with few movable parts and no facial expressions. They're high-tech - and anatomically correct.
22581	3	a	Cage, Rockwell and Lohman play us almost as well as they do their cinematic victims
22582	1	a	It's about time someone gave Bill Murray a leading juicy role the talented actor could sink his teeth into.
22583	5	a	"Kasbah"" plays like a comedy penned by Donald Rumsfeld."
22584	1	a	Slavin's debut is a tremendous testament to the continuing power of Arthur Miller's work.
22585	4	a	Wilfully silly and heart-warming, this film is very easy viewing.
22586	7	a	Ewan McGregor shows no hint of inspiration behind the camera.
22587	3	a	[VIDEO] David Fincher can do a great re-make. Now, let's hope he never does one again. 
22588	3	a	Easier to admire than to love, David Cronenberg's Cosmopolis is an amplified, feverish vision of the one percent as scarcely human.
22589	3	a	Those unbitten by the curse of the undead won't have quite as much to chew on, but the film is clever and entertaining enough to keep most anyone amused.
22590	5	a	...jerky, with a flat, uneven pace...
22591	5	a	Underwhelming.
22592	3	a	A major reason Nolan has become one of the premier filmmakers in the industry is because he never casts an actor that isn't completely deserving of the role.
22593	2	a	Sorrentino's direction is as crisp as it has ever been, telling one of his more relatable tales.
22594	4	a	There's a lot of action and nifty special effects in a climactic battle scene. But the movie pays only fleeting attention to other matters, including character development.
22595	5	a	A simple-minded cartoon that aims for low-brow laughs rather than going for the jugular.
22596	1	a	"MacFarlane is just passable as a leading man, but as a director and co-writer with two others he has a wider comic imagination than ""Blazing Saddles."" For every so-so gag there are three genius ones."
22597	4	a	Would we still be talking about Monster, though, without Theron's remarkable transition? Probably not.
22598	4	a	This particular take on a major studio teen comedy is long overdue, but director Greg Berlanti seems intent on keeping his movie attuned to mainstream sensibilities. 
22599	3	a	If you're down for a silly hack-and-slash flick, you can do no wrong with Jason X.
22600	3	a	"The Bourne Identity"" is a well-written action spy film that stays true to its espionage thriller genre while inflicting flinch-inducing moments of pure cinematic action."
22601	6	a	Once the central plot is revealed, it's all downhill.
22602	3	a	A frivolous fable and a fabulous frivol, a lighthearted romp and a dark night of the existential soul-Slacker meets Metropolis.
22603	3	a	Headhunters director Morten Tyldum and Benedict Cumberbatch, at the top of his game, forge the definitive account of Turing's life.
22604	9	a	The film's racial/class issues are less developed than Gibson's beefy, inked-up arms and its unintentional humor as consistent as its pounding soundtrack beats.
22605	5	a	Short, simple and inoffensive, it's well suited to family viewing, albeit on the gogglebox one Sunday teatime rather than the big screen.
22606	2	a	Refreshingly, it's actually about action, albeit arbitrary action, and how it defines us and keeps us alive.
22607	3	a	Once again, Shults demonstrates his extreme resourcefulness as a filmmaker, wringing blood-curdling tension out of controlled camera movements, creative practical lighting, and a red door. 
22608	0	a	Russell's best and most daring work to date.
22609	1	a	An exercise in sheer joy. This is pure entertainment at its best, and one of the best pictures of the year.
22610	6	a	There are only so many life or death deadlines we can be expected to stomach in one trip to Mars as the impossible repeatedly becomes the inevitable in these all or nothing scenarios.
22611	6	a	When the overripe dialogue and stodgy pace prove tiresome, there is always a great deal of artistic detail upon which the eyes can feast.
22612	4	a	The syrupy score just adds to the cheesiness of what is a classy disease-of-the-week weepie.
22613	4	a	An innocuous introduction to diversity for the preschool set, Pooh's Heffalump Movie features some charming songs by Carly Simon and is warmly animated so as to evoke nostalgia in parents.
22614	2	a	A thrilling political war movie that sees Tom Cruise and a stellar British cast of high-ranking German officers plot to assassinate Hitler and end the war before the Germany they love is destroyed.
22615	5	a	The film is a tonally uneven, genre-shifting hurricane of a thing, wildly careering off the rails and smashing into everything in its view.
22616	10	a	Get these guys a poem, song, or talk show appearance. Putting them in the movies is a bad idea, with Eastwood turning attempted inspirational authenticity into a tortuous, uncomfortably silly viewing experience.
22617	5	a	Some viewers have found this film adorable but its quirky cuteness was lost on me.
22618	5	a	Filled with fancy, if frenetic footwork but weighed down by all-too-familiar plot/characters/dialogue.
22619	2	a	A very funny, blatantly satirical and insolently honest look into the life of the former it boy.
22620	4	a	Director Clint Eastwood turns a remarkable true story into an unremarkable film with Invictus
22621	10	a	This is a gruesome film, even by modern standards. It is also utterly devoid of a point, or interesting ideas.
22622	7	a	Port Perry, Ontario, becomes Sitcom City, where the characters actually hesitate after each joke to allow the audience to laugh.
22623	4	a	These movies are sheer silliness, improbable roadway mayhem interspersed with obligatory fistfights and gunplay, all coated with a noxious layer of adolescent macho posturing.
22624	3	a	The older you are, the more sensitive and receptive to the script's somber material you will likely be.
22625	1	a	Insightful, thoroughly well-written, amazingly acted, deservedly touching and downright hilarious, The Edge of Seventeen needs to be seen if we want to get more movies of this quality within the well trodden genre.
22626	4	a	Menashe has a tenderness to it that is hard to decry, and because it's shorter than your average film, it doesn't have the time to go off the rails and become something it's not.
22627	5	a	Extremely dull, badly written comedy-drama that never gets off the ground, despite likeable performances from Rudd, Witherspoon and a perfectly cast Wilson.
22628	1	a	Jennifer Westfeldt's observant writing keeps things grounded and the strong performances root the movie in truthful emotions
22629	3	a	This is a movie... that allows its kids to be kids, that shows them in the insular world of imagination and dreaming that children create entirely apart from adult domains and values.
22630	2	a	Good buddy-buddy chemistry between Chou and Rogan, along with some inspired carnage in the last half hour make THE GREEN HORNET a rare treat in a traditionally slow month.
22631	8	a	The South China Sea's answer to the Bermuda Triangle, but off-the-shelf acting and a hackneyed plot won't keep this oversized barge afloat.
22632	3	a	Michael Mann has come a long way since his days supervising Miami Vice on TV, and it's fascinating to watch a filmmaker of such extraordinary ability working a slice of pure cheesecake like this.
22633	0	a	American Hustle reminds me of a great Scorsese movie. 
22634	4	a	If Russell is erratic with plot and the slightest bit smug in attitude, he makes up for these flaws by drawing fun, inspired performances from his ace cast.
22635	7	a	Low indeed have Marvel's fortunes sunk when this is the best they can send against their archrival's superior Batman Begins.
22636	2	a	Nightmare is delightfully unique, just not a dream come true.
22637	4	a	Mature relationship dramedy heartfelt, but also cliched.
22638	2	a	You expect it to be crude, rude, profane and hilariously vulgar - and it doesn't disappoint.
22639	3	a	"A gripping and knowing look at the modern ""mean streets."
22640	6	a	Hinges on a rather unbelievable characterization of fascist kindness.
22641	8	a	The picture is a veritable bouquet of ardent cliches and witless sentiments.
22642	6	a	It's the kind of film where you admire the craftsmanship and artistry while questioning the wisdom of the project itself.
22643	6	a	Unseating James Caan as the least convincing Stephen King stand-in ever, Johnny Depp is hopelessly miscast.
22644	4	a	A fine middlebrow addition to the end-of-year sweepstakes, as good as expected, as bad as feared, and gone without a ripple.
22645	4	a	It's on the easygoing level of Surf's Up, and a full tick up from, say, Over the Hedge or The Ant Bully. But given the Seinfeld pedigree it's something of a disappointment.
22646	9	a	How sincere is Sincere Seth MacFarlane? I know I'm a dope for even asking-associating a genuine emotion with such a sniggering clown is a sucker's bet-but I really do want to know. 
22647	4	a	Watchable, and on a certain level, it's quite enjoyable.
22648	3	a	I can tell you that as a virgin to the story, this version of Girl with the Dragon Tattoo completely drew me into Larsson's beautifully constructed, terrifying world.
22649	3	a	The film tapers off in its final reel, ending on a conventional note -- but not before it has done its best to capture its subject in all his manic and absurd glory.
22650	5	a	Not to put too fine a point on it, but this movie throws like a girl.
22651	3	a	A shamelessly uplifting motion picture that attains its feel-good status by forging a deep emotional connection between the undertrodden protagonist and the audience.
22652	5	a	A brainy intersection of science and faith, it's a movie that asks big questions. It's also, however, frustratingly short on any real answers.
22653	3	a	David Fincher's The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo is a tense thriller that unfolds with all the twists and turns one could hope to have.
22654	3	a	Donnie Darko is a bit like a teenager: brooding, complex, rebellious, and difficult to comprehend. 
22655	4	a	Dahl's takes a dive, a disappointing followup to his spicy 'Red Rock West' and 'The Last Seduction. 
22656	9	a	They should have stuck to the promise emblazoned on the original movie's poster: 'No sequel.'
22657	4	a	Heavy-handed at times and poorly plotted, but energetic and funny. A suitably undignified return to the screen for the notorious school and its out-of-control pupils.
22658	9	a	Although Wonderland isn't much of a movie, it is a parade of exceptional acting.
22659	6	a	Despite the utterly amazing animation and exciting action, this is nothing like its source material and is very disappointing in the end.
22660	6	a	This most human of tales is sadly lacking humanity.
22661	9	a	The lesson here is never to aim to make a great movie before locking in the framework for a good one.
22662	4	a	The film is extremely hit-and-miss.
22663	4	a	[Jackson] is, of course, born to shout things at teenagers on basketball courts and he delivers all the time-honoured usual speeches with his customary brilliance
22664	4	a	The end product won't win any Oscars, but the edges of this slapstick action film retain James's blitzkrieg sense of humor, making for a light comic adventure I'm positive kids will flip for.
22665	0	a	Luminous in its freedom from the sentimentality or the satire that so often obscure an artist's vision of normal living.
22666	3	a	His assembly of a beautiful montage of Parisian scenery that precedes the opening credits sets the unique tone Allen chases to perfection.
22667	3	a	As bland as vanilla pudding. But unless you're completely vanilla-phobic, the movie's unforced good feelings are easy to enjoy.
22668	1	a	The Grey Zone is powerful, mesmerizing and disturbing.
22669	6	a	A self-indulgent comedy catchall, one that's saddled with an irony for a title; that is, for a film about the value of identity, Identity Thief doesn't have a clue about what it wants to be.
22670	4	a	Figgis relies on Quaid's performance to convey the perilous dynamics of his character's threatened masculinity, and the performance produced by this trust is solid gold.
22671	4	a	"The A.A Milne-based ""Christopher Robin"" stars Ewan McGregor as the grown-up title character, but it's childhood friends Winnie-the-Pooh, Eeyore, Piglet and Tigger stealing the cinematic thunder."
22672	6	a	Typical, tiresome, forgettable crap.
22673	4	a	Thankfully, Linney and Byrne are so good, so absolutely mesmerizing, many of these flaws can be at least partially overlooked thanks to them.
22674	3	a	All summer blockbusters should be as loud and scary -- and deliver -- like this. 
22675	3	a	The film's greatest asset is how much it's not just another connect-the-dots, spy-on-the-run picture.
22676	5	a	...a periodically passable yet oppressively uneven piece of work.
22677	5	a	As far as good humor goes, Dickie Roberts is kid stuff.
22678	3	a	It's hard not to admire the film's confidence in making the story its own, and Ms. Linney, a mix of iron will and emotional fragility, delivers her usual complex performance.
22679	4	a	The pitch might not be perfect but might appeal to fans of the franchise.
22680	0	a	An immensely appealing teen comedy that speaks to us with immediacy and grace about adolescence.
22681	5	a	There are several problems with the romantic comedy You, Me and Dupree, not least that there is no filmmaking to speak of.
22682	3	a	Rescued from hagiography and cliche by tart writing and a spark-plug star performance from Don Cheadle.
22683	4	a	By any impartial system of judgment, it is at best a mediocre film, but within its genre, it's better than some.
22684	4	a	If there's one thing you can be sure of, modern remakes of older movies always have better crashes.
22685	1	a	Lost in Translation is a fortunate encounter between a young talent on the rise and an old pro still hitting his stride.
22686	6	a	The young cast is all game, and sidekicks Robert Capron and Grayson Russell are a real hoot. Slumber party viewings are inevitable.
22687	3	a	Taut, clever, and fronted with two excellent performances, this is a clever choice for Jackson's first step into mainstream filmmaking.
22688	3	a	I'm still not convinced that the world needed a remake of Alfie... but after watching the movie, I'm certain Jude Law needed it. 
22689	2	a	Maybe you should let the grandparents take the kids to this one.
22690	3	a	There's a pounding heartbeat throughout the film; every character has superbly-defined desires and pains.
22691	9	a	Owes more to the third or fourth sequel to Meatballs and other character-building summer-camp comedies than it does to Daddy Day Care, with neither director Fred Savage or the writers inclined to come up with a single original idea.
22692	3	a	Helping make these points is as strong a cast as Lee has yet worked with.
22693	3	a	It's a beguiling story and Bell and Bening are tremendous as the star-crossed lovers.
22694	2	a	...an upbeat crowd pleaser that should break Yi out of the L.A. underground comedy circuit.
22695	2	a	A rich, unsettling film that gives us insight into all sides and forces us to wrestle with conscience and our own brand of right and wrong. It polarizes us to make us united.
22696	9	a	If you're going to make a bad film, at least make it short.
22697	4	a	These were very bad people, but very good actors play them.
22698	2	a	Bullock and Grant are perfectly paired in Two Weeks Notice. The script allows the two actors to be at their comedic best, even though the film as a whole is amateurish in many ways.
22699	6	a	There's something distinctly sour-tasting in how long the film lingers on its characters doubling-down on their awkwardness.
22700	3	a	In Pirates, Depp stole the show. In Secret Window, he is the show.
22701	7	a	"Using the ""F"" word fifty million times is not brilliant script writing"
22702	9	a	Significantly worse than the rest of the series, this film is one of the worst bell-flops in recent cinema.
22703	3	a	It will keep you smiling and keep you guessing. It's far from the safe, formulaic comedies that usually emanate from the big studios in Hollywood.
22704	4	a	This comedy hits the target just enough to find box office gold in them thar hills.
22705	3	a	The Imitation Game is an extraordinarily riveting film with a superb score and a performance from Benedict Cumberbatch that is awkward, brilliant perfection and a welcome consideration for one of the most powerful on screen presences of the year. 
22706	9	a	This could, I suppose, be the grounds for a sharp dark comedy. But in Grant's hands, it comes out all wrong.
22707	6	a	Ang Lee's approach is too earnest in trying to make an emotionally resonant story without the rough edges the material demands.
22708	3	a	You could rant at me for hours all the reasons it sucks, and I'd probably agree with most of them -- but the point is, I had fun.
22709	3	a	Disney's Enchanted is the sweet, lighthearted antithesis to the more serious fare this holiday season, fueled by a thoroughly captivating performance from Amy Adams.
22710	3	a	There are layers upon layers here, all guaranteed to make you laugh and maybe even make you feel a feeling. 
22711	3	a	It starts strong, but bogs in a muddled slapstick finale.
22712	6	a	A jumble of ideas and stunning performances that never coalesce into a satisfying movie.
22713	3	a	Comforting and warm as a tummy-full of oatmeal.
22714	1	a	While there could be more that goes into a Gloria Grahame film, as a May-December Hollywood weepie, Film Stars Die in Liverpool earns its Kleenex.
22715	3	a	[Cranston] acts with his eyes, with such intelligence that the patchwork of lines on his face seem to get deeper by the scene.
22716	4	a	Despite its flaws, Jeanne Labrune's Special Treatment is surprisingly atmospheric at times.
22717	2	a	If Jurassic Park was Jaws with claws, War of the World is E.T. gone bad, a big, noisy, scary sci-fi with dazzling technology that overwhelms the simplistic story and personae
22718	2	a	The Artist is a technical exercise first, movie second-but the result is undeniably pleasant. Few will be safe from the movie's bombardment of silent but deadly charm.
22719	3	a	War is a blast.
22720	6	a	The movie is all over the map, trying whatever seems to work at the moment.
22721	4	a	the film comes off as an academic exercise instead of a living, breathing testament to the ideas it presents.
22722	4	a	Del Toro's creativity, the joy he finds in splicing together pieces of the movies and books and characters he loves, is hard to resist. This is a film that believes deeply in ghosts, and half of them are in its director's head.
22723	3	a	anadomei ohi mono tin eikona, tin aisthisi kai ti myrodia toy Far Oyest me ton paliomoditiko tropo grafis kai anaptyksis toy, alla kai ena panemorfo, stoiheiotiko, lito portraito tis amerikanikis ekdohis tis ennoias toy thryloy eikonografimenoy
22724	4	a	The Other Boleyn Girl is a fitting prequel to the Elizabeth movies: It's pretty, passionate, and full of historical poppycock.
22725	2	a	Cheadle convincingly layers his outrageousness with off-the-air pain and pathos.
22726	3	a	Derek Cianfrance, working from his own screenplay, has infused The Light Between Oceans with a lush, intensely cinematic sensibility that effectively heightens the picture's old-school feel...
22727	4	a	You have to do a little trash diving but it excels when deconstructing the Western genre
22728	4	a	A bit out of tune.
22729	3	a	The kind of instantly disposable but exceptionally agreeable trifle that's best enjoyed with one's significant other, preferably before or after an intimate dinner for two.
22730	5	a	Roth's not prepared in full, creating a feature that's tonally off-balance, making delight with the dark side a chore to experience. 
22731	2	a	Hoffman, bloated and flushed, does not look well in this film. But he is such a consummate actor that whatever infirmities he may have been fighting become a part of his performance.
22732	1	a	As much as Casino Royale felt like a game-changer six years ago, Skyfall moves the ball further down the field. It is both grander and grimmer. 
22733	3	a	Sweep aside the gross-outs and you've got the family values comedy of the year.
22734	7	a	Isabelle Huppert has a sly technique and endlessly fascinating face, but this initially intriguing drama abandons darker overtones for rather wan interpersonal revelations.
22735	6	a	Heavy on dreamy imagery and light on facts and insights.
22736	4	a	Forgive the distracting cameos by comics Mike Epps and Nick Cannon, and Roll Bounce is worth a spin.
22737	3	a	A slasher movie minus the slasher.
22738	0	a	An allegory for rape and the Chinese tradition of concubinage.
22739	1	a	Carool is an effective portrait of an era, but it's also a way of making a thinking about cinema. [Full Review in Spanish]
22740	3	a	Think of this scenario as a smart, witty, well-acted romance novel that has sprung to life on the big screen with some restraint and a decent amount of dignity.
22741	0	a	'I've seen things you people wouldn't believe,' declares one of the androids late in the going. And if you've seen this film, you can make the same claim.
22742	1	a	Cooper gives his most natural, affecting and compelling performance yet...Lawrence makes us forget her dewy youth just minutes into her brittle, biting turn as a woman whose unbalanced rage is even more cleverly concealed...
22743	6	a	Like its defector hero, Mao's Last Dancer is neither here nor there...determinedly dull, even in the flatly filmed ballet sequences.
22744	0	a	Extraordinary in its beautiful, lyrical simplicity...Coppola's seemingly effortless, flawlessly fluid command of the film's moods and unspoken emotions is cinematic bliss.
22745	4	a	True, the novelty factor of the original has disappeared. But if you're looking for a shamelessly puerile comedy, you won't find anything lewder or louder this summer.
22746	3	a	It's the most interesting spin on domestic strife since Michael Douglas and Kathleen Turner were hurling dishes at each other in The War of the Roses.
22747	5	a	Hanks and Roberts co-star in well-meaning but treacly drama.
22748	5	a	long and cumbersome
22749	1	a	When Mel Gibson passes on to that big screen in the sky, don't be surprised if he's best remembered for playing a flirtatious rooster.
22750	6	a	You can accuse Diesel of playing an immortal version of Dominic Cooper, his character from The Fast and the Furious films, and you would be exactly right. His character is dry and the line delivery flat.
22751	3	a	I had shelved a movie critic's usual reserve and just started identifying with Willie and Skip.
22752	4	a	The sheer contrived ridiculousness is part of the fun. But you really do have to know the game.
22753	0	a	The Coens squeeze us without mercy in a vise of tension and suspense, but only to force us to look into an abyss of our own making.
22754	0	a	Like the sad, bug-eyed Gollum, moviegoers may not have realized how much they missed movies like this onscreen in the past several years. 
22755	10	a	"Somebody should have said, ""Whoa, Rob, let's re-think this."" But apparently nobody did."
22756	8	a	Either a very silly Stephen King thriller or a brilliant parody of same.
22757	6	a	Short on emotion.
22758	7	a	It moves fast, pukes up its guts, then starts sprinting again. Those with a taste for such endurance tests can indulge all they want. I'll get off at the next stop.
22759	3	a	It is incredibly pleasant to spend a couple of hours with characters as unashamedly smart as this. It is rare these days to find English-speaking characters who revel in the pleasures of intellectual discussion, who celebrate each other's braininess.
22760	3	a	Croatian-born director-writer Goran Dukic instills Wristcutters with the absurdist humor you find in films from the Balkans.
22761	4	a	I can't say that it's great but I can't say that I didn't laugh either.
22762	4	a	"In the end, ""Snakes on a Plane"" isn't so much a movie --- and a good one, in parts --- as it is the concluding installment of a long-building new-media phenomenon."
22763	5	a	Frank Perry's lackadaisical direction hobbles the forward movement of the story and keeps it from being a funny as it could be.
22764	4	a	Not the laugh-a-minute riot FG fans are accustomed to, but [the film] is consistently funny and [Seth] MacFarlane works hard to relate everything back to the main story...solidly entertaining...also puts to rest any doubts that MacFarlane can hold a lead.
22765	5	a	"[VIDEO ESSAY] Crimson Peak"" isn't an awful movie; it just isn't a very good one either. Come back Guillermo del Toro. We need you."
22766	7	a	I was more afraid of what was in my popcorn's butter-flavoring than I was of what was up on the screen.
22767	6	a	Not the stuff strong thrillers are made of, but Panic Room screenwriter David Koepp knows how to ratchet up the tension and spring as many giddy jump cuts on the audience as they can stand.
22768	3	a	Ridley Scott may not have created the perfect epic, but he came awfully close.
22769	0	a	...the rare magic trick that still holds its power even after you've learned all of its secrets.
22770	4	a	Laughable plot pushes The Skulls to brink of absurdity.
22771	3	a	Whether you're more attuned to adorable animals or environmental issues, Arctic Tale is pretty cool.
22772	4	a	"The drama offers little new to the ""disease drama"" genre but the whole film is lifted thanks to Moore."
22773	9	a	The picture wastes barely a second heading straight into the toilet.
22774	5	a	"We Bought a Zoo"" is as phony as a Kardashian marriage."
22775	9	a	"Roger Ebert put it best, ""Doom is like some kid came over and is using your computer and won't let you play."
22776	5	a	The tone seems as uneven as the pacing.
22777	2	a	Rather than trying to beat Hollywood at its own game of high-tech gadgets and weaponry, director Colin Trevorrow and writer Derek Connolly achieve a sly mix of the insane and the mundane.
22778	1	a	Sergio Leone meets 'The Shakiest Gun in the West' in this odd movie about a chameleon who -- credit the filmmakers for their cleverness -- doesn't blend in.
22779	1	a	As short film devices go, this dynamic might not be the most original, but Tong generates real laughs and genuinely tearjerking moments from this work that draws on the uncanny sense of direction that some older people possess.
22780	4	a	At least in spurts, Little Man provides some big laughs.
22781	4	a	After all the hopes that I had for this film being the return to greatness for the franchise, I am sad to report that Bond has once again misfired.
22782	6	a	The camerawork is jerky and distracting, the dialogue is cliched and the story makes so little sense that the script seems to have been improvised by the actors as they went along.
22783	6	a	I've little doubt that Swicord and Marshall have produced an accurate account of the geisha lifestyle, but I'm not sure that it feels like a terribly authentic one.
22784	3	a	Don't listen to the haters -- this linguistically complex and eloquently dark film is much more clever than pretentious.
22785	6	a	It's a situation looking for comedy, which Klapisch and his young cast only occasionally deliver.
22786	4	a	The plotless nature of the movie eventually catches up to it, which leads to a film that isn't exactly compelling - though Theron's performance [is] always interesting.
22787	3	a	Ultimately, the movie is redeemed by a string of well-earned laughs and its trio of bright and engaging leads.
22788	5	a	Style over substance, I, Frankenstein establishes an interesting sandbox - one that, given a stronger story and more developed characters, might be worth revisiting.
22789	2	a	Any woman who wants to change her man will find out how.
22790	5	a	The cliched plot and unconvincing action sequences ... don't blend well with the comic scenes and make the film look painfully cheap.
22791	1	a	Penn has managed an impressive achievement that qualifies as a great American film. [Blu-ray]
22792	4	a	The Full Monty is feel-good comedy with none of the pejorative hints of innocuous blandness that term so often implies.
22793	6	a	There are a lot of things wrong with this movie, and no things that are right. It's just about as bad a movie as I've seen in all the years I've been reviewing films.
22794	4	a	Tommy Lee Jones is superb in the title role, but writer-director Ron Shelton unwisely chose to structure the film as a two-character piece, thus placing undue attention on the lackluster character of Cobb's biographer, Al Stump.
22795	5	a	There's simply not enough spark in even the more engaging segments to drive you, the audience, under its spell.
22796	3	a	Children of Invention's derives its beauty from its casually obsessed dwelling on the minutia of dreaming when you're down and out.
22797	1	a	Sensual and scary, the movie is so visually textured you feel as though you're brushing against the screen.
22798	9	a	This lump of telly melodrama is basically a bland, off-puttingly shouty sermon in film's clothing.
22799	3	a	Stands out as one of the year's best films.
22800	4	a	May not provide a challenging, electrifying night at the movies, but it's sturdily constructed from top to bottom, depicting a benevolent story of racial discord and nationwide unification in an agreeably comfy, Eastwoodian manner.
22801	4	a	Whitney Houston's alleged dramatic acting and dull, uninvolving storyline weighs down the virtues of the film.
22802	5	a	It just gets louder and more nonsensical as it progresses, with Fox shoe-horned into as many scenes as possible.
22803	2	a	While I admire filmmakers who navigate material like this without sentimentality, this film stands back just a bit too much and leaves us feeling like distant observers.
22804	9	a	This one's dead in the water.
22805	5	a	Naggingly inconsistent and oppressively dumb.
22806	2	a	Thomas Carter ... produces a film that sizzles on the court, but loses heat in the sub-plots and backstory.
22807	5	a	The characters are all representative of the period but they come off as one-dimensional, more symbols than individuals.
22808	2	a	What makes Secret Window both scary and amusing is Depp.
22809	6	a	Letters to Juliet offers little to viewers besides many trite truisms about the ways of the heart, some sumptuous views of the Tuscan countryside and a lovely performance by Redgrave.
22810	6	a	Far too many scenes seem painfully contrived, go nowhere and just aren't humorous. It's silly, but not very funny.
22811	4	a	Rigg adds the class to feature that Connery usually did. When she's gone, the action scenes are as fine as any Bond's.
22812	0	a	Surprisingly, given how hyper-articulate everyone is, the duo's most potent scenes are wordless, conveying a wealth of emotion in glances and gestures.
22813	0	a	Even in its harrowing final moments, it reaches a spiritually transcendent pinnacle - the idea of ending one long, strange trip and plummeting into an even-greater unknown with both fear and elation. A stirring American drama of comfort and conflict.
22814	5	a	The final pitch is a big miss.
22815	7	a	Strictly for kids, and, as the three or four people who saw Oedekerk's previous directing effort, Kung Pow: Enter the Fist, can attest, the writer/director tends to stretch even throwaway jokes minutes past the punch line.
22816	0	a	"The Artist"" is a delightful treasure. It is a charming mixture of comedy, melodrama and romance that cinema lovers should make a point of experiencing."
22817	4	a	"Gondry's ""Green Hornet"" does not have a serious bone in his body. Its goal is to satirize superhero motifs - mainly, the idea of the ethnic sidekick."
22818	3	a	The saddest part is seeing him being given to a family with no expertise with animals or sign language and then having to adapt to too many different and increasingly restrictive types of lifestyles as he's moved from one place to another.
22819	0	a	The first movie was the setup, and this one is the payoff.
22820	6	a	In the end, this just deteriorates into a mediocre suspense flick.
22821	2	a	Is it worth a look? Sure. Is it begging to be parodied? Without a doubt...somebody alert the Wayans.
22822	6	a	The two TV writers have taken a premise ripe with potential for laughter and social commentary and turned into a hackneyed sitcom.
22823	6	a	Am I the only critic willing to talk about how offensive the elementary school spirit squad scene is?
22824	1	a	It's a feel-good movie you won't feel guilty for enjoying, or even loving.
22825	4	a	A muddled focus keeps We Bought a Zoo from being a guaranteed hit with kids or a captivating adult drama but there are enough compelling moments to make it worthwhile.
22826	3	a	Clever, often fascinating look at the world of glam rock.
22827	9	a	doesn't just violate the audience's right to entertainment, it violates animal dignity to such an extent that PETA might want to consider getting involved
22828	2	a	[The Predator] doesn't reach the heights it could have, but it's still a very entertaining time at the theater that will leave audiences smiling and laughing amidst the carnage.
22829	4	a	[Director] Wong and [writer] Morgan honed their skills on The X-Files, Millenium and The Commish and it shows in their ability to create suspense and tension as well as carnage.
22830	3	a	"I asked my son what was his favourite part and his answer wasn't ""I loved the joke about autofill. It totally rang true with my experience of Google's browser data."" "
22831	2	a	Some of the best comedies these days can be found in the indie market and, whilst Kings of Summer isn't one of the better ones, it is enjoyable.
22832	6	a	The episodic script is all verve and no wit, a relentless tribute to nonconformity that starts to exhaust its goofiness after the first hour.
22833	8	a	How fascinating that a film about super-humans was made by a collection of sub-humans; what a topsy-turvy world in which we live.
22834	3	a	So, just book a reservation to see this movie already.
22835	9	a	Belongs in the too-hot-for-TV direct-to-video/DVD category, and this is why I have given it a one-star rating.
22836	8	a	Daddy Day Camp should just limp off to the nurse's tent and call it quits.
22837	4	a	Law ... gives an honest, pitch-perfect performance in a film that is otherwise unremarkable.
22838	3	a	What Boleyn Girl lacks in character development, it makes up in vigor, immediacy and intelligence.
22839	6	a	That the movie is able to suspend disbelief for as long as it does is a testament to David Duchovny's likability as an actor.
22840	5	a	Gallo's poor, poor pitiful me routine wears very thin, very fast, but Ricci is incandescent, a softly-glowing dumpling of a dream-girl in powder-blue fishnet tights and sparkly tap shoes.
22841	3	a	It's bound to remind viewers of The Mad Max/Road Warrior movies with its silences and baking-hot open spaces. When characters do speak, the language sounds lyrical and sometimes profound.
22842	0	a	After a summer of cookie-cutter comedies and blowsy action flicks, Neil LaBute's Nurse Betty is good for what ails you.
22843	7	a	A film that may not breach national security, but is an unfortunate breach of talent.
22844	5	a	Surprising Vin Diesel vehicle: first, for the initial switcheroo from supernatural action-adventure to supernatural whodunit; second, for a sturdily built storyline; third, for a somewhat lively and lighthearted turn from its often somnolent star. 
22845	3	a	There's enough material here for a solid, heartfelt period love story -- it may not make viewers swoon the way a good Jane Austen adaptation might, but it's well enough made to deliver an emotional impact.
22846	3	a	"While ""Palo Alto"" might not point the teen genre into revolutionary new directions, it does achieve a major goal: Putting its talented filmmaker and cast on the cinematic map."
22847	4	a	A tale of life needlessly lost by a young man who realizes too late that reckless self-reliance is not necessarily the path to self-awareness. That he fails to realize this sooner is tragic; that the film celebrates the misunderstanding is bewildering.
22848	5	a	It's basically a Spielberg movie inside an ode to Spielberg movies.
22849	0	a	Tim Burton magic with just a touch of scariness.
22850	0	a	This remains one of the most approachable and moving of all cinema's masterpieces.
22851	3	a	Great movie, but not quite true to history.
22852	1	a	A mesmerizingly suspenseful drama.
22853	4	a	"Aniston defines the term ""bored to tears"" with her portrayal of the morose ""Justine."
22854	9	a	It turns out to be a really manipulative, self-congratulatory film about a pack of people who learn to treat a handicapped black man like a human being. Goody for them.
22855	4	a	The film's clever gimmick holds up well, despite a cold, clinical tone.
22856	3	a	A damning portrait of cold-hearted greed.
22857	2	a	I feel like Eli Roth kind of revitalized himself with this picture...I'd love to see what else he can do with this kind of film.
22858	0	a	"With a solid-gold cast and a sterling script, ""American Hustle"" has a higher return on investment than any other movie in the marketplace."
22859	6	a	As the first attempt at a photo-realistic animated movie, this is definitely worth seeing on the big screen.
22860	3	a	At the end, there is no great revelation, but Huppert has succeeded once again in making us wonder what's going on in there.
22861	2	a	I did not expect much of this movie, but it turned out better than I expected. It is very funny, with lots of jokes from movies and popular culture.
22862	4	a	Where Cruise's deference helped elevate his previous two films to artistic heights, his egotism has deflated his latest.
22863	4	a	"While I wish the story could have been a bit more balanced, ""The Dressmaker"" boasts great performances by all involved and cashes in on its silly, and occasionally dark, humor. "
22864	3	a	Clint's direction is sometimes shaky but usually assured, and he gets a bold performance from Jessica Walter.
22865	6	a	Alpha Dog, a tale of a group of drug-fueled teenagers, is gritty to the point of painful abrasion.
22866	6	a	It plays like six subplots in search of a sitcom.
22867	6	a	The audiences for whom 'The Expendables' represents a wish belatedly fulfilled aren't expecting Shakespeare, but Stallone, once an Oscar-nominated screenwriter, is strictly on autopilot here. 
22868	5	a	Matchstick Men is directed with confidence by Ridley Scott.
22869	1	a	Charismatically played by Rooney Mara in David Fincher's coolly executed, moody rendition of Stieg Larsson's book, this tattooed girl really does kick a hornet's nest. 
22870	9	a	Populated solely with hateful characters...strictly for connoisseurs of crass.
22871	3	a	This film is eccentric, extravagant, and electrifying.
22872	4	a	The picture isn't as consistently funny as its reputation would suggest, but Marvin is terrific.
22873	3	a	The stars outshine the production
22874	3	a	Greg Berlanti's charmingly heartfelt film is a remarkably successful attempt to give shape to the experience of the closet by drawing an incredibly intimate portrait of a teenage boy about to leave it behind.
22875	5	a	The picture is dragged down by shallow staging, hugely broad characterisation and some unevenly matched struggles between actor and accent.
22876	4	a	It has the courtesy to tie up everything with a nice little bow, plus the nifty special effects climax of [the] serious wallop at the end. . .
22877	5	a	Despite the conventional military spin on the old kill the dragon story, the film never really succeeds or goes far enough in being either a taut action thriller or purposefully over the top camp.
22878	5	a	The Last Witch Hunter has some great production design and digital effects, but the movie directed by Breck Eisner is an interminable bore, which foolishly places the weight of the film on Vin Diesel's broad shoulders.
22879	4	a	It's very funny at times, sports an excellent cast, and is often very entertaining.
22880	2	a	...touching...heartwarming...sentimental and funny...innocuous but sweet, I couldn't help but smile through most of it.
22881	0	a	The real magic of Chicken Run is how personable it is, how easy and effortlessly it tells its story.
22882	3	a	As Toula, the frump who blossoms into a flower, Nia Vardalos delivers a lovely performance.
22883	3	a	The plot is a touch obvious, but Menashe still plays like a more culturally specific Kramer vs. Kramer, setting up a testy, fascinating dynamic between micromanaging rabbis and a naturally warm dad with wisdom of his own.
22884	1	a	A weirdly amusing parable of sexual repression.
22885	4	a	It's basically innocuous, more or less predictable and mildly diverting. And if it didn't star Michael Caine, Robert Duvall and Haley Joel Osment, it would probably be insufferable.
22886	5	a	The biggest problem, ironically, is that even though the plot and the action center on smoking pot, it's not enough of a stoner flick.
22887	4	a	It's clear immediately that Payne is going for a nostalgic, unabashedly old-school feel...
22888	3	a	Cumming's performance as Pooh is one of the best vocal performances since Scarlett Johansson in Her and actually deserves awards conversation. 
22889	0	a	The performances are uniformly superb.
22890	3	a	A dark twisted comedy that has strong performances making it one of the most memorable films of this year.
22891	9	a	'A lot of what gets called entertainment today is actually dumpster-diving for the mind' applies to this incomprehensible, incoherent supernatural thriller.
22892	3	a	Saint Laurent understands that the surface is the substance here...
22893	5	a	With another rewrite and some more focused direction, Trevorrow could have exploited the potential in his story and provided a worthy platform for Plaza, whose deadpan lead performance is excellent.
22894	2	a	Full of obvious humour and stereotyped characters, My Big Fat Greek Wedding is nonetheless delightful, mostly because the movie does not pretend to be anything it isn't.
22895	3	a	Though it's a triumph of visual futurism and an ornament to sci-fi cinema as well as to cinema in general, I resist it on some level.
22896	4	a	Respectful, dignified, and a little dull.
22897	3	a	We've seen it dozens of times: Cute kid disarms perpetually grumpy old man. But the touching French drama Monsieur Ibrahim turns one of Hollywood's oft-worked formats inside-out: It's the old man who is cute and the kid who is the sourpuss.
22898	4	a	Kendrick needs to learn that didacticism isn't a film aesthetic.
22899	0	a	"Russell Crowe is as believable a Spaniard here as Charlton Heston was a Mexican in ""Touch of Evil."" But director Ridley Scott took greater interest in entwining an empire's intrigue with its people's turmoil than emphasizing bread-and-circus brutality."
22900	4	a	How could we possibly reconnect with the primal urges of speed-demon street racers, without Vin's din? The answer, in two words: Vroom. Vroom.
22901	5	a	Celtic Pride supplies predictably lowbrow yocks for jocks, and its rather disturbing racial implications go entirely unacknowledged.
22902	3	a	Ultimately, thanks to a sympathetic and nuanced performance from Lustig, Menashe offers a thoughtful portrait of the challenge of parenthood and the struggle to be a man and a father. 
22903	4	a	A well-acted, powerful, deep film spotlighted by commanding performances.
22904	3	a	"The new ""Tattoo"" is buoyed by Fincher's peerless craftsmanship. Never has a director been better suited to photographing winter scenes near the Arctic Circle."
22905	4	a	The FF are unpretentious and nerdy and they bicker with each other, giving the film a loose, buoyant quality in between action sequences.
22906	1	a	"Droll and witty, Burton's tribute evokes the career of Hollywood's ""worst"" director by making a most stylishly polished production"
22907	3	a	A filmmaker of Jordan's capability is not likely to make anything less than a competent, watchable movie, and that Michael Collins is.
22908	9	a	The Road Chip is the cinematic equivalent of an air ball. It doesn't matter how pretty your form is or how expensive your shoes are; if you're aiming the ball at the wrong target, the result is going to look really, really bad.
22909	1	a	Like most serial killer stories, Monster isn't easy to watch. Thanks to Theron and the rock-steady work of those around her, it's equally difficult to forget.
22910	4	a	Veronica Mars is a delightful piece of fan service - a supersized TV reunion episode expanded for viewing in movie theaters.
22911	6	a	"The behavior of the two main charactres exists solely to be ""cute,"" while giving us no reason to believe these two people should be together in the first place."
22912	0	a	Love and intimacy between two male characters has never truly felt this real or emotionally heartbreaking.
22913	3	a	The sweet, dizzy finale makes up for all the predictability before it.
22914	0	a	It may be coincidence that Selma reverberates with a particular timeliness...Still, it's thanks to director DuVernay and first-time features writer Paul Webb that the film has more than the luck of timing on its side.
22915	2	a	With his deadpan delivery and snide quips, Murray more than holds his own amid the myriad state-of-the-art special effects.
22916	3	a	While Cate Blanchett has been nabbing all the praise, the actual protagonist of the piece, played by Rooney Mara, manages to match the top-billed star with a performance every bit as committed, subtle, moving and intense.
22917	3	a	The celluloid equivalent of insanity
22918	4	a	Beautifully acted, sensitively written, and actually rather moving.
22919	1	a	a penetrating exercise in escalating dread and despair
22920	4	a	The found-footage genre means anyone can now make a horror film. Whether anyone will want to watch it is another issue. This one, allowing for Rosemary's Baby borrowings, is medium-crafty and well crafted.
22921	4	a	...A strange, brooding story vastly different from its TV ancestor, and it will soon slip indistinctly from the public consciousness and into video stores, which is where it belongs.
22922	0	a	"[PODCAST] As Thomas Wolf pointed out in his essay, Christ's primary teaching was that ""loneliness could be destroyed forever by the life of love."" Is ""First Reformed"" a perfect film? Yes, yes it is."
22923	1	a	Every actor here is top-notch, and the sense of fun and give-and-take is palpably enjoyable.
22924	0	a	Chicken Run should be seen by the whole family. Actually, it should be seen by everyone.
22925	4	a	The formulaic narrative is made unpredictable by the authentic surroundings and the potential complications of religion. But it's still formulaic.
22926	4	a	Here is a family that entrenched itself in the American imagination by campaigning on symbolism, and Chappaquiddick hits its better strides when it turns the camera on the relationship between its stars and script doctors.
22927	3	a	Despite the flaws I've dwelled on here, I feel real affection for Ghostbusters. How could you not? It's goofy, funny, homey - it's genuine comfort food
22928	3	a	If you like intelligent thrillers, political drama, or skilful dramatizations of history, then you're going to love Thirteen Days.
22929	3	a	"A rather exceptionally counter-cultural ""teen movie""...raises authentic youth concerns and answers them with convincing integrity."
22930	3	a	If you're a novice, this is a plucky introduction to Whedon's world and the most fun sci-fi of the year. If you're a devotee, this is the magnificent return you've been praying for.
22931	0	a	Martin McDonagh's pulsatingly enjoyable film is a thriller, a dissection of small-town America, and a forensic study of what makes ordinary people tick, all in one.
22932	4	a	As well intentioned and sometimes well acted as this film is, it is not always able to rise above its own earnest agenda in order to tell its story in an absorbing manner.
22933	4	a	These characters are much more interesting on paper than they prove to be when fleshed out over the course of the picture.
22934	2	a	Just the fact this film exists in the first place is something we need to celebrate, even if the end result is a little too safe.
22935	1	a	An emotionally rich romantic thriller about marriage, parenting, and the spiritual choices that sometimes come with both.
22936	4	a	A multi-villain axis of evil and a pulpy vision that feels machine-hacked.
22937	6	a	Hoffman...is like the one kid in gym class who takes Frisbee golf seriously.
22938	6	a	It's hard to know what to make of the thing, though it has a sleazy charm.
22939	5	a	One problem with the film is that it's only in the acquisition of money and the community subjugating their own savings and needs for George, that his rebirth can be complete.
22940	3	a	This is almost Mel Brooks territory: The frontiersmen think the Chinese are Jews, while the white settlers think it's the Sioux who are. This is equal-opportunity nuttiness, and there's a method to it.
22941	2	a	The Prestige is plot-heavy, but it has its moments.
22942	8	a	Just one long pratfall...an avalanche of really dumb action comedy that aims to be a variant on the Inspector Clouseau formula but fails miserably.
22943	3	a	The carnivalesque chaos is anchored in stage actor John Neville's charismatic lead turn.
22944	0	a	Selma is a triumphant no hold barred and amazingly directed biopic, with a gripping depth in the story and strong performances all around especially from David Oyelowo.
22945	6	a	Uwe Boll had nothing to do with this movie, but it has his general feeling of murkiness and poor plot structure.
22946	6	a	I really, really like Kevin James. But this is disappointing.
22947	4	a	It pulls off what has hitherto seemed an impossible feat: staying true to the spirit of the video game on which it was based, and simultaneously, breathing new life into the concept.
22948	6	a	Where the movie fails completely is the most important, meat-and-potatoes parts. Namely, the main characters and a compelling, believable story line. These are both lacking.
22949	3	a	We see history as it unfolds, not as it has been encased in amber, in a movie that needs to be seen in these anxious days of renewed racial and cultural unrest.
22950	6	a	Nowhere near as good as its stars due to stagy dialogue, but still a sweet experience.
22951	6	a	Has fun performances, but its loose storytelling and lack of adventure just makes this family film downright mediocre. 
22952	3	a	There are a ton of visual effects, but most are very well done and convincing. I can't praise the film enough for feeling fresh and different. The cinematography is well done, and the atmospheric set pieces are gothic and gorgeous.
22953	3	a	A gorgeous, textured, meaningful, multimedia shadow play; appreciate it as deeply as you like
22954	4	a	It cheapens itself by hitting some self-congratulatory notes, but until it does it covers some fascinating rock 'n' roll ground.
22955	2	a	A darkly comical satire about affluence might seem a bit ill-timed during a global recession. But a strong cast makes this film very watchable, even as it slips into melodrama.
22956	3	a	A moving little slice-of-life gem, unassumingly big in existential significance.
22957	9	a	A patently silly, uninteresting thriller that's devoid of surprises.
22958	2	a	Sets up its mysteries with an admirable tenacity, though the resolution we're ultimately offered is more than a bit forgettable.
22959	5	a	Nothing much happens beyond one defining incident relatively early on.
22960	9	a	What do you get when you make a movie out of a comic book that's not worth reading?
22961	3	a	Macabre, jet-black comedy with Polanski's unique sensibility in evidence in abundance.
22962	3	a	A surprisingly complex examination of the personal and professional price of honesty; falsehoods, half-truths, little white lies and self-delusion.
22963	2	a	Easily outdoes the first Ralph.
22964	5	a	Ridiculous and pretentious and just plain nutty
22965	3	a	Stump is well-played by affable Robert Wuhl, who has the unenviable responsibility of representing the one sane man in Ty's crazy universe.
22966	3	a	A purely auteur-driven lark slipped into an era when studios no longer want to work with directors with personality and pesky calls for final cut - a high entertainment with a handmade feel.
22967	4	a	Could stand to focus more on scrupulous sociocultural history and less on compulsively entertaining the audience...has enough untold story and acting chops to make it worthwhile.
22968	6	a	A perfect example of each of the steps followed by femenine comedy after the success of Bridesmaids, but with little variation. [Full review in Spanish]
22969	7	a	Why in the name of ermine boleros would anyone make such a dull, coy and, worst of all, pretty film about Anne Boleyn?
22970	6	a	The big set piece at the end is impressive...proving that Stallone really is a formidable action director. It is just a pity it takes so long to get there. 
22971	4	a	The result seems almost as hypocritical as many of the movie's targets, which ultimately defeats the movie's intentions.
22972	3	a	Literate and funny, light-hearted yet frequently eloquent
22973	4	a	The mystery in Secret Window won't be too hard to pry open.
22974	5	a	It's more Jay Leno than Jon Stewart, and there's no way that's a compliment.
22975	3	a	What is most valuable about Amistad is the way it provides faces and names for its African characters, whom the movies so often make into faceless victims.
22976	3	a	Alfie is embodied -- quite nicely -- by Jude Law, who is still a cad but more of a lad than Caine ever seemed.
22977	9	a	This movie is all over the place.
22978	5	a	Listen to the audience as they leave the theatre. Are they talking about being moved by honor and justice, or going 'wow' at the bloodshed so spectacularly delivered?
22979	9	a	This wasn't the heralded gamechanger. This was a studio desperately attempting to dump a disastrous film, but use a clever PR stunt to fool us all into watching it.
22980	3	a	The Farrelly brothers should take notes.
22981	3	a	Moore's own face starts to become as bare a cupboard as her mind. It's more than the no-make-up look. First, lines of doubt and fear map her face. Then starts to come a blankness like infantilism.
22982	7	a	Mostly, Not Easily Broken is a pat portrayal of a marriage, neither overly dull nor especially engaging.
22983	3	a	More than just another zombie movie, a better zombie movie.
22984	1	a	A rowdy, richly offbeat biopic.
22985	0	a	Zhao has shown herself to be a wonderful storyteller, and I can't wait to see what she does next.
22986	1	a	It's a wonderfully realized film, one of Woody's best, that has slipped under the radar.
22987	3	a	Sincere and touching.
22988	6	a	Instead of the easy laughs, Schneider and Brady are going for something a little deeper.
22989	6	a	There's nothing to grasp, nothing that gives off that good feeling of enjoying a comedy.
22990	2	a	"Larry Crowne"" is such a perfectly pleasant movie that it may not be until you walk toward the exit that you realize that something is missing. "
22991	4	a	The destination may never be in doubt, but thanks to likeable performances from stars Lily Collins and Sam Claflin this predictable film has a heart and soul that keeps it watchable for the duration.
22992	4	a	[Bell] makes Billy the angelic urchin joyous in a streetwise, unphony way, and his dancing, which fuses classical ballet rigor with a loose jointed pop showmanship, is electric.
22993	2	a	A strong high concept heist thriller, sometimes hindered by the predictability of the genre and it's marketing but regularly salvaged by the movie's strong direction and the quality of the cast.
22994	4	a	Live-action/animation mix is good fun for kids.
22995	6	a	Trouble in paradise. That's the overly familiar premise of this sun-poisoned comedy.
22996	7	a	This isn't necessarily a contender for worst movie of the year, but good heavens--how can you make a movie about a plane crash so boring?
22997	5	a	Marred by some of the same problems as Harlin's version -- namely, weak supporting characters, unintentionally funny dialogue and poorly executed special effects.
22998	6	a	...has plenty of energy and affection, but not much purpose.
22999	3	a	Gorgeous and anchored by a flinty performance from Abbie Cornish, it's a mystery as to why this Jane Campion period piece fades away rather than catches fire.
23000	4	a	Solid Filmmaking and Solid Performances
23001	1	a	the film asks us to consider the very nature and purpose of our existence in a fragmentary, superficial and transient universe.
23002	5	a	Great cast, terrible premise, done ultra-cheap. Sad Supes had to go out like this.
23003	3	a	A film for any lost soul, anyone trying to figure where their life is headed and if they're happy about it.
23004	6	a	MacFarlane and co-writers Alec Sulkin and Wellesley Wild have a gift for referential riffs, but the plot is the thinnest of narratives just to connect all the comedy bits.
23005	2	a	Seen in a flashback through the eyes of an adolescent, this uncommon coming-of-age tale, which raises poignant questions about the mysteries of sex and love, flaunts a superb performance from Laura Dern as the promiscuous girl
23006	0	a	Challenging, intelligent, it emcompasses the best and worst of human nature with unflinching precision and wistful melancholy
23007	4	a	An okay, heartwarming time.
23008	6	a	...not a terrifically memorable piece of filmmaking.
23009	5	a	As dry as an opened pack of military rations left to bake under the Kabul sun.
23010	3	a	What you end up with is a mess of ideas and silly asides, but one that for some of us is an intelligent pleasure to wade through.
23011	2	a	A solid date movie for science geeks and philosophy freaks alike.
23012	5	a	Even when well-intentioned - which I believe this movie is - broad, sweeping, can't-we-all-just-get-along moralizing only opens the door for cringe-worthy moments, which this movie has plenty of.
23013	3	a	Glenn Close's singular accomplishment in willing Albert Nobbs to the screen is the stuff actors dream about.
23014	4	a	We get recycled plot elements from a dozen other movies, many of them better, and just enough suspense to keep it from turning to a complete disaster.
23015	4	a	Roll Bounce features taut skate choreography, but its storytelling isn't nearly so coordinated.
23016	7	a	There is ... something about [the immortals] getting a special charge when they actually manage to kill each other. Personally, I would have gotten a really big charge if I could have killed them all.
23017	4	a	The story unfolds simply, with respect for its young viewers and their view of the world. The animation is bright and colorful, with lively characters that will surely delight children.
23018	3	a	Lazenby isn't all that bad, really. Top Bond production overall helps.
23019	6	a	Prison biopic that's more interested in its liberal message about prison reform working for redemption than in anything else.
23020	1	a	Grander statements aren't needed when the specific indictments are so plentiful and so horrifying.
23021	1	a	I can't deny the performances throughout are stellar, but a better ending could have taken this film from good to great.
23022	4	a	A solidly absorbing drama held together by Neeson's stern, steely performance.
23023	1	a	Grip your theater seats and prepare to be entertained.
23024	5	a	The problem is that Wayans and his raft of writers, including his brothers Marlon and Shawn, who are also among the film's stars, begin on such an extreme, in-your-face note that they have no place to go.
23025	10	a	A perfect bore that flunks every cinematic test.
23026	0	a	The wild and wonderful adventures of an oddball outsider with a terrible physical affliction who makes the most out of his journey in the company of a lovable band of eccentrics and misfits.
23027	4	a	The film ends up getting stuck in a no man's land between fiction and documentary, never quite coming together as a complete narrative.
23028	3	a	Seth Rogen is a genius. Lucky, really, that I never liked hot dogs anyway.
23029	3	a	It's the camera trickery and the playful art direction that send up the entire image of the badass yakuza to begin with.
23030	5	a	The dancing is king. So if you can't stand the heat of competition, stay out of the kitchen.
23031	6	a	By allowing himself to be talked into doing this Harris has diluted and sullied his most storied creating, robbing Lecter of much of his power to fill our dreams with dread and our nightmares with bloodcurdling screams of the shocking.
23032	0	a	Russell exhibits a sure hand with his subject matter, from Camus' absurdism to Buddhism's unity of the universe, to his dogged optimism about it all
23033	6	a	Woman Walks Ahead is too often one step behind in making us care.
23034	6	a	Paper Heart is like a really special five-minute YouTube clip that goes on for an hour and a half.
23035	4	a	It works. That's the most and the least that can be said of this frequently funny romcom.
23036	9	a	Kids facing the SAT in real life may appreciate this movie, if only because it'll make them feel so much smarter than these characters. For the rest of us, it flunks.
23037	4	a	While it's fascinating to watch the killer evolve, the fact that he's always onscreen detracts from his mystique. Hannibal derives much of his intrigue from his mystery.
23038	4	a	Trey Edward Shults, who made the powerful, harrowing Krisha, returns with a dark movie that's meticulously crafted and highly intelligent but also relentlessly pessimistic and deeply unsettling.
23039	3	a	A bittersweet, deeply human tale, one with a documentary sense of discovery to its setting: a little seen, highly insular ultraorthodox Jewish community.
23040	4	a	Anyone who sees this as their first and only example of silent cinema will believe that the entire era was devoted to silly trifles, when, in fact, many artistic masterpieces were produced during that time. 
23041	3	a	Although the exposition effectively invokes cool, the gradual warming trend finally gives this film a resonance beyond immediate impact.
23042	1	a	Totally engrossing from start to finish.
23043	4	a	The result is just as the filmmakers hoped. You'd have to hold a stubborn defensive line not to be moved by this film's heart.
23044	1	a	This is the year's epic western, and one wonders why it took so long to get out of the cutting room. See it.
23045	6	a	Alfie is a bore.
23046	10	a	Every once in a while, a movie comes along that seems to have been made merely so those involved in the production could have an awesome vacation.
23047	6	a	I laughed, but it was at the expense of my pride.
23048	6	a	A routine B Western.
23049	5	a	Dragon Blade is undercut by woeful miscasting and tonal shifts that veer from drama to comedy and maudlin overreach.
23050	5	a	Netflix truly prevailed big time, fooling us into thinking this would be good. Those execs must be laughing themselves silly right now.
23051	2	a	Cahill's script says all scientists are romantics at heart, then bears that out through a floaty story that's simultaneously about the mechanics of a huge discovery and the feelings it stirs.
23052	4	a	Will please its many fans, but plot might confuse kids.
23053	3	a	... great fun ... 
23054	5	a	Draggin' about dragons
23055	1	a	One of the best Bond pictures ever...a satisfying blend of the old and the new.
23056	1	a	A precision-tooled entertainment made by experts, and sometimes more than that. Watching it is like finding money in the pocket of a coat that you haven't worn in years.
23057	4	a	A fast-paced, unpredictable and edgy yarn that breathes new life into the espionage thriller genre.
23058	4	a	Although Astro Boy has its moments, in a movie year already crowded with animated successes, it may not have the superhuman strength to stand out.
23059	1	a	It's a rollicking adventure for you and all your mateys, regardless of their ages.
23060	2	a	It is unquestionably overwrought, but it is a truly lovely film with a lot of emotion in it. The meaning of all that emotion is unfortunately still up for grabs.
23061	4	a	There's plenty to enjoy here.
23062	3	a	Boyle's visual panache and rapid-fire storytelling bounce around the characters, while Lodge keeps the mile-a-minute dialogue sharp.
23063	3	a	There's enough good stuff to justify action fan attendance.
23064	2	a	Barcelona lends an intoxicating sparkle to a movie that's best when it speaks with affection for its youthful characters, inhabitants of an untidy world in which no dirty dish wants for company in a crowded kitchen sink.
23065	2	a	"This surprisingly charming mix of Harry Potter, ""A Christmas Story"" and ""Hugo"" has enough creepiness for the kids while adults can enjoy the Addams Family by way of Tim Burton production design and Blanchett's amusing eccentricity."
23066	1	a	The humor magnifies the horror, and vice versa. Like the inflammatory Dr. Strangelove, we've sewn these seeds, and we deserve whatever is reaped from them.
23067	0	a	Funny and touching in equal measure. The warmth of Nebraska makes you feel all good inside.
23068	4	a	Lions will appeal to a more mature audience because of the solid acting duo of Caine and Duvall. It will also appeal to children because of its almost mythological feel.
23069	1	a	Ejiofor and Cheadle are a force to be reckoned with...
23070	0	a	A brilliant blend of fast-paced comedy, dazzling visuals and heartfelt emotion that put most other contemporary films-animated or otherwise-to shame...
23071	2	a	It's one of the better animated movies of the year--admittedly, rising to the top of a shallow pool.
23072	3	a	Like the sex, drugs, and politics that are fodder for the script, the question of what happens when we leave this world is addressed directly, and with the same fulsome sense of mischief. 
23073	5	a	When the plot feels like you've seen it three times before, and done better on each of those occasions, the movie better have something else going for it. Identity Thief doesn't.
23074	5	a	It's sort of ironic that the only demographic that'll appreciate this lame, watered-down brand of humor mirrors the community portrayed in the film: the elderly and infirm
23075	6	a	As a forced, unnecessary addition to the series, it lacks a satisfying relationship to its predecessors while simply rehashing the original's plot ...
23076	4	a	In [Theron's] hands what might have been an extreme-acting stunt is instead an abrasive study in bitter, lethal desperation.
23077	2	a	It's funny but fitful.
23078	3	a	makes me cry every time
23079	4	a	When it works, it's uniquely funny. When it doesn't, it's uniquely bad.
23080	6	a	Rupert Everett also expertly mangles the plum role once inhabited by Alastair Sim.
23081	4	a	The Cloverfield Paradox works moderately...but being the third part of this saga, stumbles... [Full review in Spanish]
23082	3	a	Kevin Kline's tour de force, a performance of uncommon joie de vivre.
23083	4	a	You should take brownies, instead of popcorn, to Inherent Vice. 
23084	6	a	The familiarity of its humour would be easier to forgive if its narrative ambitions weren't equally recognizable.
23085	2	a	While I would recommend David Fincher's The Curious Case of Benjamin Button as worth seeing, I simply cannot work up any great love for it.
23086	1	a	The antidote to M:i:III, Pirates II and every other circus of coagulated stunts is Miami Vice, my favorite Hollywood movie of the summer so far.
23087	3	a	"All I can say is that I really enjoyed Serenity, and I plan on getting my hands on that ""Firefly"" DVD to see what I missed."
23088	3	a	Another fine Loach film that refuses to sentimentalize the plight of the poor and disenfranchised. Compston is a real find.
23089	10	a	It's two things and both of them suck.
23090	0	a	Selma is an important history lesson that never feels like a lecture. Once school is back in session, every junior high school class in America should take a field trip to see this movie.
23091	4	a	Joe Wright, who did a brilliant job with Atonement, powerfully reveals the terrible treatment of America's homeless community.
23092	6	a	A little manipulative but generally satisfying story worthy of commemoration.
23093	4	a	If there were any more testosterone here, Jose Canseco could have boiled down the screen and injected it.
23094	5	a	Even Tom Hanks and Julia Roberts can't sell this lightweight rom-com fantasy.
23095	3	a	Very funny, packed with solid action, animated with a remarkable degree of care and creativity, and delivered with a breathless sense of energy.
23096	1	a	...rapid-fire youth-culture freak show: random sex, in-your-face scatology, senseless violence and rampant profanity delivered in haggis-thick brogues.
23097	2	a	Watching The Hobbit was an unexpected endurance test. Younger children will not last the pace, but plucky ten year olds with a couple of well timed toilet breaks will lap this up. 
23098	3	a	Has just enough craft to make it worth exploring.
23099	0	a	Lancaster is monumental.
23100	6	a	Must Love Dogs could have used a longer leash and a lot more frolicking in the park.
23101	3	a	It's thoroughly enjoyable family fare.
23102	4	a	The movie, with room to gallop through nearly two hours and an R rating, often just kicks around in the stable.
23103	7	a	In general, I hate these kinds of movies. I find them tedious, boring, pretentious and long-winded.
23104	3	a	It thrills in seeing dumb people getting their due in hyper-stylized displays of violence, and yet it never feels contemptuous of them.
23105	5	a	full of a counter-intuitive sunny optimism that is at odds with the tale itself
23106	3	a	An understated but weirdly grabbing portrait of a man who loses his memory after being mugged and cobbles together an alternative existence with minimal means.
23107	3	a	The Savages isn't so much about plot as about moments, and this film -- thanks to Linney and Hoffman -- is filled with keepers.
23108	1	a	Dear Todd Graff: Thanks, man.
23109	6	a	Banks entirely on the low standards of typical slasher movie fans.
23110	6	a	This hybrid, pleasant and inoffensive though it is, offers neither the insight of a good biopic nor the elation of a good sports drama.
23111	4	a	The central pair's shattering, once-in-a-lifetime passion cries out for more urgency and emotional power.
23112	7	a	Launch writes itself into such a corner that the only way it can manage a happy ending is to lock its leads in a room and force them to have a meaningful conversation.
23113	1	a	It's a great and memorable romp that will leave your family feeling super.
23114	4	a	Still Alice is hard to watch especially is you've dealt with a similar real life situation; you know there is no good outcome. But as population grows, so does the number of sufferers. It's time a brave film like this shed light on a dark corner.
23115	3	a	Surprisingly good natured given its take-no-prisoners lampooning of ethnic and cultural stereotypes, the war in Iraq, homosexuality, AIDS... not to mention Hollywood's finest.
23116	3	a	Tanovic adroitly indicts the entrenched hostilities between people and nations. 
23117	3	a	Superior sci-fi horror.
23118	8	a	This second helping of MacFarlane's smugly lowbrow hijinks [is] well-nigh unbearable....a juvenile stream of drug gags, penis-centric jokes, pop culture riffs and other raunchy stuff ladled out with a sluggish, leaden hand. 
23119	4	a	Too many coincidental plot points to be believable.
23120	5	a	...the film is about as brainless as the Griswalds themselves.
23121	0	a	First Reformed is a tough, masterful movie. 
23122	5	a	First-time director Carl Rinsch's mega-budget take on one of Japan's most enduring legends feels like a folly that should never have been indulged.
23123	0	a	Blade Runner: The Final Cut plays better now than ever.
23124	0	a	"[VIDEO] ""Albert Nobbs"" is a melancholy film of enormous power that could easily slip through the cracks without the aid of the Oscar nominations it deserves to attract. Don't miss ""Albert Nobbs."
23125	2	a	"Featuring a fleet footed, witty performance from Hailee Steinfeld, who keeps Nadine sympathetic despite her bad behavior, ""The Edge of Seventeen"" is an entertaining reminder of how preconceived notions can cloud one's judgement."
23126	7	a	This is one of those movies where the grandiose vision is there, but it never gels.
23127	3	a	...Pike plays the hard-drinking, hard-smoking, hard-living Colvin to the hilt; it's painful to watch what she goes through in this role.
23128	1	a	A highly entertaining, immaculately produced drama about a genius-hero whose stiff-upper-lip resolve can't block a kick in the teeth when, years after the war, he is prosecuted for the 'crime' of homosexuality.
23129	3	a	Not much of a visual epic maybe, but an absorbing, exciting costume drama that works as a historical romance, a family tragedy and a showcase for its young stars.
23130	1	a	Soderbergh smoothly glides us through this NASCAR world, emanating an old-fashioned Hal Needham vibe, but with greater character depth and extra IQ points.
23131	9	a	The movie's outline has some promise, but the movie itself is leaden.
23132	6	a	Not scary, not suspenseful, not complex, not atmospheric.
23133	2	a	Without being a great movie, Selma is a more than worthy historical product. [Full review in Spanish]
23134	3	a	It's the movies' ultimate disaster epic: a genuinely unsettling movie experience that uses the new technology to create an alien invasion of unprecedented scale and realism.
23135	2	a	The tremendous cast is reason enough to give it a chance. Bening, Watts and Washington are at their very best.
23136	6	a	Instead of letting his reverence broaden him, Gibson uses his action-movie expertise to reduce the Crucifixion to something kinetic, literal and merely tragic.
23137	4	a	Unsurprisingly for a Del Toro film, the production design is the real star of Crimson Peak.
23138	0	a	An exotic and brilliant hothouse flower of a film.
23139	5	a	This cinematic claptrap is often so risible that it's no wonder I initially misread the name of the director, Sacha Gervasi, as Sacha Baron Cohen -- although I doubt even the helmer of Borat and Bruno could make a farce as outlandish as this movie.
23140	2	a	Daniel Craig's greatest Bond adventure yet... A shining example of what can be achieved when you combine blockbuster filmmaking with prestige talent.
23141	3	a	War of the Worlds' is a picture without a thought in its pretty head: the Tom Cruise movie to end all Tom Cruise movies.
23142	3	a	Jindabyne is not about just one murder but about the death by a thousand cuts that happens in its aftermath.
23143	4	a	It's charming, gently amusing and Rock Dog doesn't strum too loudly on his guitar.
23144	9	a	It's hard to get girls when you are a psychic, even if you look like Matt Damon.
23145	9	a	"Well...I've seen worse. And that's about the only recommendation I can make for ""Doom,"" yet another movie that's based on a video game."
23146	4	a	A big stampede of a movie with ideas and scenes thundering off in dozens of directions.
23147	3	a	Like Brown, the movie is dynamic and entertaining as hell.
23148	3	a	"A frequently entertaining precursor of ""Chicago"" with Rogers at her most charming. Let's just say she gives Renee Zellwegger a run for her money."
23149	3	a	It's a testament to Fincher's craftsmanship that even such a bleak message can evoke feelings of hope and wonder.
23150	1	a	Struggles mightily to win us over, and you have to appreciate the effort.
23151	5	a	Battle of the sexes romcom with mature content.
23152	3	a	The Coens return to their darker, earlier days and Brolin and Bardem deliver terrific performances.
23153	3	a	This is a film that wrestles with its themes through rigorously crafted dialogue; Schrader sees no benefit in underlining those words with showy camerawork or score, the film-making equivalent of going through the script with a neon highlighter pen.
23154	5	a	Uunevenly paced, mounts slowly to a sizzling prizefight sequence, which comes somewhere about the middle, then sags off to a long-drawn, agonized finish.
23155	4	a	Some actors are dinner. Kevin Kline is dessert, and his comic brio saves the film version of The Extra Man from its limitations.
23156	6	a	While Jonah Hex has its moments, it's ultimately yet another disappointing comic book adaptation.
23157	0	a	This rural drama is the best yet from playwright and filmmaker Martin McDonagh, and one of Frances McDormand's greatest performances.
23158	3	a	"Written during their own creative block, Joel and Ethan Coen's noirish satirical allegory decodes the myth of the ""sensitive"" artist, the mysteries of the creative process, and the ambiguities of Hollywood authorship."
23159	0	a	'Sausage Party' is an unrelenting whirlwind of lowbrow and objectionable jokes and situations that will make it difficult for you to catch your breath.
23160	4	a	Little of what it says about love or life is of much value, entertainment or otherwise.
23161	3	a	Zwart has a real flair for farce.
23162	0	a	Murray, as Bob, gives the performance of his career.
23163	6	a	The western deserves better. So do Smith, Kline and Branagh. So do Hayek and Sonnenfeld. And maybe even, heaven help us, so does The Wild, Wild West.
23164	4	a	Friends with Kids doesn't really understand kids very well. It also doesn't understand the friends. This entire world is about Julie and Jason. And even then, their neurosis and emotional entanglements seem a bit too... written.
23165	6	a	Though there are a handful of funny lines, the deeper observations are facile. The whole journey feels like a rich girl gone slumming.
23166	7	a	As far as Big Day experiences go, a drunken speech from a distant relative would be far more entertaining -- and funnier -- than The Wedding Date.
23167	5	a	The problem isn't that the jokes are crass; they're just not that funny.
23168	3	a	Cranston shines in 'Infiltrator.'
23169	4	a	The overall intent of the movie is not as gloomy or draining as the original. As a result, it's a blast to watch, but its emotional impact is minor.
23170	5	a	Converts an F. Scott Fitzgerald short story about a man aging backward into an overly long exercise in pseudo-profundity bearing little resemblance to its source.
23171	0	a	As funny, spooky and marvellous as ever.
23172	2	a	A lot of Ready Player One feels like the audience is watching a video game, but this is one time when I didn't mind not playing.
23173	8	a	Will Smith, what were you thinking?
23174	3	a	There's nothing new, but in the case of the Final Destination films, new is not necessary.
23175	6	a	Like an episode of Hitchcock's TV show, HITCHCOCK is entertaining but not great art. 
23176	9	a	I don't know how she does it. Wait, yes I do. I just don't care. 
23177	6	a	Affecting at times, but finally feels overblown and heavy-handed.
23178	1	a	A dour-faced but sublime comedy.
23179	1	a	It may not be the masterpiece that its narcissistic writer-director-star Vincent Gallo has claimed to be, but his filmmaking debut is a ceaselessly fascinating piece of work.
23180	3	a	We must be thankful that Beresford's grand, lucid and absorbing film tells [Li's] story with such passion and conviction.
23181	1	a	Doyle has lost none of his wild stylistic imagination, deploying dreamscapes, visual metaphors, perfect snatches of song, human-scale VFX and plenty of footage from the original film to tie them together perfectly, in tone, structure, style and feel. 
23182	6	a	The shameless manipulation on display here makes one wonder where Cameron Crowe's talent has gone.
23183	9	a	Uh, no.
23184	9	a	David Cronenberg meets Don DeLillo at last, and it's as if all the angels of heaven have come together. And said nothing.
23185	10	a	everybody should be ashamed
23186	6	a	I'm just not sure anyone could have turned this soap opera material into anything other than a sweeping, credibility-stretching, overwrought... soap opera.
23187	4	a	An enjoyable slice of solid entertainment that falls short of being a movie of greatness.
23188	4	a	Not for the faint of heart, the movie is unsettling and startlingly true to life.
23189	3	a	When it works, it works well; when it doesn't, it's not long before it does again. 
23190	1	a	This is an intense film. Music is kept to a minimum. Conversation is kept to a minimum. 
23191	0	a	Outstanding drama about MLK's fight for equal rights.
23192	3	a	That rare film about the sort of emotionally needy people who don't wear their neediness on their sleeves.
23193	6	a	Just another retread.
23194	6	a	Nothing more substantial than a fitfully clever doodle.
23195	4	a	Director Ava DuVernay...wisely shifts the emphasis away from the person - it's hard to make a movie about a saint, even a secular one - and onto the process.
23196	0	a	Cranks the absurdity of the narrative and the anxieties in frightening, analogous real-world neuroses we cling to long past sell-by dates. Sounds like a harshed mellow, but the whole thing is stoned immaculate. Your body will hurt from laughing.
23197	3	a	On the Fredo of the Kennedy clan.
23198	3	a	Knocked Up is half goofball guy-movie and half sentimental chick-flick, and it works on both levels, even if it does overstay its welcome.
23199	7	a	I would have loved to see more from the filmmakers, daring to fail while staking out some new terror incognita instead of just going through the motions of an experiment for which we already have the results.
23200	4	a	Not a bust, but less absorbing when all the Europeans talk Americanese.
23201	3	a	"Fast Five"" is easily one of the best in the series. Fast cars, romance, family ties and a heist comparable to that of ""Oceans Eleven""."
23202	3	a	...an ingenious Chinese box of a movie...
23203	5	a	Someone sent me this on tape. I may speak to them again one day.
23204	6	a	The movie plummets into a swamp of ever-increasing -- and increasingly amusing -- preposterosity. 
23205	6	a	Too much time and energy is directed toward that go-nowhere story, wasting the film's best asset, which is the low-key, lived-in rapport between Parker and Kinnear.
23206	6	a	Are we dead yet?
23207	0	a	Crimson Peak will make you believe in ghosts, but it will also make you believe in the magic of the movies yet again. 
23208	5	a	"John Carter's"" biggest miscalculation is the casting of Taylor Kitsch as Carter. He is too soft and wooden. He lacks the gravitas needed to be an inspirational leader, no matter how high or far he can jump in Barsoom's lesser gravity."
23209	0	a	Pure movie gold of the most sophisticated kind. 
23210	4	a	Deserves no respect.
23211	4	a	The filming techniques cross Saving Private Ryan with Zimou's own Hero and other dynastic, martial arts-driven Chinese epics.
23212	4	a	About halfway through the film it shifts gears... One wishes [they] had focused on a single story and saw it through.
23213	0	a	The entire cast seems to have found the roles for which they were best suited. Together they give a passionate, energetic and emotional performance worthy of an Oscar win on every level.
23214	2	a	Though uneven, there's much to like about this entertaining portrait of a working marriage and marriage work, including Helen Mirren's Oscar-caliber performance as the unsung heroine, Hitchcock's devoted wife and crucial collaborator
23215	0	a	So many different shades of wrong all wrapped up in one movie that, even as I sit to write this, I'm unsure whether I was howling with laughter or begging for it to stop.
23216	2	a	Despite familiar cinematic tropes of post-civilization, grim and violent emphasis of desolation and destruction make this a thrilling road trip through outback's near future.
23217	4	a	Simple, it is as by-the-books formulaic as can be, and there's not a surprise around that the corner that isn't obvious immediately.
23218	1	a	A haunting achievement.
23219	1	a	Reminisce, if you can, over genderless fashions, boys in makeup and girls in even more makeup. And don't forget those platform shoes, drugs, and glitter, glitter everywhere.
23220	0	a	moves beyond slapstick as it's skillfully and energetically put together to tell much about Americana.
23221	0	a	American Dreamz pulls off that rare feat of shooting at dozens of big targets, and hitting so many of them that we want to stand up and cheer because someone even tried.
23222	6	a	Punishingly long and slow in parts.
23223	3	a	It makes for a satisfying summer moviegoing experience.
23224	2	a	There can be worse holiday fluff than watching a tight-knit group of Hollywood veterans having fun.
23225	4	a	Shot in grainy, high-contrast black-and-white with a lot of simple but effective optical and aural tricks to suggest the workings of Max's unusual mind, this is one of the most intimate movies in recent memory.
23226	3	a	It's a small movie about a small-time rodeo rider. But emotionally, it stands taller than any blockbuster about spandex-wearing superheroes or wisecracking space smugglers.
23227	5	a	Despite Jones' performance, it's a disappointing biopic
23228	5	a	for die-hard fans for whom there is no such thing as a poop gag taken too far and there can never, ever be too many Brokeback Mountain parodies
23229	1	a	An eerily quiet, bracingly bloody, and expertly laid-out adaptation of the Cormac McCarthy novel.
23230	9	a	Flat and uninspired.
23231	2	a	Fockers has the combined subtlety of a libido-mad bull elephant and a bad case of flatulence in church, but that's the kind of movie it is. 
23232	4	a	Both the best and worst thing about Russell's new film, I Heart Huckabees, is the way the filmmaker has completely bought into his own image.
23233	3	a	Nicolas Cage gives one of the best performances of his career in this borderline insane film...
23234	5	a	"If it bleeds, we can kill it"", Arnie said of the original monster. Perhaps it's finally time to finally put this bleeding, limping series out of its misery for good."
23235	3	a	Stage-to-screen adaptations are rarely this primal, and it's been a long time since a William Friedkin film has felt so vital.
23236	3	a	A deft treatment of its delicate subject material and some remarkable performances that give the film both touching, raw, authentic emotion and a certain kinetic humor.
23237	5	a	Much darker than the previous films, this third installment feels more like a horror flick set in amusement park than a good sci-fi adventure, though special effects, due to technology advances, are more sophisticated.
23238	3	a	An enchanting puzzle, not flashy, but fiendishly clever in the plotting and even more fiendish in the telling.
23239	5	a	The Darkest Minds boasts a decent cast and a fairly interesting premise centred on likeable characters. But its banality squashes any potential it had, resulting in a safe, forgettable sci-fi.
23240	6	a	Nothing more than Home Alone in an airport.
23241	3	a	Here's a badly acted movie with a terrific story line that makes it well worth seeing.
23242	4	a	A generally wholesome and entertaining confection. The animation is state-of-the-art, but the simple plot mechanics and often rather tired jokes could have benefited from some rewriting.
23243	6	a	Gives us few reasons not to stay to the ending, but the ultimate revelation of Blanco's pain ... disappoints.
23244	1	a	Tender and amazing.
23245	3	a	The best thing about Revolutionary Road... is that it doesn't end with that rote vision of bourgeois anomie. It only begins there.
23246	5	a	Crossover's got game, not to mention the best of intentions. But it's too clunky by half.
23247	9	a	What happened to James L. Brooks? 
23248	4	a	The Break-Up doesn't turn the rom-com on its head, but with its focus on the darker side of love manages to gently tip it on its side.
23249	6	a	Too much. Too numbing. Too coy. And ultimately too violent.
23250	4	a	No one should have to sit in a movie theater desperately waiting for the half-time buzzer.
23251	4	a	It will probably make buckets of money, but as this summer's action movie, Wild Wild West only gets mild.
23252	3	a	Weird and darkly comic.
23253	1	a	Director Weinstein evokesthe warmth of Brooklyn's Hasidic community while at the same time offering implicit criticism of its insularity.
23254	6	a	The animal side of the movie is great; the human side not so great.
23255	5	a	"The Last Witch Hunter"" aims for pulpy, comic-book fun, but it's never as fleet, funny, or detailed as it needs to be. If you're looking for something above middling in terms of plot, characters, [or] world-building, you'll need to seek it elsewhere."
23256	4	a	Hornet fans across generations will enjoy connecting this modern version to its pop-cultural roots stretching back more than seven decades, 
23257	10	a	The film reveals no great truths about human nature or drug abuse, the dialogue is witless, the acting unconstrained.
23258	2	a	An hilarious anti-Pixar parody with a filthy mind and a dirty mouth...A near-brilliant exercise in bad taste.
23259	3	a	In a change of pace, De Sica directed this three-act comedy, which won the Best Foreign Language Oscar, featuring charming performances from Sophia Loren and Marcello Mastroianni at their prime.
23260	1	a	A strong contender for one of the best films of the year.
23261	7	a	Simon Pegg is a funny man who can make any movie better with his performance, but not this one.
23262	6	a	Whatever Romero is trying to say this time is buried beneath a barrage of deafening gunfire and explosions.
23263	0	a	A spellbinding twisty story teeming with sexual frustration and whatnot.
23264	3	a	Easily one of the most unusual films in Eastwood's career, and one of the most unique films to come out of Hollywood all year.
23265	4	a	Almost every beat of Langston's tale, with its absent father figures and heated gun-pointing melodrama, rings false-hardly a fitting contemporary complement to the Greatest Story Ever Told.
23266	0	a	A sobering documentary which makes a convincing case that climate change is a national security issue. 
23267	4	a	Jean-Claude van Damme and Steven Seagal will be kicking themselves - or perhaps each other - for having turned Stallone down.
23268	5	a	A movie that means well but lacks the conviction and cultural awareness necessary for anything substantial.
23269	5	a	[The] fifth lap of the brainlessly macho series should please fans...while making everybody else wonder why.
23270	1	a	...both fair history and a edge-of-your-seat popcorn thriller, a good example of the best work of which Hollywood is capable.
23271	2	a	One possibility is that the main thing to recommend the film is nostalgia. But so be it.
23272	3	a	"While Damon doesn't have the benefit of surprising anyone with its sequel, ""The Bourne Supremacy,"" it proves just as enjoyable as its predecessor."
23273	5	a	Without Diesel, there's not much gas, at least not from the nonvehicular elements.
23274	9	a	Everyone connected with this gangsta opus was probably trying to make a crowd-pleaser. However, you wind up wondering what kind of crowds they were trying to please.
23275	4	a	By the standards of knucklehead swill, The Hot Chick is pretty damned funny.
23276	5	a	A poor man's version of a Judd Apatow-style raunchy romantic comedy.
23277	3	a	The characters are brought to vivid life with remarkably compelling performances by two of the screen's most versatile actors: Don Cheadle as the freewheeling Greene; and Chiwetel Ejiofor as Hughes, the aggressively ambitious executive.
23278	3	a	Stiller portrays a human accident better than anyone and he definitely knows how to extort laughs and sympathy from his audience
23279	6	a	This feels almost like a parody of Almodovar, with its melodramatic tone and themes of gender, identity, sex and revenge.
23280	1	a	Smart, hard-charging, compassionate.
23281	5	a	Coming from a studio and director who've repeatedly found new ways to reinvent the wheel, it's extra disappointing to see them release something so primitive.
23282	5	a	The main problem is that the social tapestry is far, far less interesting than in Far from Heaven.
23283	4	a	A fine example of budget filmmaking with this beautifully shot and thought provoking Sci-Fi tale of loss, isolation and loneliness ...
23284	1	a	There are conventions in this sort of story, and Russell seems to violate most of them. He allows the peculiarities of his characters to lead them away from the plot line and into perplexities of their own.
23285	5	a	Just because performers click romantically off-screen doesn't mean you need to pay good money to watch them in movies that are less interesting than the stories they inspire in supermarket tabloids.
23286	2	a	...husband-and-wife directing team Adam Ravetch and Sarah Robertson , who shot much of the footage over more than a decade in the Arctic, are aiming for a playful, casual, child-friendly tone...
23287	6	a	Like San Francisco, events sort of just happen and allegiances just sort of shift around to stall time before the grand finale.
23288	3	a	Takes an optimistic, undeniably sweet approach to issues of the heart, and doesn't lose its head in the process.
23289	4	a	A tame indie with sci-fi leanings that nearly gets by on Aubrey Plaza's unique charms.
23290	4	a	For a fairly typical romantic comedy, Hitch is a mildly entertaining diversion that ultimately becomes engulfed in its formulaic trappings.
23291	1	a	Haynes has forged a drama that's wonderfully intimate and subtle while generating considerable emotional power.
23292	6	a	A new spin on the original skit with some fresh stars like Sinbad and McKean plus a generous special effects budget fill in the gaps when the movie flags.
23293	5	a	Either you will find this cheaply made American independent docudrama charming or faintly irritating.
23294	6	a	Matthew McConaughey tries, and fails, to control the screen with swaggering machismo and over-the-top lunacy.
23295	1	a	Poignant, humanistic and irresistibly comic.
23296	4	a	I laughed here and there - not hard - but just enough to have to recommend the film.
23297	0	a	The story and the silent-era conventions may not be entirely original, but the director revives this uniquely American storytelling style with such infectious joy and life-affirming enthusiasm that it's nearly impossible not to respond in equal measure.
23298	4	a	A surprisingly tight heist movie that is much better than you expect. The solid cast of actors take you on a wild ride.
23299	3	a	Ralph Breaks the Internet remembers what excited many viewers about the first film on a visual level, but gives them a lot more substance and emotion to go along with their eye candy and pop culture references.
23300	7	a	In what must have felt like an Oscar bid at the time, Ryan struts with a hip-thrusting ferocity that would bounce small children into walls, all while doing some funny voice acting.
23301	7	a	With the tiniest bit of effort, Wrong Turn could have been a fun slasher flick, but no one involved seems to have cared about anything but a paycheck.
23302	0	a	Virtuoso. A film of pin-sharp principles, cross-hair precision and suffocating tension, this Coens stunner hits like a cattle gun between the eyes.
23303	6	a	Pretty much proffers everything you can want in a film based on the upstart company that brought porn to a computer screen near you. 
23304	0	a	This particular viewing experience is not like being on the edge of your seat, or laughing yourself silly, or being scared out of your wits. Benjamin Button washes over you in an almost hypnotic way. Call it cinematic mediation.
23305	3	a	If it's successful, Serenity will be taken as a singular achievement, one worth emulating for small screen auteurs and big screen marketing departments alike.
23306	7	a	Yawn. Another boring trip to Mars.
23307	5	a	Gets bogged down in bad dialogue, wasted acting and the most un-Saylesian thing of all, outright ignorance.
23308	4	a	Jackson plays the coach with wit and authority. His imposing presence ensures that he won't have to take much guff, even from the toughest punk on the team.
23309	6	a	Despite its bloated length and meandering plot, this is still an enjoyable production, at least for fans of Peter Jackson, Middle Earth and J.R.R. Tolkien.
23310	4	a	A flawed but entertaining thriller.
23311	6	a	...director Sofia Coppola does a laudable - but ultimately unsatisfying - job of presenting a ships-that-pass-in-the-night scenario...
23312	2	a	If and when you go see it, don't go in with an expectation of seeing something cinematically superior, but do expect a good time.
23313	0	a	Haynes elicits two great performances and provides the perfect frame for them, not just in terms of setting, but through smart casting and attention to the smallest of performances. Notice how even actors with one line grab one's attention.
23314	0	a	Working this time with her own story, Coppola lets it relax and breathe, devoting herself to moods and moments.
23315	4	a	Amounts to less than it should but still worth a jaunt.
23316	3	a	Without a doubt, a manipulative picture. But director Chris Columbus, schmaltzmeister that he is, makes no bones about it.
23317	3	a	Its scenes and sensibility are all more than familiar, but it exudes a kind of nostalgic spy-movie charm and, at the same time, is so fresh and free of the usual thriller nonsense that it all seems to be happening for the first time.
23318	1	a	"A Most Wanted Man"" is the rare film that will remain on your mind long after you've left the theater."
23319	1	a	click to read full article
23320	6	a	The film seethes with misdirected and unrecognized anger.
23321	6	a	A sweet, tidy and ultimately forgettable story.
23322	5	a	A romance featuring older characters shaped by bitter experience is rare, making it all the more frustrating that Hanks opts for juvenile gags about boobs and bums, and the occasional pratfall.
23323	2	a	Cate Blanchett really shines here as Mrs. Zimmerman, a witch with a tragic past who is broken inside, and her magic is suffering. You could easily watch the joyous insult banter between Blanchett and Black for two hours. 
23324	4	a	Gondry is an incredible visual stylist and he's showing off in a way that fits perfectly with the loose style of the movie.
23325	5	a	An object lesson in how not to use likable stars.
23326	4	a	Hoffman has an intimate feel for the drama, yet he strives to open it out for the big screen with too many lyrical montages, and this occasionally blunts the more intense exchanges.
23327	3	a	Proves again that Damon can elevate just about anything in which he appears.
23328	7	a	"Thomas Harris is now hoodwinked by his creation's faux pedigree. He's scripted him a ridiculously Eurotrashy upbringing, one so silly, it'll remind you of Dr. Evil's memory-tripping: ""Summers in Rangoon, luge lessons..."
23329	3	a	Tolkein geeks rejoice
23330	3	a	Fun, if you're inclined toward cynicism, contempt, nihilism and cool stuff like that.
23331	5	a	This adventure drama about a group trying to survive in the Gobi desert is filled with nothing but hot air.
23332	3	a	An accomplished film that's as entertaining as it is deliciously offbeat.
23333	9	a	By teasing us with potential meaning only to embrace wanton gunplay, Waist Deep betrays thinking members in the audience.
23334	4	a	Beneath the ham acting and the relentless banter is a serious movie about relationships. We're being sold laughs, but a few sober thoughts are delivered.
23335	6	a	The difference with Indiana Jones or Pirates of the Caribbean is that most of their action is memorable and filtered through a charismatic hero who fills in the downtime. The flat turns the story takes make it more The Adjustment Bureau meets Spaceballs.
23336	5	a	It unsuccessfully tries to bridge the gap between pathos and establishing a sense of realism, coming across as forced. Overweight prisoners and Harvey Keitel's German accent distract from the mood of the film.
23337	5	a	If this movie was a tree in Vermont, it'd have a tap driven into it and be sporting a bucket to catch the sap.
23338	3	a	Extremely enjoyable film, with a winning performance from Eminem -- essentially this is the Hip-Hop version of Rocky. In a good way.
23339	1	a	Jarmusch and Whitaker are masters at work proving once again that you don't need a huge budget to tell a meaningful story.
23340	3	a	The excitement of Jurassic Park is in Spielberg's sense of timing, with the scene of the kids trapped in a jeep watching a cup of water tremble now a classic moment of cinema.
23341	9	a	There are relatively few laughs -- unless you crave toilet humor -- in this direct-to-video-grade installment.
23342	3	a	Those early scenes in the Shire and the story of the loss of the dwarf kingdom establish character and purpose and give reason to hope and care that, like a talented sports team with a losing record, things can get only better.
23343	1	a	Stunning. ... Fanning gives such an authentic portrayal of a terror-stricken child that you might want to call Family Services on her behalf.
23344	5	a	...another Eastwood meditation on the ripple effect of violence.
23345	1	a	It's immensely satisfying, a divinely relaxed and confident film. Mr. Park and Mr. Lord brilliantly integrate everyday objects into the story.
23346	2	a	I don't know that I've ever seen a film in which the visual glory on the screen was so at odds with the philosophy evident in the screenplay.
23347	4	a	It's nowhere near as good as it's supposed to be.
23348	3	a	"A well-intentioned, white-perspective drama like ""Black or White"" isn't going to change the world, but it might change the terms of an overdue conversation."
23349	1	a	It's almost like Sergio Leone was adapting a Kenneth Grahame story.
23350	8	a	A more awesomely bleak portrait of town life is hard to conceive.
23351	3	a	I thoroughly enjoyed this film, never once felt bored during its two and a half hour runtime and was gripped by its many strong performances.
23352	6	a	Director Mike Figgis also composed the score, which during the tense scenes merely sounds like a two-year-old incessantly banging on random piano keys.
23353	6	a	While I wouldn't call it a terrible entry in the series, The Beginning is just a bit too dry, obvious and familiar to generate much enthusiasm.
23354	0	a	"Haynes is at his best when losing himself in the moment, isolating longing on a molecular level. ""Carol"" has an abundance of these beats, and each one works to reinforce what a special, profoundly felt movie it is."
23355	5	a	I don't think there is even one thing that happens that I didn't foresee. It's the sort of movie that makes dumb guys like me feel smart.
23356	1	a	A well-acted, realistic look at unemployed shipyard workers in northern Spain alternating humor with pathos.
23357	2	a	In spite of some fairly middling song writing and relatively average animation, if you're in the right frame of mind Rock Dog is actually rather a blast. 
23358	3	a	Americanized remake of Japanese horror smash is a smart, disturbing and striking horror movie.
23359	5	a	Like watching some favourite relative die, Stallone subjects the viewer to a miserable and pathetic end for such an enduring character.
23360	1	a	Outrageously funny and imaginative...the latest thumping thrill ride in the animation genre. A snappy and smart superhero saga that's intriguingly charming in its chaotic mode
23361	4	a	fantastic job setting up a very eerie, frightening and confusing story ... but the ending falls short of our greatest hopes
23362	4	a	A refreshing alternative to the hypertrophied spy thrillers in which exaggerated action sequences, over-the-top super-villainy and high-tech gadgetry trump character and plot.
23363	5	a	Slowly trudges through the motions of a tired whodunit, saving its dramatic juices for a blowout finale that never comes.
23364	5	a	The law of diminishing returns is in full effect here -- there are a couple of inspired gags but most fall embarrassingly flat.
23365	3	a	The action in Resident Evil is like watching demons from the repressed unconscious break loose and attack the ego.
23366	6	a	"While one can appreciate the film's rousing endorsement of our community college system, it's about as realistic as an episode of the TV sitcom ""Community."
23367	3	a	Co-directed by Lubitsch and George Cukor, ultimately this Oscar-nominated film bears the signature of the former, or what is known as the Lubitsch touch.
23368	9	a	It's the worst kind of bad film: the kind that gets you all worked up and then lets you down, instead of just being lousy from the first shot.
23369	1	a	Adams gives a great performance. Her sincerity is what makes it all work.
23370	4	a	presented with such enthusiastic abandon that it's easy to get caught up in the proceedings, no matter how far-fetched.
23371	3	a	It's a kind of parable, delivered in a manner that has nothing to do with preaching.
23372	4	a	Romantic folk tale retold with music and classic Streisand.
23373	4	a	Booze and jealousy make a toxic cocktail, one that's heavily imbibed with much self-lacerating gusto in the grim British drama The Edge of Love.
23374	4	a	After briefly catching comic lightning, the fun fades. Actor-screenwriter Simon Pegg and director-screenwriter Edgar Wright paint their characters into a pub corner.
23375	0	a	It is, in short, the best of cinema.
23376	1	a	No es una cinta de guerra heroica, sino todo lo contrario, y esto de refleja perfectamente en la escena final, que es de una incredulidad indescriptible.
23377	1	a	Steve Zaillian's script trims some the novel's fat, keeping the film a lean, mean and frightening beast.
23378	3	a	I don't know how non-believers will react to this, but for me it was an affirmation and strengthening of my faith.
23379	1	a	A gripping glorification of what real leadership is all about.
23380	3	a	There's an emotional truth to TGNW that can be denied or ignored, and it comes through if you give the movie a chance.
23381	5	a	Not as bad as the title might suggest, maybe a bit too dark a comedy for most audiences. However, it still has some comedic blank spots.
23382	2	a	In this fun musical, Betty Hutton gives perhaps an overenergetic peformance in a part that was intended for Judy Garland before she was fired.
23383	6	a	That the cast includes Helen Mirren, Joe Pesci and Gina Gershon ought to provide redemption, but the script fails to persuade me this story needed to be told.
23384	4	a	Spade's version of 'The Wedding Singer'--a movie that might actually appeal to people who've previously found its star insufferable...a good-natured bit of family fluff.
23385	4	a	It's glossy and entirely forgettable, but the friendly, funny cast makes it worth seeing.
23386	3	a	The film breezes by in what feels like an instant, the emotional warmth exuded by the relationships within both genuine and true.
23387	4	a	We Bought a Zoo won't change your life, but it will provide two hours of lovely, slightly whimsical escapism.
23388	6	a	For a movie about finding one's identity, Rango spends an awful lot of time searching for one of its own.
23389	8	a	Is pretty thin and uninspired outside of one or two modestly clever gags.
23390	4	a	Bee Movie is a light, moderately entertaining romp. Not that there's anything wrong with that.
23391	6	a	The lead, Ileana Douglas, is good, but the musical film suffers from repetitive structure and lack of sufficiently interesting ideas.
23392	5	a	This simply doesn't have the right stuff.
23393	9	a	To see Johnny Depp and Angelina Jolie in The Tourist is like watching a chemistry experiment gone horribly wrong.
23394	3	a	It's well cast and generally much more sincere than sentimental.
23395	10	a	Bride Of Chucky, the fourth film in the Child's Play series, plays like an unfunny and corny parody of the first three films.
23396	4	a	The screenplay is so scrupulous, so fair, so enlightened and so intelligent that real people have trouble shouldering it aside so that they can share messy human emotions. Nothing is ever quite this neat. 
23397	3	a	...a sumptuous elegy.
23398	4	a	The movie is crisp and quick and looks as if it were shot yesterday, but for all that, Soul Power is ultimately disappointing.
23399	4	a	There are mountain tunes as powerful as moonshine to be enjoyed in Songcatcher.
23400	3	a	Groundbreaking [and] visually breathtaking.
23401	4	a	You could do a whole lot worse if you're looking through generic science fiction or disaster movies, but Steven Spielberg's standards are usually much higher than this.
23402	3	a	Serenity is swash buckling good fun. It smartly understands that its audience wants a mix of corny belly-laughs and hard-core comic book style violence.
23403	3	a	Coppola shows genuine interest in emotional detail, and it accumulates into a depth of real feeling.
23404	1	a	It'll take two and a half hours of your life and still make you feel younger.
23405	1	a	The compassion and humor in the script makes it one of the year's best.
23406	6	a	...the writer and director, Peter Jackson, could not decide what kind of movie he wanted to make...
23407	4	a	Mara's bristling, unbridled performance gives the film the ballast it needs to pull off that curious, undeniably engrossing, balancing act.
23408	3	a	A tad overrated, but still charming.
23409	4	a	The match itself is great fun, and a fine voice cast includes Timothy Spall, Tom Hiddleston and Maisie Williams. But Early Man sags a little in the middle, and isn't quite as funny as it needs to be.
23410	5	a	Brrrrrr....As scary as a ride though the Coney Island funhouse.
23411	6	a	The film creates authentic tension out of unanswered questions, and that works until you realize that none of the questions will be answered, and that is a frustrating disappointment.
23412	1	a	It's a movie, yes. But this stirring account of the fight to end racially motivated voting impediments in the Deep South is more than anything a much-needed wake-up call for a country that has seriously lost its way in terms of equality. 
23413	9	a	A kitchen sink comedy more shocking than funny and strictly recommended for rabid fans of the bottom-feeding franchise.
23414	3	a	Ben Stiller proves his acting chops in this atypical role as a heroin-addicted television writer.
23415	1	a	The dangerous line that Monster treads is between explaining monstrosity and excusing it.
23416	3	a	Heartwarming holiday fare that even jaded adults can share with the kids.
23417	4	a	"while ""Taking Woodstock"" is a bit of a shaggy dog story, Lee uses a subtle build to show how 'three days of peace, love and music' transformed a rural farming community."
23418	6	a	Although ambitious in its lyrical presentation, filmmaker Joe Wright's The Soloist plays a stale tune of cliched melancholy musical chairs.
23419	6	a	Although one cannot question the quality of performances here, with Glenn Close Mia Wasikowska, and Janet McTeer leading the way, Albert Nobbs suffers for lack of breadth and vision. 
23420	5	a	There's nothing here that Disney hasn't done much better decades ago, and the script is a lame mixture of slapstick and sentiment.
23421	1	a	This isn't an examination of the Scottish drug culture from the outside looking in, it's one from the inside looking out.
23422	2	a	James is a gleeful crackup opposite Smith.
23423	3	a	A classy if over-caffeinated sequel.
23424	0	a	The film makes a defense of erudition as another pleasure of life, comparable to the discovery of sexuality and the first love that moves its main story. [Full review in Spanish]
23425	3	a	...more clever and kinetic than it is profound, more a visceral movie than a think piece.
23426	4	a	...Coppola's more interested in establishing the mood of this foreign land, instead of allowing us to really get to know the two central characters.
23427	0	a	There is really no way to describe the playfulness and exquisite timing of the comedy in this film. It is partially Herzog's zany artistry, and partly Cage's masterful control of facial expressions and comic timing.
23428	2	a	Has plenty of quips.
23429	8	a	After paying good money to take your family to see this film, you may be dealing with some anger-management issues of your own.
23430	3	a	A richly complex film that is a treat for the eyes, the mind and the funny bone of those young and old.
23431	8	a	This is not just a 'B-movie' -- it's a B-movie that fails to entertain on any level.
23432	6	a	Predictably unconventional, indulgently metafictional, and hesitant about going for its alluded intentions.
23433	3	a	downbeat, stylish and strange film
23434	2	a	"Weinstein normally directs documentaries, and ""Menashe"" has a fly-on-the-wall feel at times, particularly in the warmly believable interplay between father and son. The movie was filmed in Borough Park, N.Y., which adds to the atmosphere."
23435	9	a	A zombie movie in every sense of the word--mindless, lifeless, meandering, loud, painful, obnoxious.
23436	5	a	A shameless apologia for the Confederacy as a divinely inspired crusade for faith, home and slave labor.
23437	4	a	Fun, four-legged scampering isn't enough when the characters are so unmemorable, the high concept is so wobbly and the journey doesn't have you rooting for a reunion.
23438	3	a	You don't need an interpreter to get that this a good movie.
23439	6	a	I think we're pretty much done here.
23440	6	a	There's too much people and not enough dog in Lawrence Kasdan's Darling Companion, and even if you prefer people to dogs, that's a serious problem.
23441	4	a	Everything is big about the Civil War epic Gods and Generals -- except its emotional impact.
23442	4	a	The first half, which is vintage Hitchcock, is by far superior to the second half, which is pure Steven Seagal.
23443	2	a	The Ring trades run-of-the-mill revulsion for extreme unease, starting with the mysterious video itself -- a montage of stark, black-and-white grotesqueries and symbolic objects.
23444	5	a	Plodding sci-fi dragon disaster tale is OK for older kids.
23445	1	a	"While predictable, the film makes up for it in all the right ways - this comedy rivals any of its ""bromance"" predecessors."
23446	1	a	I literally found myself gasping for breath during Meet the Parents' most comic moments, wishing I could rewind the film.
23447	6	a	Mediocre, but watchable.
23448	3	a	Hancock is the sort of Fourth of July cinematic fireworks celebration Hollywood dreams about but rarely achieves.
23449	4	a	...As fleeting and insubstantial as a snowflake, and about as much fun.
23450	2	a	An instant classic for the high school teen romantic comedy genre. Funny, charming and impactful. [Full review in Spanish]
23451	4	a	Portman and Johansson are phenomenal alone and together.
23452	3	a	A lot of critics are claiming this to be the best Bond film ever made; they may well be right-to some degree. It's certainly the most poignant-which, in what is ostensibly an action film, is a feather in Mendes' cap to be sure. 
23453	4	a	Even with the movie's multiple personas, its message -- that salvation sometimes doesn't arrive in the expected form, and that escaping isn't the same thing as running away -- is delivered loud and clear.
23454	1	a	Deliver Us From Evil has a few things wrong with it, including an egregious musical score, but without resorting to sucker punches, it takes your breath away while making your skin crawl.
23455	6	a	Heartless. That's the one word that best describes Cube, a brutal and nasty attempt to explore human motivations and emotions at their most basic level.
23456	7	a	Hereafter tries to do what Crash did but without the superficial gloss, the charm or actors who can actually act. The result is desperately, eye-achingly drab. 
23457	6	a	Lessons for life, suitable for the Disney Channel and inspiration for people who love fairy tales ... a favorite of people who love sentiment and melodrama.
23458	5	a	Nicholson is on autopilot, and Brooks doesn't give the characters the full three dimensions to complement the script's undeniably witty lines.
23459	9	a	For the DVD special edition, they might consider removing everything but the races and chases, including its Smokey and the Bandit scramble; fast-forwarding may be just too much effort.
23460	2	a	It's a sweet movie...one of the best things about the movie is that it looks incredible.
23461	3	a	It's no great shakes as a film, but its combination of mild comedy, slapstick, pathos, many photogenic canines and a positive message will make it irresistible to families.
23462	4	a	"Stephen Dorff is suitably intimidating as the film's scoundrel... ""Hand that Rocks the Cradle"" meets ""Fatal Attraction"" "
23463	3	a	A clever movie with a smart message, 'Diary of a Wimpy Kid' far surpasses its dopey-looking ad campaign.
23464	6	a	...a facile, undemanding romantic comedy elevated from formula dreck by the considerable charisma of Will Smith
23465	7	a	An animated corpse of a film about a reanimated one.
23466	3	a	Only first-time visitors to Paris are in for disappointment: it simply can't live up to this.
23467	2	a	If you can look past Lazenby in the title role, the story line, action, and supporting cast are well above average.
23468	2	a	Come to the theater prepared, with a handkerchief in one hand and a rotten tomato in the other.
23469	6	a	An interesting idea, but it falls a bit short of being a compelling story.
23470	6	a	Loud, noisy, chaotic and overall unpleasant.
23471	4	a	The Infiltrator has some great moments of tension and suspense. What's unfortunate is that those great moments are few and far between. 
23472	4	a	If there is such a thing as the postmodern relationship ... then director Charles Shyer has come maddeningly close to objectifying it with 'Alfie.' 
23473	0	a	A devastating first feature ...
23474	1	a	Visually alluring in its exquisitely stylish execution, Yimou's House of Flying Daggers is a riveting epic that soars beyond the boundless imagination.
23475	6	a	The default middle ground between true-to-life and wacky in I Give It A Year turns out to be a place of dreary artificiality.
23476	3	a	Imagine if Borat had been made by Miranda July, the whimsical beat-poet performance artist who gave us Me and You and Everyone We Know.
23477	4	a	"Any film whose biggest concern is, ""Did the future Queen of England kiss a bloke that night?"" is obviously not for everyone. But if the war, the royals, or period frocks are your game, this could be the right sweet confection for you."
23478	6	a	Costner's never been better than he is here. But Binder's...wrapped his film in cloying Hallmark sentiment with a cutesy score that undermines much of what he's trying to achieve.
23479	4	a	Mother and Child has what might be the first Oscar caliber performance of the year. 
23480	3	a	It's good to know that, in the future, we can still thaw out a cryogenically-preserved Will Smith to save the world every July.
23481	5	a	Mr. Godard is a bold experimenter, but it's time he picked himself a stronger theme.
23482	3	a	Aniston rises to the level of the material, creating a character of remarkable breadth and depth.
23483	3	a	...brilliant and cold, like a sun-flooded winter's day.
23484	8	a	The dialogue is stilted, none of the situations seem believable, and most of the jokes are stale. 
23485	6	a	An air of contrivance and, worse, fraudulence, hangs over this gentle fantasy, despite some charming moments.
23486	0	a	It's all about McDormand - truly a performer you can build a whole film around, and one who can whisk a scene away from even her most seasoned peers.
23487	4	a	...a passable yet predominantly forgettable piece of work.
23488	3	a	... lots of knowing laughs along the way ... 
23489	4	a	For a low-brow, psycho-on-the-loose-in-paradise thriller, A Perfect Getaway is surprisingly entertaining, with exactly the right elements to overcome the inevitable cliches.
23490	0	a	Religion is always a delicate and personal issue, but great filmmaking is great filmmaking, period.
23491	5	a	By thrusting the story about women who pass themselves off as men in nineteenth-century England into close-up, this film version accentuates its implausibility to fatal effect. 
23492	1	a	There's not much plot, depth or character development, but it more than makes up for it in relentless intensity and consistency of vision.
23493	6	a	Will probably matter only slightly to Shore's fans, but this patchy film will hardly deliver Shore the crossover breakout he so sorely desires nor the admiration due a talented film auteur.
23494	0	a	At the heart of the film is a star-making performance by the handsome Welsh actor Christian Bale.
23495	7	a	Strictly a vanity vehicle with a mess of star babies on board.
23496	0	a	My oh my, is this an invigorating, electric movie.
23497	0	a	proposes a fierce universe, but one where things happen for a reason, and in this it is as profoundly comforting as it is overwhelmingly lyrical
23498	0	a	The Artist makes a strong argument for film as an escape from the modern escapist fantasies. It doesn't mean anything - that's what some critics are crying now - but since when did we decide that movies always have to have meaning? 
23499	4	a	A highly memorable, very touching fantasy
23500	4	a	Depending on your tolerance for such films, it'll either be easy or difficult to accept this unabashedly absurd story.
23501	1	a	Don't let this slip by you.
23502	6	a	Manufactures sparks when none are naturally forthcoming.
23503	4	a	Inherent Vice has a dazzling and often entertaining atmosphere of debasement, like a smiley face rotting from the inside. Yet there's a real limit to its pleasure. 
23504	3	a	Justifies its existence by improving on Niels Arden Oplev's serviceable but unspectacular Swedish predecessor, though it can't overcome the flaws of the original book.
23505	1	a	A deeply moving film that extends beyond Bergman's experiences and speaks to the importance of emotional connections among human beings.
23506	3	a	Chan and Wilson make a great comic team.
23507	1	a	"Like a rodeo man clinging on for dear life, ""The Rider"" is a tough film to shake, even well after you've experienced the ride. "
23508	7	a	This cluttered, busy but dispiriting family movie is like an extravagant cinematic fun house equipped with everything money can buy, except the fun. 
23509	1	a	Moves with the speed of a freight train.
23510	9	a	There are also scenes, the disjointed kind that wander off aimlessly in the vague hope of finding a movie, not to mention a laugh.
23511	9	a	Not even Owen Wilson's potent slacker charm can save it from a fatal lack of any sort of momentum, much less energy, leaving it with the sort of stasis that sucks all the fun right out of the proceedings
23512	4	a	The exotic setting and characters deserve more riveting situations than this imperfect Getaway gives them.
23513	5	a	There is nothing to be frightened of here.
23514	2	a	A frothy and deliriously enjoyable souffle.
23515	5	a	This is one film that won't appeal to either sports or comedy fans.
23516	5	a	It's possibly the most brainless film of the year. Until the third Transformers film surfaces, that is.
23517	7	a	[Pierre] Boulanger joins Keisha Castle-Hughes of Whale Rider as one of this year's strongest juvenile performers.
23518	6	a	Larry Crowne makes losing your job, your car and your house look like the greatest thing to happen to a middle aged man.
23519	3	a	How can you call Carol chilly when it's literally the thawing of cinema's inglorious past?
23520	9	a	A waste of a great director's time.
23521	6	a	Bland, generic and showing every sign of having been market-tested to death.
23522	4	a	It's high old fun, though it plays as a bit too much of a rehash of Pegg and Wright's Shaun of the Dead.
23523	10	a	Another lousy movie adapted from Stephen King's writing; another slander against the mentally ill; another energetic Depp performance in a losing cause.
23524	3	a	What a pleasure. After a cackle of serious dramas and actual letter grade B movies, this silly insect film was just the ticket to put a little honey in my tea.
23525	1	a	Breathes fresh life into the genre.
23526	4	a	Perhaps greatness was never in the cards for the production, but it manages to stand on its own two feet, with a mournful atmosphere that's nicely handled by the cast and crew, who try to make sense of an impossible creative situation.
23527	4	a	There's an adequate conclusion waiting for viewers willing to work through a movie they've seen before, though Haley throttles repetition with some welcome screen energy and a love for the genre.
23528	5	a	Director John Singleton seems to have finally found his niche: meaningless movies full of girls in tiny outfits and boys in tiny cars.
23529	6	a	The film shows no interest in the inner workings of a relationship that's defined by unusual circumstances. 
23530	5	a	The Wayans Brothers' homage to Bugs Bunny cartoon character Baby Face Finster isn't for most people with a brain. But for those who like this sort of thing -- sexual and bathroom humour and plenty of slapstick -- they'll like this.
23531	4	a	Vincent Gallo's ego gets the better of his storytelling in his acting-directing-writing debut, but there are flashes of genuis that make it worth watching.
23532	3	a	A sterling example of noir thriller efficiency.
23533	2	a	It's a well-crafted, good-looking film, and I love the names involved ... it's just not exciting enough.
23534	6	a	Maybe we should start having robots write movie scripts.
23535	1	a	Heartbreaking but ruthlessly honest, a mirror held up to contemporary life.
23536	3	a	Em's lowdown, dirty diatribe may sound like treason, but you might discover that his rhyme is the reason.
23537	0	a	This should be required viewing for today's droves of would-be memoirsts in film or any other medium, and otherwise is simply a must for anybody who likes great movies.
23538	3	a	Totally undeserving of its status as a punchline, this may be no classic but it's a fine kiddie tale
23539	3	a	A genre-less, imaginative riff by an intelligent filmmaker on the state of the country.
23540	3	a	This film is intelligent and beautifully acted. It's a movie about a group of people searching for a lost dog for days, and I never once looked at my watch.
23541	2	a	Just the right amount of creepy atmosphere, nervous laughter, cheap scares, fun rides and blood and guts to satisfy any major fan of the macabre.
23542	7	a	A heartfelt but contrived and simplistic take on the subject [of race relations].
23543	3	a	The Bourne Supremacy... shares the attributes of its star, Matt Damon: Solid, down-to-earth, good-looking but not too flashy, and often capable of surprising you.
23544	4	a	Within spitting distance of good...lesser than the sum of its parts due to deficits of ambition, invention and commitment.
23545	3	a	I can't figure out why, but it didn't really stick with me once I left the theater. It's very good, but not transcendent.
23546	4	a	Does everyone fall in love after the third date? In his world, they do.
23547	3	a	Typical Kevin Smith fare; not suitable for kids.
23548	4	a	It's the kind of foodie filth one dreams up while chomping on Doritos and Twinkies during a psychedelic haze.
23549	3	a	It's an uncompromising film, necessarily episodic in its depiction of the group's quest for survival, but mesmerizingly involving.
23550	0	a	"Dancer in the Dark"" is an exciting and daring experiment in musical filmmaking."
23551	6	a	A scattered comedy-drama with few laughs and even fewer insights.
23552	5	a	What either of the main characters think, or feel, about anything not directly related to their career ambitions remains wholly unexplored.
23553	5	a	Subtlety and nuance take a summer vacation.
23554	5	a	Madonna's noticeably weak, strained and unconvincing.
23555	3	a	Field of Dreams for tweens.
23556	2	a	It looks great, and it's bright and colorful, fast and fun, with terrific voice talent... You may know from the opening where the story's heading, but it's a fun ride, and there's a lot of heart between the laughs.
23557	6	a	When Vardalos tries to pass one-joke stereotypes and situations as revelatory characterizations and experiences, it simply doesn't achieve anything noteworthy.
23558	3	a	Though Kiss Me, Stupid has the structure and comic beats of a classic bedroom farce, it's an overwhelmingly cynical assessment of male jealousy and exploitation.
23559	2	a	While the pace of the film is slow, the colorful characters, witty dialog, movie references and beautiful artwork make this a pony ride worth taking.
23560	3	a	...The Ring is far scarier than any of the recent so-called horror flicks to hit theaters...
23561	3	a	The film is a cry of rage against the polluters and corrupters who, Schrader contends, are destroying the planet, as well as against the commercialisation of the churches and the growth of terrorism.
23562	4	a	This often entertaining film feels like a mish-mash of overfamiliar elements, falling way short in the wild, weird, what-the-f----was-that department.
23563	4	a	Secondhand Lions doesn't have to do much to win us over.
23564	5	a	Unfortunately the child actors aren't particularly engaging, and the gags aren't entirely fresh.
23565	4	a	Eventually the film strangles on its own conventions.
23566	4	a	Lawrence's bold performance and her fearlessly sexual character are more than Russell knows how to harness.
23567	3	a	There's poignant drama in this brash, sometimes overstated film, and Muriel's transformation is truly touching.
23568	4	a	Ultimately, Into the Blue isn't nearly as bad as it looks.
23569	5	a	It's hokey as hell, but The Crazies director Breck Eisner plays it like a video game and keeps the teen fan-boy market onside by ensuring that you can't throw a rune stone without hitting a member of the LOTR/Game of Thrones/Dark Knight cast.
23570	1	a	Theron's attitude, her walk, her body language are totally different from anything she's done before... [this is] an acting tour-de-force.
23571	7	a	It's just another formulaic fright flick.
23572	3	a	Ralph Breaks the Internet, while having the slight whiff of corporate obligation around it, is an entertaining, delightful, and heartwarming follow-up.
23573	7	a	A stunningly witless revival of the infamous British film series about a girls' boarding school.
23574	4	a	It's style over substance in this explosive, shoot 'em up that tries to make up with fast pace and visceral atmosphere what it lacks in characterization and coherence.
23575	0	a	I have never seen a more anti-Communist movie. The horrors of this ideology were everywhere.
23576	3	a	A giddy, freewheeling, clever, delightful animated romp 'about nothing,' a thing onto itself, the very definition of existential phenomenon.
23577	4	a	The entire cast did a phenomenal job, resisting the urge to overact too much, which is what you get for a film like this. 
23578	0	a	Devastating.
23579	5	a	"The Dressmaker"" wants to be a saucy and absurd tale of small town scandal, only to then attempt to try and turn the story completely inside out."
23580	7	a	How much more fulfilling it would have been to spend those hundred-odd minutes chasing a squirrel, taking a nap or disemboweling a stuffed animal on the living room rug.
23581	0	a	John Ford may be the first director to make me like John Wayne.
23582	2	a	"This coming-of-age story can seem like a series of ""Far Side"" panels expanded into a feature, but it imparts its lessons with a wealth of detail and too many gags to catch in one viewing."
23583	8	a	What we have here is a failure of craft. [MacFarlane] can't direct action, or even handle scenery well.
23584	3	a	Overall, Arctic Tale's one true message is clear: Stop global warming before it's too late.
23585	4	a	This is a sad, sweet little film; well acted, and capable of striking a universal chord. After all, who doesn't use some level of impersonation in order to get by?
23586	3	a	Marsh's poignant film showcases the best and worst instincts of human nature and tells an extraordinary tale.
23587	3	a	You won't believe your eyes.
23588	2	a	Director Simon West seems to confuse visual stylishness with emotional resonance, moody lighting with genuinely malevolent atmosphere, and sanctimonious lip service with genuine concern.
23589	1	a	In its expansive spirit of investigation and embrace of life as a creative act, Into the Wild comes as close as any picture ever made to capturing the America that Jack Kerouac discovered half a century ago.
23590	4	a	A perfectly respectable effort, but with all the talent involved it could have been better.
23591	7	a	It was too crudely done to have much effect as satire.
23592	7	a	"Glazer, a Murray confidante who most notably worked with him on ""Scrooged"", must secretly hate his friend for putting him through this mess. "
23593	7	a	Fanboys doesn't delve into the mania of fandom, it exploits it.
23594	6	a	A cluttered mishmash of conflicting styles and times.
23595	5	a	As used by Zemeckis, 'performance capture' technology turns actors into inferior simulacra of themselves. The effect of this 'realism' is not just creepy but kitschy -- and even ugly when placed in this story's anti-woman context...
23596	3	a	A post-pubescent Paper Moon with a hell of a hair-pin twist...Ridley Scott is surprisingly deft with comedy.
23597	6	a	I was propelled from scene to scene during Three Billboards, even as I found each of them to be annoyingly imperfect: blueprints for better versions of themselves, if given another draft or pass, some more time and care.
23598	3	a	Uneven though this horror film from Guillermo del Toro is, this haunted mansion is worth a visit. 
23599	4	a	A feel-good comedy about a slacker buddy who turns out to go way beyond his obligations as a best man. 
23600	2	a	A creepy and daring look into one of the most destructive, and self-destructive of American anti-heroes
23601	3	a	There is nothing unique about the film itself - except for the mesmerizing performance by Benedict Cumberbatch in the lead role.
23602	3	a	Apart from looking like no other type of animated film, Chicken Run stands alone in its unwavering determination not to play down to the kiddies.
23603	4	a	Tolkien's brisk story of intrepid little hobbit Bilbo Baggins is drawn out and diluted by dispensable trimmings better left for DVD extras.
23604	2	a	Not a perfect film, but it provides enough excitement and intrigue to keep the popcorn crowds well entertained and glued to their seats for future Bourne adventures.
23605	0	a	There is real magic afoot in Lost in Translation -- the sort that is created not at the wave of a wizard's wand, but by the coming together of two wayward souls.
23606	4	a	It does astounding work animating the mind of its young soldier, but it runs into technical difficulties whenever it tries to grasp the bigger picture.
23607	3	a	Apatow's ability to wring laughs both large and small out of ordinary situations is enviable.
23608	0	a	A movie which earns high marks simply for being the first feature film with the guts to tackle the subject of racial profiling in such an honest fashion, especially given the similar allegations recently leveled at the neighboring town of Tenaha.
23609	1	a	Thoroughly gripping.
23610	6	a	A routine remake of a superior film from an earlier era always prompts the question: Why bother?
23611	6	a	Fluffy and disposible.
23612	4	a	It's absolutely flawed and misses out on its full potential, but functions thanks to at least finding focus when doling out the facts and showing what went on throughout the investigation
23613	1	a	One of those rare movies that earns its feel-good ending without turning a blind eye to the compromises and little sorrows of everyday life.
23614	3	a	Almost good enough to make you forget its director is an overrated egomaniac and its star is a self-righteous nut.
23615	0	a	To broaden the commercial appeal of House of Flying Daggers, Zhang avoids political or other specifically Chinese issues and emphasizes the lavish spectacle. 
23616	0	a	Movie magic aplenty in animated action adventure from Disney.
23617	6	a	Star Trek at its geekiest, and cursory filmmaking at its blandest.
23618	5	a	The movie plays just like the rush job it is.
23619	6	a	Hancock is a mess that isn't even fun to enjoy for its little pleasures.
23620	1	a	It's the measured performances by co-stars Cate Blanchett and Rooney Mara that make this film special.
23621	6	a	"Veronica Mars"" isn't really a movie but another episode -- and not even a grand finale -- with all the familiar characters and in-jokes that viewers expect."
23622	4	a	A potentially risible idea is handled in satisfactory fashion.
23623	9	a	Get On Up is the Hollywood biopic at its near-worst -- a formless, extravagant assortment of historical incidents and lip-synched musical numbers ...
23624	4	a	You won't get wasted, but your money won't wither.
23625	4	a	Tall handsome actor seeking willing audience...
23626	3	a	Much as with LotR, the casting is a strength.
23627	4	a	True, there's only the merest suggestion of an education system for these juveniles, but credibility's secondary when you've got lots of dogs doing cute stuff.
23628	6	a	The result is a case study in why getting things right isn't necessarily the right way to make a movie. Facts can be really dull. And pro actors are more compelling than real people can ever be.
23629	4	a	Smarter in its message than its execution, this is still a thought-provoking rental.
23630	0	a	Call Me by Your Name is a movie about two people falling in love. It's the kind of movie that's deceptively simple, but one that lingers. In other words, it's the best kind of movie.
23631	3	a	Pulses with the star power of the extraordinary Javier Bardem.
23632	2	a	A movie with a moral and a message that is still entertaining
23633	2	a	The film balances the extraordinary and ordinary with great aplomb, and Duplass and Plaza give beautifully judged performances. 
23634	3	a	The magnetic chemistry of the actors ... elevates the story's familiar rhythms above leagues of imitators.
23635	2	a	Rogen and Goldberg start with spoofery and work their way into something bolder and stranger; it's as if playing in the Pixar sandbox, or a reasonable approximation thereof, can't help but inspire creativity.
23636	9	a	Only natural spitfire Spacek, as the pickup-driving mom of the land, feels fresh.
23637	9	a	The relentless upbeatness of Life or Something Like It wrecks the possibility of either real laughter or genuine pathos.
23638	3	a	an intelligent thriller - a nice surprise
23639	3	a	Another gem from director Sam Mendes about suburbanites who lead lives of quiet desperation.
23640	2	a	If it doesn't live up to its illustrious predecessors...well, it still has Connery, and that's a plus in anybody's book. 
23641	2	a	This is a warm movie told in the temperature of almost-recognizable life; it's a believable love story, joked up a bit but not too much.
23642	0	a	There are people who can resist lines like, 'He forced my little girl to listen to original Broadway cast albums while he had his way with her,' but I am not one of those people. 
23643	6	a	Revolutionary Road hits theaters at the height of Oscar season. That doesn't mean it's Oscar worthy.
23644	0	a	The Skin I Live In is a definite must-see, as all its elements harmoniously blend to create a cinematic masterpiece that stands out not just this year, but over the course of the past decade.
23645	1	a	A return to glory for the Coen Brothers, a revisiting of the formula that worked so well for them in Fargo, but with a darker, more cynical twist.
23646	3	a	Angry Birds is -- really sorry about this one -- a hoot.
23647	1	a	'Whiskey Tango Foxtrot' proves that Tina Fey has serious acting chops. 
23648	1	a	The film leaves an indelible impression of what it is like to have to slip into shadows, away from windows and mirrors, to experience true passion.
23649	3	a	It's tough work giving good face to an iconic role, yet Johansson manages to show Leigh as a thoughtful professional aware of the interpersonal booby-traps set by her director for his leading ladies.
23650	2	a	Roll Bounce has plenty of affectionate humor to balance some serious heart-tugging. And as for the roller-skating, it for sure provides a lot of razzle-dazzle action with lots of virtuoso terpsichorean touches.
23651	3	a	I may be one of the few who prefers the original Swedish TV version, but Fincher does a nice job of staying faithful to the Larsson novel and infusing it with his own sense of style.
23652	6	a	This group project produces no voice of its own, just faintly entertaining echoes of better movies and television shows.
23653	9	a	The filmmakers aim their cynicism more at us than at any government or drug company.
23654	4	a	Even when Lindsay Lohan's not in a movie she can still screw it up.
23655	5	a	Gleefully plunges through the silliness with remarkable conviction; there's a thrill to be had. Time and money are rarely wasted in such entertaining and inoffensive ways.
23656	8	a	Almost entirely reliant on star Bill Murray to crank up his cocktail-hour charms and save the day while the production slumps from one scene to the next. 
23657	3	a	As Leslie Cockburn's camera roams the foreclosed rowhouses of Baltimore, their planked-up doors reminiscent of shots from The Wire, I thought: Baltimore needs some good PR.
23658	5	a	Shapeless buddy-action junk.
23659	3	a	An authentic festival that requires nothing more than knowing what a joke is to make you die laughing. [Full Review in Spanish]
23660	5	a	This is the worst movie Wilson has made since he graduated from being Jackie Chan's punch line.
23661	3	a	It's an opulent odyssey that balances romance, comedy and thrills in one glittering and constantly surprising package.
23662	3	a	You can argue that prequels to great films simply shouldn't be made. But when they are, this is the right way to do it.
23663	1	a	The Coens load the film with realistic touches that add grit and meaning to the almost mythical plot.
23664	3	a	'The Curious Case of Benjamin Button' is elegant, well structured, and well acted by the entire cast from Pitt, Cate Blanchett, and Taraji P. Henson.
23665	4	a	Happy to distract the viewer with chase sequences and extended invasion showdowns, also using Danning's sex bomb appeal to keep attention away from the budgetary limitations. Why pay for explosions when there's spandex?
23666	9	a	A nauseating bowl of treacle about a man who discovers heaven in his own backyard.
23667	7	a	How Do You Know is a terrible title for a not-much-better movie, missing a question mark and most of the point with romantic comedies. James L. Brooks' film is rarely romantic and barely amusing, dashing any hope that Spanglish was just a fluke.
23668	4	a	It manages to squeeze by on Angelina Jolie's surprising flair for self-deprecating comedy.
23669	9	a	It's the two Coreys at the height of their popularity; make sure your children avert their eyes... by gouging them out if necessary.
23670	2	a	It is a moving and well-meaning film that never quite manages the greatness one expects, given its soaring subject material.
23671	6	a	[It] has a fine cast, but doesn't seem to have much to say other than lamenting the unfairness of getting old.
23672	4	a	It's now all strictly about the elaborate kills, and the associated red herrings. If you know and dig this, you'll have a blast.
23673	6	a	A build-up of secrecy and anxiety are well-served by Van Sant's chopped-up narrative of the slow reveal, and again the director shows a keen eye for the rituals and worries of teenage life.
23674	0	a	The Coen Brothers have gotten their mojo back with the help of Cormac McCarthy.
23675	3	a	In his debut, Jandreau's soft, understated performance gives him the presence of a screen veteran.
23676	5	a	Absolutely implausible, silly and thin. A shame for Robert Redford...and one more Moore's bad film.
23677	2	a	Rarely has the term 'Hollywood ending' been quite as appropriate, and seldom has a denouement of that nature come so close to tainting all that came before.
23678	8	a	Any movie top-billed by a star as hot as Johnny Depp that somehow manages to sit on a shelf for more than a year after its completion is bound to be a stinker.
23679	0	a	Writer-director David O. Russell keeps the audience guessing. He takes unexpected twists and turns as if defying you to guess what will come next.
23680	4	a	It's worth a look. But overall, Hook feels like an exercise in cynicism.
23681	8	a	The movie is a creepy, unpleasant experience, made all the worse because it stars children too young to understand the horrible things we see them doing.
23682	9	a	Country Strong is dead on arrival.
23683	4	a	Self-discovery seems to be the goal, but the revelations hardly seem worth the work.
23684	3	a	Making sure the audience knows that the writers ''get it'' with a little humor and some crazy action makes the silliness easy to forgive and fun to watch.
23685	5	a	For a movie centered on a game without rules, Crossover is pretty formulaic.
23686	6	a	Tedious and derivative, it will soon be long forgotten.
23687	5	a	This is a very pretty movie with a very compelling premise and very talented actors, but pacing, hazily conceived characters and a rather simplistic approach to psychology make it very hard to love.
23688	6	a	The movie is appealing enough to make you want to believe it, even when you don't.
23689	6	a	[A] sweet, sincere, massively overrated valentine to silent movies.
23690	5	a	To those of us on the greying side of five years old, Barney looks like an eggplant and has a rigor-mortis smile, no shoulders, a huge rear end and the sort of nervous giggle that makes you think he has something to hide.
23691	5	a	Writer-director Derrick Borte takes this somewhat clever concept and turns it into a muddled mix of weak social commentary, predictable drama and wan comedy.
23692	4	a	A sometimes gripping, sometimes funny, and sometimes maddening portrait of a family that cannot deal with their internal problems.
23693	5	a	The effects are done well, but we are long past the era in which good special effects alone could carry a movie.
23694	5	a	Strictly a 'guy's film' in the worst sense of the expression.
23695	6	a	Incapable of spreading Moreau's passion and sadness to its crime-thriller narrative.
23696	2	a	Though a cookie-cutter crime tale, this one stands outfor some fierce ensemble performances.
23697	2	a	The implications of the choice eventually made -- and the slow and steady unravelling of all lives involved -- are tough to process, but touchingly, truly portrayed here.
23698	1	a	"There's a stirring freshness to the cinema of ""Selma,"" and it's not just because of Bradford Young's rich, moody photography."
23699	4	a	Anderson, as always, knows exactly what he's doing with the camera. Scenes are often staged in the haze of smoke or fog; sometimes characters are introduced late into the frame, or action happens just out of it.
23700	4	a	Whiskey Tango Foxtrot is entertaining sometimes, but if you're looking for any real insight, you're looking in the wrong place.
23701	3	a	Intellectually provocative and ultimately profoundly affecting.
23702	0	a	One of the greatest horror films made. The opening sequence is not only a classic, it's still frightening nearly three decades after it was made.
23703	4	a	You'll admire the doggie tricks and tolerate the rest, which is both the best and worst thing that can be said about it.
23704	3	a	Ava DuVernay's Selma is a beautifully observed drama of public and private lives, of personal narratives and historic moments.
23705	5	a	The Angriest Man in Brooklyn is hampered by heavy-handed direction and an unbelievable script with a schmaltzy ending.
23706	0	a	The already towering reputation of this film and its director continues only to grow.
23707	4	a	Hitchcock gets points for being more ambitious than your average tried-and-true Hollywood memoir - even if it's only moderately successful in that task.
23708	3	a	"Here's a solid urban story that's ""Waist Deep"" in action."
23709	7	a	About as thrilling as cleaning out your garage.
23710	1	a	Owen Wilson is either an acquired taste or a comedic force who gathers more momentum and skill as he goes. In any case, he gets funnier and funnier with each film.
23711	4	a	A high concept window in on the direction George Lucas could have gone.
23712	1	a	[An] astute and askew look at human behaviour.
23713	5	a	Its throwback elements offer more in the way of irritating limitations than timelessness.
23714	2	a	The cast ... performs with such subtlety and ingenuity that all sense of narrative artifice vanishes.
23715	5	a	Universal ruins Christmas and ends the cult of Keanu in one fell swoop.
23716	3	a	The fresh and witty script by Isaac Aptaker and Elizabeth Berger seems like a contemporary heir to those eighties initiatory comedies that John Hughes dominated so well... [Full review in Spanish]
23717	4	a	Unfortunately, the movie just makes Stump look like a self-important jerk, possibly a bigger jerk than Cobb, and Wuhl's affable, weightless performance doesn't help.
23718	4	a	This unabashed Harry Potter clone is enjoyable enough, thanks to Black's campy theatricality and Blanchett's sly minimalism.
23719	5	a	The comedy quotient, waning from the start, becomes nonexistent whenever it's placed in Romano's clumsy mitts.
23720	3	a	A poignant and funny coming-of-age tale that encapsulates the angst, awkwardness, and frustration of trying to find yourself in the cruel world of high school.
23721	4	a	Eminem's edgy, graphic quasi-biopic is not for kids.
23722	3	a	Blanchett and Mara are superb at executing one of the cinema's great gifts: the exchanged glance, held long enough to scorch even the well-mannered Fifties.
23723	1	a	"... ""Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri"" really sings because of Frances McDormand, who is so utterly majestic, hilarious, heartfelt, dominant, and effective that not even those superlatives really do her justice."
23724	5	a	"White,"" despite its best intentions, is often too simplified for mass acceptance, losing big screen appeal once the audience realizes that everything about the picture would be better suited for the small screen. "
23725	4	a	While a little Jarmusch is a good thing, a lot can be a bit much to take. At least when he's in this mood.
23726	5	a	It's not ambitious, but neither is it lazy. It works hard at its dumbness, and it's eager to please. For what it's worth, it's the most enjoyable bad movie of the year.
23727	5	a	A strangely boring, dramatically inert film in which the main characters remain as opaque and unreadable as sphinxes to the very last.
23728	1	a	Mangold's daring use of Stallone, the quality of the acting ensemble, the depth of the characterizations, and the off-beat blend of Western motifs in a police drama all mark the director as a young filmmaker worth watching.
23729	3	a	There are no easy answers in the film and it provides a welcome relief from the horror and action films that are filling the multiplexes. Jindabyne tackles adult topics in a subtle and intriguing manner.
23730	9	a	Like Cry Freedom without the laughs. Morgan Freeman plays Nelson Mandela in a pious, bromidic, wet-all-over film that slops from triumph to set-piece triumph.
23731	4	a	Despite its relatively ludicrous dramatic escalation towards the end, I rather enjoyed this.
23732	2	a	This is sure-fire family entertainment during school vacation week. Indeed, it's for Aardman fans of all ages.
23733	4	a	A fish tale worth telling and worth hearing.
23734	2	a	Writer Richard Jefferies' solid script emphasizes character and psychology over plot and provides Dennis Quaid and Sharon Stone with engaging, multidimensional starring roles.
23735	4	a	Sinatra, Davis, and Martin performed their club acts at night and worked on this Las Vegas-set film during the day, and the good time they were having fairly jumps off the screen.
23736	1	a	It's powerful and powerfully musical.
23737	3	a	... Equilibrium is one of the better action/sci-fi movies of the year ...
23738	4	a	We admire the cheek and chic of how it's done. We wonder quite why it was thought worth doing.
23739	3	a	In most areas, Cassavetes's instincts are spot-on, particularly when it comes to casting Timberlake in what turns out to be the most important role in the film. He manages to be both reprehensible and deeply charismatic, and winds up stealing the picture.
23740	3	a	[It] isn't the last word on this chapter of music history... but with great music and solid performances, it's good place to start.
23741	7	a	The most peculiar aspect of the movie is that some of it is played straight.
23742	3	a	The result, if rather thin and certainly far from a masterpiece, is nevertheless quite lovely. This affecting little film is easily one of Eastwood's best efforts as a director.
23743	4	a	Ridiculous? Yep. Fun? Absolutely. If there's such a thing as a classy B-movie, then this is it.
23744	1	a	A richly satisfying film that compassionately probes the human heart while preserving its elusive mysteries.
23745	4	a	While it's neat to see another addition to the Predator universe, the payoff here doesn't exactly feel like it was worth the decade-long wait.
23746	5	a	Three's a trilogy, four's a bore.
23747	3	a	A rawer, realer, and far more believable and compelling portrait of a self-destructive country artist's attempt at recovery than CRAZY HEART.
23748	6	a	The movie's contrivances begin to rankle.
23749	4	a	The film, like its oddly rumbling sky, promises more than it ever delivers. Granted, it can look cool. But more often, as we wait for the lightning that never arrives, it frustrates.
23750	1	a	"Real people, real situations. ""Laurel Canyon"" is a keeper."
23751	9	a	A horribly misguided idea that never really gets off the ground yet still finds a way to crash-land, but even criticizing its obvious flaws misses the central, sad point: This movie has too much Bill Murray in it.
23752	3	a	Teller gives an incredibly physical performance, believable in the ring, awkwardly stationary throughout the movie's midsection, his eyes always on the prize
23753	6	a	You end up feeling sorry for all the actors forced to humiliate themselves, except for McConaughey, whose portrayal of sadistic, manipulative evil is mesmerizing.
23754	5	a	"Haven't we seen this somewhere before? We have: the infinitely superior ""Madame Rosa."
23755	9	a	With the humor in this lazy farce about as subtle as a shotgun blast to the face, it's possible to see the whole movie as an accident, the cumulative result of haphazard negligence.
23756	4	a	...the first time feature filmmakers, quite professionally, crossed the continent and collected a myriad of interviews and anecdotes about love.
23757	2	a	Everything, even the explicit puppet sex, has a satirical message.
23758	6	a	The Darkest Minds suffers from a run-of-the-mill quality that's woefully prevalent in all its various attributes...
23759	4	a	Amiable, lightweight fare that adults might appreciate more than children.
23760	9	a	It's too easy to say that Peter Billingsley shot his eye out with this inept comic trifle, but...well, he shot his eye out.
23761	6	a	Parts of the film really stand out, but taken as a whole, it's a labyrinth of conflicting ideas.
23762	4	a	It's preposterous, but I dare you not to smile at the high-kicking silliness on offer, or the sweetly old-fashioned undertones ...
23763	6	a	Despite its many issues, Ready Player One is still an enjoyable ride that ticks all the boxes of a big summer blockbuster.
23764	10	a	It ended up almost as infamous and notorious as its subject... and that's not a compliment.
23765	3	a	... a powerful presentation.
23766	1	a	Classic le Carre, with one last great performance by Philip Seymour Hoffman
23767	4	a	As animation, this is top class, and a mile away from the orthodox. Some of the detail is terrific, and the screenplay is sharply intelligent.
23768	0	a	Everything in it is wonderfully right.
23769	7	a	Contrived and pretentious from title card to end credits.
23770	4	a	corny but creepy
23771	0	a	Sublime, another rapturous family story from Japanese auteur Hirokazu Koreeda.
23772	2	a	It was fun and I got what I wanted ? that seems to happen less and less these days in the cinema, we should take all we can get.
23773	4	a	Feel-good religious drama wasn't going my way, but it's hard to resist such good-hearted schmaltz.
23774	3	a	"Some might dismiss this tale of a blooming wallflower as simply a manipulative twee fantasy. But for those of us who trust in Field, this film will have us at ""Hello."
23775	1	a	If you haven't succumbed to movie TMI about World's End, stop reading now, go see this smart and hilarious comedy about the double-edged sword called nostalgia, and read my review later.
23776	2	a	painstakingly teased out
23777	6	a	There are some interesting people here, but they seem outnumbered by those that are extremely dull.
23778	1	a	DuVernay, with just her third feature film, knows how to marshal the moments that will become history, making her own iconic images.
23779	4	a	Chou steals the show, especially when he speeds into action in glorious Kato-Vision.
23780	4	a	"Regardless of its fine cast and stylish execution, the shallow ""American Hustle"" sells sparkle and hustle. "
23781	1	a	Its greatest trick is that it's a meditation on the nature of reality and identity disguised as entertainment.
23782	3	a	Features such strong performances and original circumstances that even the most stalwart cynic will likely succumb to its charismatic charm.
23783	2	a	A sharp-looking vehicle, even if there's not much going on under the hood.
23784	6	a	The film sadly turns cloying and queasy. 
23785	1	a	Gleefully profane, excessively violent, and refreshingly lewd.
23786	1	a	The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford is an engrossing and hypnotic western that places a heavy emphasis on atmosphere, character and reality. 
23787	1	a	Seductive blend of mythology and travelogue...there's still sensual pleasure in the urban scenery, colorful visions, and music and dance, most of it defined by joyful abandon. [Blu-ray]
23788	3	a	It's easy to toss around words like disturbing, eerie, and violence when Hitchcock is involved, but, turns out, the film version of a portion of his life is enjoyable and surprisingly heartwarming.
23789	6	a	Few of [the actors] are able to compete with the wigs and the platitudes.
23790	4	a	The Imitation Game may not be the big screen biography Turing deserves, but if this is the one that introduces his work to wider audiences, we'll take it.
23791	0	a	Mixed in with an outstanding performance from Ethan Hawke, First Reformed is a truly stunning film that can only get better on repeat viewings.
23792	6	a	There are moments when you want to nudge Hereafter to make sure it's awake.
23793	1	a	It's weird and surreal, but it ends with most of the holes plugged and all but a few of the loose ends tied into a tidy package. Some argue this is a cheat and the film should have been more open ended. That's a personal choice; I like it the way it is.
23794	10	a	Zero chemistry, zero tension, zero laughs, zero everything.
23795	1	a	Mystic River is refreshingly adult; Eastwood doesn't pander to a younger crowd
23796	6	a	Martin Landau's performance as Lugosi is inspired. He should win an Oscar for it. The rest of the film, unfortunately, is not that good.
23797	0	a	Just when you thought you had seen the best movie there is about a historic seagoing vessel, along comes Amistad.
23798	5	a	Great idea for a tasteless short, but not enough for a feature.
23799	6	a	Though probably well-intentioned, Radio comes off as manipulative of its audience and exploitative of the mentally challenged.
23800	1	a	Although it suffers from the same lack of focus that plagued the book, the result is bloody hilarious and occasionally brilliant.
23801	7	a	I was so annoyed with Foster's character that I hoped the air marshal would put a bullet in her brain and thus end the misery for the audience.
23802	4	a	Underneath the unhinged surfaces of this film is a tight little thriller that really grabs hold and never lets go.
23803	3	a	It's like this film almost sneaks up on you as you're watching it. At first it's just quirky/cute, but it becomes much more. Mark Duplass gives his best performance.
23804	4	a	A simple, sentimental family drama for the holidays, Evelyn, alas, is also predictable and schematic.
23805	6	a	Arctic Tale does afford us some beautiful landscape cinematography and up-close looks at creatures in the wild...
23806	2	a	This is a heart-wrenching drama about the difficult choices people make for the ones they love and the unintended consequences of those actions.
23807	6	a	"It wants to be ""Midnight Run"" meets ""Planes, Trains and Automobiles,"" but it carries little of the dramatic heft and real-world semi-plausibility of those much superior efforts."
23808	4	a	Even a lesser Bertolucci is an event, and Stealing Beauty has its charms.
23809	5	a	This is an overlong, empty bore that squanders its possibilities.
23810	3	a	It's a smart, solid, kinetically-charged spy flick worthy of a couple hours of summertime and a bucket of popcorn. Nothing overly original, mind you, but solidly entertaining.
23811	4	a	This sparky if flawed effort deserves re-evaluation.
23812	3	a	Dern's line delivery alone - all of his lines are delivered as if he was just awakened from a deep sleep, a flashlight thrust in his face - is worth the price of admission,
23813	3	a	A film which proves Hollywood is still capable of turning out comedies that are as intelligent and original as they are feelgood.
23814	1	a	Romero hasn't let the kids today show him up one bit.
23815	3	a	Remember when Demi looked good naturally?
23816	5	a	This overlong sequel is short of magic.
23817	3	a	A lighthearted, good-natured motion picture that contains enough humor to leaven the tone and keep the drama from becoming too serious.
23818	2	a	It's an interesting parable/western and, perhaps, a start for Stallone's new career.
23819	5	a	An act of nose-thumbing that never quite figures out how, or even where, to position its thumb.
23820	4	a	"Foster is the reason to see ""Flightplan""; she lends the film both a consummate strength and vulnerability."
23821	9	a	An inert pageant of waxen figures that fails completely as drama even as it insults the sensibilities of anyone not clinging to rosy memories of the slave-era South.
23822	3	a	Making his debut behind the camera, Oscar winner Philip Seymour Hoffman directs like he acts, with a sharp eye for the small details that cut to the soul of a character.
23823	3	a	If you accept this Defence as a compromise of its source ... you should find a lot to enjoy
23824	4	a	The Prestige's magic pales in comparison to other 'magical' films released this year.
23825	4	a	"If ""Reign of Fire"" could have spared a few more bucks to pump up the thrills and spent a little longer working out the story's ending, it might have become one of the highest grossing films of the summer."
23826	6	a	Filmdom's greatest villain Hannibal Lecter has been both defanged and declawed.
23827	2	a	Bustamante's well crafted film is authentically steeped in a nearly alien culture but its humanity is entirely familiar.
23828	5	a	Almost unbearable, overlong and empty melodrama.
23829	5	a	The film so goes against the grain of seculist and feminist thought that you just have to shrug your shoulders and ask: Hell, is it any good as a movie? Not really.
23830	4	a	It may be a tad too long and a wee bit self-indulgent. But with sumptuous production design and great acting, it's all done with Almodovar's usual flair and perfect taste.
23831	4	a	The sour subplot, in which Sara's dark side mistakes Hitch for a cad, staggers to a gummy resolution, throwing a wet-blanket reminder that romantic comedy -- indeed, romance itself -- isn't what it used to be.
23832	2	a	Amy Adams is absolutely adorable as the enchanting fish-out-of-water princess.
23833	1	a	It is great to see Cage go from comedy to sentimentality to drama.
23834	5	a	Despite the open-air connotation of the title, there's a curiously constricted, even suffocating quality to 'Agora' that leaves it...a chore to sit through.
23835	5	a	Miller is a genuine surprise as the damaged star. But the film leaves her very much as it finds her: a clueless naive.
23836	5	a	Stockwell fails even to define major plot points, leaving us to figure them out later from the dialogue.
23837	5	a	It tells what many consider the greatest real-life boxing comebacks in history, but on-screen it rarely feels like anything but a run-of-the-mill fight picture.
23838	4	a	A plaintive, sensitively-handled tale reminiscent of vintage Hollywood dramas such as Marty that knew how to tell such stories without seeming quite so self-conscious.
23839	7	a	Alvin and the Chipmunks: The Road Chip is terrible for adults, and exposing your kids to this money-grab will not make them any smarter.
23840	1	a	One of the year's most unfairly invisible successes.
23841	3	a	Embrace of the Serpent swells with unhappy images, but it is also fired by poetry and, in Karamakate, it has one of cinema's great stubborn heroes.
23842	3	a	In addition to the inspired direction of Jocelyn Moorhouse, The Dressmaker draws ably on the united effort of an appreciably committed cast.
23843	3	a	A breathless sequel with tense intellectual punch, smart, seat-gripping action, and a hero who is utterly compelling, almost without saying a word.
23844	3	a	The ace in the hole in Wild Wild West is Shakespearean Kenneth Branagh as the villain, Loveless.
23845	6	a	We are told a lot about Jesse James during the elongated run time -- but learn very little about the man at all.
23846	3	a	A post-apocalyptic survival drama that is claustrophobic, chilling and unbearably tense. 
23847	0	a	Nim's journey is profoundly moving...
23848	5	a	When the satire works, it is a thing of Dada wonder. Sharp absurdity played with a nimble spirit. When it doesn't, it is a pallid, bloated thing smugly vamping for its own amusement
23849	1	a	...straddles the stylistic gulf between David Lynch and the Coen brothers. It is a creepy film, beautiful in odd and disturbing ways.
23850	2	a	Love, Rosie succeeds well enough on its own, largely due to the fabulous chemistry between the leads, who bring their flawed, well-rounded characters to life in a funny, warm and amiable manner.
23851	3	a	The less you try to figure out Anderson's rambling, mesmerising mystery, the better. Just relax and let this beautiful, haunting, hilarious, chaotic, irritating and possibly profound tragicomedy wash over you.
23852	8	a	That both Seth MacFarlane and Neil Patrick Harris are in this and neither performs the one musical number is enough evidence that the movie is altogether wrongheaded.
23853	3	a	Anton Corbijn's new thriller is perhaps the best so far to tackle the war on terror, thanks to an ingeniously twisty and deeply cynical storyline, plus a towering performance from Philip Seymour Hoffman.
23854	6	a	A Million Ways to Die in the West spends more time trying to push the buttons of its audience rather than entertaining it. It's amusing in small doses, but as a whole it's about three horseshoes away from being an atrocity to the comedy genre.
23855	2	a	A very compelling movie that's almost ruined by a horrible narration track.
23856	5	a	Anyone with a passing knowledge of King's jam-packed oeuvre and its spotty movie translations will be fidgeting in their seats from the get-go.
23857	6	a	Be warned. When the makers of Must Love Dogs want you to like somebody, they slam your hand in a drawer until you say uncle.
23858	0	a	Beautifully, horribly passionate.
23859	1	a	Possibly the most amusing mainstream live-action comedy since There's Something About Mary.
23860	6	a	The point is to show the misery of a underprivileged woman ahead of her time, but so much dedication for such a small payoff makes you wonder why.
23861	3	a	A well-crafted grifter tale with heart.
23862	2	a	With outstanding performances from a brilliant ensemble cast, Middle Men turns out to be wickedly entertaining with some of the best acting you will see all year.
23863	2	a	"Menashe"" is a little slice of life, delivered with a knowing sense of truth."
23864	6	a	Sometimes artful doesn't make up for annoying.
23865	5	a	Lavishly produced by Zanuck, this big-budget historical epic is preposterously plotted and acted, though Shamroy's color cinematography is good. 
23866	9	a	The film starts better than you've heard, but soon gets worse than you predicted.
23867	6	a	While the film retains some of the DNA of the original TV series, it bears more similarity to such recent fare as Wall-E and Transformers.
23868	7	a	No matter if you're a basketball fan, a cartoon fan, or a movie fan, Space Jam offers little that will excite you or involve you. You'd get more excitement watching a local pick-up game.
23869	2	a	The film's sense of imagery gives it a terrible strength, but it's propelled by the acting.
23870	4	a	I'm half tempted to run for the border on this one.
23871	6	a	It tries to become a brainy horror movie without bothering to plug its many plot holes large enough to drive anyone with half a brain to distraction.
23872	4	a	For all of Cianfrance's seriousness, the material proves too essentially melodramatic, hokey and self-serious to save. No gorgeous cinematography and no cast, no matter how A-list, can ultimately save this material from itself.
23873	5	a	Even if the material is terribly formulaic and derivative, it's still such a simple, by-the-numbers romantic comedy that only a Herculean effort could mess it up. And the filmmakers have managed to do exactly that.
23874	0	a	Eastwood... tell[s] one of the tritest and overused of sports movie plots: the scrappy underdog team that has to win the big game. Ah, but context is everything.
23875	3	a	Like a jumpy, coke-fueled Pied Piper, Cage takes viewers to the very precipice of depraved self-abasement, while preserving just enough self-conscious humor to keep from tumbling in.
23876	1	a	Lemmons, her extraordinary cast and gifted crew deliver laughing, crying and plenty of signifying.
23877	0	a	Spielberg's list of great movies is too long to catalog here, but rest assured: War of the Worlds now ranks among them.
23878	6	a	Hickenlooper likes to observe chaos and artistic extremes with a friendly eye, and there are hints all through Factory Girl of the shattering film it could have been. But the story falls too easily into 'live fast, die young' laments and postures.
23879	4	a	When the script puts its faith in the audience, allowing us to find the laughs on our own, the film is irresistible, a bright lark. Yet when the writers panic, upping the antic volume and shifting into crazed sitcom gear, the lark stops.
23880	1	a	Hopeful about the ability for man to persevere in a capricious world.
23881	6	a	The oversized terrapins are characteristically flip as they backflip through an unnecessarily muddled plot.
23882	0	a	Don't move, don't blink, and don't breathe... make The Prestige your new dark obsession.
23883	6	a	Foster doesn't make a lot of movies these days...but I'm starting to wish she'd be a little more selective about what she deigns to appear in.
23884	3	a	Engrossing western which inspired a huge genre revivial.
23885	6	a	Digresses into that hazy zone where we're not sure if we're watching overwrought drama or a joke that just isn't funny.
23886	9	a	Stay away.
23887	3	a	A holiday-themed piece shot through with humor and heartbreak. No bull. And low on sappy.
23888	5	a	Your average five-year-old could have constructed a plot with fewer holes in it.
23889	7	a	That's a reasonable message, but it might feel more resonant if the script were a little fairer to both sexes.
23890	2	a	It avoids the predictable narrative arc - hardscrabble youth, rise to fame, descent into drugs, etc. - by scrambling the Brown chronology and shooting for a more thematic organizing structure marked by smart transitions.
23891	1	a	A completely satisfying thriller that will keep your brain engaged and your adrenaline pumping.
23892	5	a	Turing is kept tweedy and neutered, as closeted in celluloid as he was in real life. 
23893	4	a	I really could go on all day about how aesthetically imaginative and gorgeous this movie is, but in reality, the only thing that will do it justice is seeing it for yourself.
23894	3	a	Obvious nods to old sci-fi gems ... also enter the crowded picture, which falls short of perfection only during a prolonged last few minutes when the gang bravely reaches beyond formula.
23895	2	a	A Perfect Getaway is not an Oscar worthy film, but it sure passes the time and packs a great punch at the end.
23896	3	a	Marks a more mature worldview and understanding of relationships from [Apatow's] last film.
23897	10	a	The lowest point on Chevy Chase's career.
23898	6	a	Jolie brings a degree of unpredictability to her character which makes her more intriguing than the material or something like that.
23899	4	a	It's all a tad slight and glossy, but the performances redeem it ...
23900	2	a	A girl-power comedy with a bold twist: The timid heroine blossoms in Afghanistan, one of the most female-unfriendly countries on earth. 
23901	5	a	To say the love story was hard to believe, is putting it mildly--it was impossible to fathom.
23902	4	a	It's a serviceable adventure film that does the job in less time than the original film.
23903	2	a	If this movie offends or shocks you, then the past couple seasons of South Park will kill you.
23904	3	a	Whenever we return to that bus, the action is as riveting as in any thriller.
23905	3	a	Cumberbatch moves effortlessly from master thinker to vulnerable lost soul to socially awkward twit to cagey pragmatist. 
23906	4	a	to film asxoleitai me ton erwta toys, apo th skopia ths Fanny, apo th skopia petaloydas poy sboyrizei anemela mexri na brei sto libadi poihth na toy royfhksei to nektar
23907	3	a	Miller is undeniably engaging. That's probably not enough to save the movie from obscurity, but it should, at the very least, guarantee bigger and better things for its star.
23908	2	a	Cold-blooded reptiles are lurking everywhere in the slick new noir Bad Lieutenant: Port of Call New Orleans, with snakes, iguanas, gators and especially Nicolas Cage at their slithering and cynical best.
23909	6	a	"The first sign that somebody will be wholly unable to effectively communicate with kids today is when they refer to them as ""kids today."
23910	3	a	A moderately suspenseful thriller that seems somewhat conventional compared to De Palma's earlier envelope-pushing efforts. Intriguing, but the mystery villain is rather obvious from the start.
23911	2	a	This anti-Western set in the dusty southwest is pretty good for the first two acts, but burns out well before the end.
23912	4	a	Ferris Bueller said it best: 'Life moves pretty fast. If you don't stop and look around once in a while, you could miss it.' 'Paper Towns' reminds us not to miss our life.
23913	0	a	One of the year's most visually dazzling and emotionally satisfying adventures.
23914	6	a	It's a good effort, but not up to the level of the best Disney cartoon feature.
23915	1	a	The Coens stir up more panic by quietly flicking off a light switch than Michael Bay did with a fleet of Decepticons.
23916	5	a	Like stepping forth, in an explosion of colors, weird body shapes and bad comedy, into somebody else's migraine.
23917	3	a	Neither biopic nor civil-rights melodrama, Invictus is a rich study of how wisdom, intellect and history are often most influential when they are sold with a price of admission
23918	1	a	Two hours and small change seems like a lot for any movie comedy to ask of its audience. But it's hard to imagine how much Knocked Up could shed from its baggy frame without diminishing its roughhousing charms.
23919	2	a	One of those rare sequels that is as good as the original movie.
23920	1	a	Director Sofia Coppola's second feature film is so smart and, yet, simple that it is nearly perfect.
23921	5	a	Gordon is miscast and the script is neither as funny nor as emotionally engaging as it should have been.
23922	1	a	Like an orphan out of Dickens, Nim is a sorrowful figure buffeted by the winds of the greedy, selfish and more powerful...
23923	6	a	Me, I liked Anaconda better.
23924	3	a	"L'Auberge Espagnole"" isn't a perfect, or at times very even, film, but it's chock-full of a kind of experimentation and fun rarely found in the slick, polished and ready for the masses fare that the studios usually traffic in"
23925	3	a	The Bourne Supremacy is a dynamite sequel that begs for at least one more outing with this spy who refuses to come in from the cold.
23926	3	a	Hysterical.
23927	3	a	"To see ""Selma"" is to feel and appreciate anew the burden of greatness."
23928	4	a	Strikes a middle ground between surrealism and pop culture.
23929	1	a	Dern as Woody is a fascinating portrait of opacity.
23930	5	a	It is perhaps one of the unsubtlest satires and lamest of American social allegories I've ever seen. 
23931	6	a	Invictus tells the tale in the standard Hollywood way
23932	3	a	[Depp] turns Secret Window into a pleasantly show-offy showcase for his own charisma.
23933	6	a	There have been a lot of movies about how fake Hollywood is, but this is the fake Hollywood movie about how fake Hollywood is.
23934	5	a	This is a movie that never aspires to be anything more than dimwitted fun, then falls on its aspirations.
23935	3	a	An entertaining and sad time warp romance comedy...
23936	1	a	Even die-hard Sean Connery fans will have to admit there's another actor who can portray James Bond when they see 'Skyfall.'
23937	3	a	Skyfall is visually impressive from beginning to end, offers what feels like the closing of one exciting Bond chapter and the opening of another, and features some of the most blood pumping action sequences of the Daniel Craig Bond films.
23938	3	a	A timeless, forbidden, and music-cued affair of the heart.
23939	2	a	This charmer about late middle-aged renaissance is pertinent for these times and a perfect summer comedy for grown-ups looking to escape robots and superheroes.
23940	3	a	It's a screaming endorsement to the power of cinema... without saying a word.
23941	4	a	The plot is sentimental fluff. But this has energy and invention enough to keep Lasseter top of the heap.
23942	3	a	Races along with the swift, brutal precision of a samurai sword cutting through cotton.
23943	6	a	Another ground-breaking show about nothing -- a hornet's nest of hype for a fat hive of nothing.
23944	1	a	A relatively-morose morality play likely to land its share of accolades during award season provided everyone stops comparing it to Gump.
23945	4	a	Often harrowing and naturalistic but ultimately self-important in its indictment of police-state politics.
23946	2	a	An unfussy, rambling crowd-pleaser that recalls elements of the filmmaker's past work ...
23947	1	a	[Murray] can still do more with a raised eyebrow than anyone since Groucho Marx, but he's mellower and sometimes slightly poignant.
23948	3	a	From lesser actors, the story would have definitely become the worst Nicholas Sparks film adaptation ever. But they make you feel for them, even when they're making poor life decisions that you know will end miserably.
23949	3	a	"Raunchy and irreverent, ""A Million Ways to Die in the West"" proves there are a million ways to laugh in the West."
23950	3	a	Adults should get a good kick out of these animal characters and the exemplary personality quirks that go beyond just image perfection.
23951	4	a	When they're on-screen together, it's better than electrifying -- it's rhapsodic.
23952	6	a	Occasional bouts of naughty words aside, this retirement-age comedy is essentially unoffensive, at times touching, and mostly lukewarm.
23953	0	a	One of the most underrated Westerns ever made.
23954	9	a	What an ugly, idiotic mess this is. 
23955	3	a	Nothing more or less than scary noirish fun, low on thematic ambition but giddily high on the fright front.
23956	1	a	The brainiacs at Pixar have created human characters as vivid and believable and utterly endearing as any who have ever appeared on film
23957	1	a	I'm not saying this is a John Cassavetes film or anything, but the movie's ability to uncork one great line after another that evokes both a laugh and an uncomfortable feeling of recognition is masterful.
23958	5	a	During the India scenes, Liz accuses Richard from Texas of spouting a bunch of bumper-sticker slogans... as though her revelations are any better.
23959	4	a	Far more insightful than the similar but overblown Natural Born Killers.
23960	6	a	The film's three leads deliver competent yet thoroughly uninspired performances, with Wilson offering up the latest variation on his laid-back, cool-guy persona...
23961	6	a	The Edge of Love holds a lot of promise in its first hour and never completely falls apart, but it's ultimately not the movie it might have been.
23962	4	a	This may be a musical, but don't expect a good time; it's a grim tragedy that's deliberately drab and exceedingly painful to watch.
23963	2	a	Logan Lucky builds to one of those impossibly complicated heists that only ever happen in movies and rather contradicts the notion that the Logans are stupid or cursed. 
23964	4	a	The Prestige is filled with lots of suspenseful twists and turns, deeply engaging performances from co-stars Hugh Jackman and Christian Bale and a powerful conclusion that will make you want to see it again.
23965	0	a	Safety Not Guaranteed casts an enchanting spell from its opening scene.
23966	6	a	Though gimmicky, implausible and repetitious with too many angles, this thriller is still worth seeing as exercise in audience participation in narrative creation and as commentary on the manipulative processes of filmmaking and engagement of spectators
23967	8	a	If the very idea of an Angry Birds movie feels about four years too late, know that it also has a joke about gluten.
23968	0	a	Such a wonderful mix of sight and sound, of humor and drama, of love and hate, of ugliness and beauty.
23969	3	a	Based on the biography by Andrew Hodges, Imitation illuminates Turing's brilliance in an engrossing and moving film that features a standout, Oscar-worthy performance by Benedict Cumberbatch.
23970	1	a	"Ready Player One"" is an engrossing thrill ride that feeds off of your pop culture nostalgia."
23971	3	a	Anyone who likes pop music or wonders how bands like the Rolling Stones got rolling will enjoy the ride.
23972	0	a	It's a sharp, funny, tender and surprising film that pivots on Murray.
23973	4	a	A technical step forward from South Park.
23974	5	a	Their Billion Dollar Movie will not win new converts, and their stretched-out routines demonstrate the old saw about less sometimes being more.
23975	7	a	The devices that run this strained comedy are as shallow as some of the residents in the titular Hollywood neighborhood.
23976	5	a	'The Last Witch Hunter' has a promising occult plot and great visual effects, but is derailed by poor acting and disjointed action scenes.
23977	8	a	Good Luck Chuck looks like the unscreenable bits of bad movies best forgotten retrieved from the cutting-room floor.
23978	4	a	There is some great acting here, and some scenes do have an undercurrent of elemental power in them that tugs at your ankles. But the film never pulls you in.
23979	9	a	An obnoxious movie in which potential adventure is sideswiped in favor of watery characters and dialogue that feels like it was lifted from five or six reality shows.
23980	1	a	A motion picture for anyone who loves movies, revels in the art of filmmaking, and appreciates the special, one-of-a-kind, cathartic power of great horror cinema.
23981	6	a	Alfie smacks its dog with a rolled-up newspaper and then feels guilty about it. This one has star power and nothing else, y'know what I mean?
23982	1	a	The outlines of the story may seem soapy, but the details of the place, time, and culture used to tell the story elevate it to a meaningful and moving saga of identity, longing, and resiliance, as exquisitely presented as a silk kimono.
23983	4	a	David Fincher's wildly overlong adaptation of the F. Scott Fitzgerald short story misses a key point from its source material: the story should be a short one.
23984	7	a	A film so narrowly focused as to be inaccessible for all but the devout.
23985	1	a	The Edge of Seventeen is a delight, with Hailee Steinfeld serving as the radiant star at its center.
23986	9	a	"It's a grotesque, repellent, macabre costume drama. If you want depravity, watch re-runs of the mini-series ""Rome"" on HBO."
23987	6	a	Everyone speaks in the sweatily polysyllabic, Look-at-This-Writing-I'm-Doing tone that makes a page of Wallace pass like an hour on the treadmill, and the men are dopes or creeps.
23988	9	a	One laugh, courtesy of Pitt's intellect-signifying dicky bow; the rest is arrant, po-faced nonsense.
23989	7	a	Then there is 'Gods and Generals,' cut from the same production cloth as 'Gettysburg' but a film of very loose ends.
23990	3	a	Lee sustains the bubbling hilarity, but also provides quieter, deeper observation of the characters' motives and moods.
23991	3	a	There are moments that feel just on the edge of silly, but that's the idea.
23992	8	a	Disagreeable, unlikable, unwatchable.
23993	4	a	There can only ever be one Bad Lieutenant: Harvey Keitel.
23994	6	a	Both Foxx and Union have a sexy, oft-kilter chemistry that suits them perfectly. There is an unavoidable attraction to the two, their romance hitting almost all the right notes even as the rest of the flick sours the stomach.
23995	2	a	The all-important production design perfectly captures a generation of unthinking consumers. And Moore and Duchovny, who have great chemistry, are strong enough to make the most of a script that really needed another rewrite.
23996	1	a	What makes this film so worthy is the understanding it gives us both of the wolf in sheep's clothing and of the betrayal of trust.
23997	6	a	Fresh, occasionally funny, but ultimately feeble.
23998	3	a	David O. Russell has created this riveting world full of eccentric, well-rounded characters. American Hustle is a crime drama that is constantly engaging, hilarious, and stimulating. Christian Bale is sleazy perfection. 
23999	2	a	Respectfully pokes fun at the ups and downs of life all while making this fictional story feel very real resulting in a particularly satisfying experience.
24000	0	a	An amazing black satire filled with vicious biting words that snap like firecrackers.
24001	0	a	...one of the most original films of this decade. 
24002	1	a	This marks [Farmiga's] arrival as One to Watch. See her here, and you can say you remember the early days.
24003	4	a	Even if viewed entirely on its own terms, this film, like any snake, tapers at its end.
24004	0	a	Just as extraordinary as always ... even diamonds get a periodic polish.
24005	3	a	The familiarity of the setting and everyday items clashes with the Armageddon atmosphere and the eerie soundtrack to make a strangely creepy setting.
24006	3	a	War of the Worlds may not stand up well to careful inspection and it may not be the smartest science fiction film brought to the screen, but it is an intense, visceral experience.
24007	4	a	Thel heady film has its moments when it thaws out.
24008	4	a	Not a bad movie, but it is a film likely to alienate the fan base of the comic book on which it is based.
24009	4	a	Chucky is as good being bad as ever but the story falls short
24010	0	a	A stunning indictment of Brazil's social meltdown, this startling documentary plays like City Of God -- except this time the bullets are real.
24011	0	a	Watching Paul Thomas Anderson's wonderfully textured and intricate LA-set Inherent Vice, you are easily reminded of the famous story about Howard Hawks' version of The Big Sleep.
24012	2	a	"...with ""The Bourne Identity"" we return to the more traditional action genre."
24013	1	a	Hancock leaps fluidly from comedy to action to romance. And it has bigger surprises in store.
24014	2	a	[Flows] with a simplicity that is almost childlike in its optimism.
24015	4	a	Those good qualities are undermined, unfortunately, by the Switchblade Sam character, who is dirty, threatening and scary.
24016	4	a	Mark Wahlberg's titular hero hasn't cracked a smile in seven years. The surprise is that he makes the lonely cop seem half human with half a dozen words and a staggering amount of violence.
24017	1	a	It's still a Chuck Norris movie, of course, but it focuses on strong characters, interesting situations, and an appealingly gritty, urban realism.
24018	4	a	full review in Greek
24019	1	a	Howard Hawks made Rio Bravo as a conservative response to the liberal High Noon.
24020	1	a	Perhaps most astonishing of all is that in a film filled such terrific performances, the prevailing personality is that of David O. Russell.
24021	4	a	The Prestige gets to be a bit of a grind after a while, despite all the finery and the elegantly detailed atmosphere.
24022	2	a	Safe entertainment and a visually impressive piece of work.
24023	3	a	Extremely well-made, ably acted, beautifully shot and has a plot full of hairpin turns and twists. It is an entirely engaging and occasionally gripping film. It is also completely unnecessary.
24024	6	a	The Extra Man not only gilds the flower, but then glues on sequins and forces it into cha-cha heels.
24025	2	a	"Despite McDonagh's cinematic hyperbole, it's the strength of the performances from McDormand, Harrelson and Rockwell that keeps ""Three Billboards"" sturdily anchored in a compellingly rendered reality."
24026	1	a	Tommy Lee Jones combines forces with the Coen Brothers in the unforgiving winds of the West Texas prairie. Javier Barden's psycho-killer and the Coens' creepy direction and screenwriting pops out the grittiest film of the year.
24027	1	a	There are certain times in a filmmaker's career when everything comes together in a kind of perfect storm ... For Gus Van Sant, Paranoid Park is that film.
24028	3	a	Gondry's biggest success is recognising that superheroes can still be funny, and embracing that in every part of this film.
24029	3	a	A great deal more fun than most Oscar hopefuls allow themselves to be. Think Goodfellas, but with bad comb-overs. And perms. And yards of corduroy and crushed velour. 
24030	1	a	Tailor made for Spielberg with an adventurous heart and an accessible screenplay.
24031	4	a	Base on a book and Broadway play, the movie is still too theatrical due to Da Costa's mediocre helming, but it's a great, campy and colorful showcase for comedienne Rosalind Russell in her best-known role which she had originated on stage.
24032	3	a	The Savages is a precious, pitch-perfect little film that finds humanity and mirth in the darkest of places.
24033	9	a	Astro Boy provides all of the elements needed to create a super hero movie, but it lacks soul.
24034	1	a	Ultimately its sheer archness reveals Paul Schrader as a gifted and deeply persuasive evangelist of the transcendental style - if not quite a canon saint.
24035	3	a	Bee sure to see this.
24036	3	a	Is it sentimental? Of course, but never unbearably so thanks to the director's delicate touch.
24037	0	a	Relentless and intense, with characters that are the accurate realizations of their behaviors and special effects that dwarf the limits of the time.
24038	5	a	So-so sitcom-like story of estranged movie stars.
24039	3	a	I'll admit that a lot of people are going to describe it as a waste of time, yet there's a likeability to the quirky characters that held my interest while tickling my funny bone.
24040	6	a	A cacophony of sights and sounds and a disjointed narrative dilute the message.
24041	3	a	A crazed, playful, defiantly twisted collision of alternate realities.
24042	3	a	There's no denying that it's pretty vicious humour, and pretty puerile too, but like previously successful purveyors of such past-the-U-bend comedy, its fresh-faced enthusiasm makes it invulnerable to... tired accusations.
24043	6	a	"Half of the humor goes into the ""how could they possibly have thought that was funny?"" file."
24044	3	a	Funny at times, but also deeply sad, it's a truly fascinating and well made documentary.
24045	6	a	"High school volleyball is not an exciting sport to watch on a big screen. At least not the way ""Miracle"" director Sean McNamara presents it."
24046	8	a	The story and dialogue are funny and striking; the costumes exceptional; the ambience superb. Wilson, Cotillard, and Stoll give award-quality performances.
24047	2	a	A highly stylized fable, a combination creep-show and pitch-black comedy that steadily builds to an almost hallucinatory climax.
24048	6	a	Feel free to Honk if you love Huckabees, but don't be surprised if the person sitting next to you flips you the existential bird through their inner moon roof.
24049	4	a	Too bad the dazzling 'eye candy' technology was wasted on such a trivial pursuit.
24050	4	a	How Do You Know isn't Brooks' best. Witherspoon is too uneasy in her role. But thanks to Rudd, plus Kathryn Hahn as... George's loyal secretary and Nicholson as his father, it delivers a number of delights.
24051	3	a	At times, the narrative seems to be taking a somewhat roundabout route, but patience is rewarded, since this is elegant, perverse and provocative.
24052	4	a	Proves to be a pleasant romp.
24053	8	a	Ugh. Just ugh.
24054	2	a	David O. Russell is screwing with us. He's seeing how many indie rom-com tropes he can juggle at the same time and still make it work, with one big twist: Brad Cooper is the Manic Pixie Dream Girl with a penis.
24055	6	a	A Million Ways to Die moseys unmercifully through a plot whose length can't sustain its comic invention although once in a while it leaps to a kind of demented life.
24056	2	a	The concepts in this film are not terribly new, but they are effectively presented.
24057	9	a	These people are without exception awful, selfish and dull.
24058	4	a	Much as I like Melissa McCarthy, this aimless road movie misfires. And when is Hollywood going to let a plus-sized woman be not only sexual but erotic?
24059	6	a	A superficial but entertaining roller coaster ride of nonstop action.
24060	4	a	The film is unusually gripping.
24061	0	a	Newcomers to Ozu must be prepared for a rigidly controlled work with no mobile-camera shots. This style elegantly frames the delicate performances, which in turn do justice to the wisdom and compassion of Ozu's view of life.
24062	1	a	Tough and taciturn, Craig has re-energized the franchise after the shaky Brosnan years, definitely demonstrating that the series has once again earned its license to thrill.
24063	4	a	This dark, brooding family melodrama, set against the context of Brooklyn's Russian-Jewish mob, is well acted by Tim Roth, Maximillian Schell, Vanessa Redgrave, and Edward Furlong.
24064	1	a	Rest assured, this film is one long joke on the audience, and anyone who watches it with the notion that he might understand it completely is either ponderously full of himself or sadly mistaken.
24065	3	a	What Linklater has captured is a generation of bristling minds unable to turn their thoughts into action.
24066	8	a	Dismal...Lots of things get stolen in 'Identity Thief,' but the biggest heist is of the hundred minutes you'll lose forever watching it.
24067	7	a	The humor is constantly based on a surreal sarcasm, in nonesense, strange behaviour, and to make things worse, slapstick. [Full review in Spanish]
24068	6	a	Nick Nolte is excellent in Keith Gordon's ambitious but flawed adaptation of Vonnegut's fascinating novel.
24069	3	a	Outrageously enjoyable...turns the genre conventions on their head to often uproarious effect.
24070	3	a	The strange marriage is conservatively boxed - as a director Eastwood is a master craftsman, but no visionary - but oddly effective.
24071	3	a	Intelligent and moving.
24072	5	a	A film where the concept came first and the script -- and everything else -- seems to have finished a poor second.
24073	3	a	While there isn't much new terrain here, what distinguishes Carter is the quality and richness of what they extract from the soil. 
24074	1	a	"In Payne films, as in the films of Jean Renoir, there are no ""goodies"" or ""baddies""; everyone has their reasons, and that makes his work distinctly different from most mainstream American films these days."
24075	5	a	After a while you find yourself giggling uncontrollably as Paltrow lurches through her scenes.
24076	4	a	Robustly embodies the cathartic pleasures of shared scared silliness.
24077	10	a	The cinematography and sound work are mediocre, but still far better than the material deserves: you can still see and hear what's happening on the screen.
24078	3	a	As observational satire, it lacks the outcast verve that comes with real outrage.
24079	4	a	Not since Rocky worked out in a meat locker has Sylvester Stallone surrounded himself with so much aging beef.
24080	5	a	... characters are as thin and unengaging as the animation is sleek and shiny.
24081	5	a	If you liked the first Ted film, which launched Seth MacFarlane's potty-mouthed teddy, you may still find the second offensive, not because of its daft man-child humour, but its ill-judged attempt at comic racism.
24082	9	a	... the whistleblower's journey asks for emotional complexity Neeson and this generally starchy script can't find.
24083	3	a	The Curious Case of Benjamin Button shows that whether we live life forwards or backwards, the outside is just a shell and it's what we choose to do with life that sifts out the best parts from the worst.
24084	6	a	While Alpha Dog is a cautionary tale, it too often revels in its own bad-boy attitude.
24085	2	a	Miranda Richardson was the best thing about this film.
24086	7	a	This is just another boxing movie with few surprises and an awkward message to viewers.
24087	5	a	Mullett mediocrity.
24088	7	a	sticks to the rules of too many lame sitcoms and unfunny comedies past, which the doomed actors follow like lemmings off a cliff
24089	6	a	If you can get past the agitated visual gimmicks, there's just enough mystery to sink your teeth in to.
24090	6	a	READY PLAYER ONE is the prime example of just how hollow big budget filmmaking has become and ranks as one of the worst movies Spielberg has ever made, even though it represents an amalgamation of what has made his movies so iconic.
24091	2	a	There's a bit more life flowing underneath the surface, providing depth to a viewing experience that, at times, certainly comes across as a Travel Channel pilot.
24092	5	a	There follows much groping and fondling and talk of debauchery, all of it slightly less erotic than integral calculus.
24093	6	a	apt to provide a slight, delectable buzz but little nutritional value
24094	3	a	SoaP is everything its cracked up to be and more, a monster movie and disaster flick rolled into one
24095	3	a	The novelty of [Greenwald's] premise, and its essential humanity, shine through the sermonizing.
24096	9	a	A seriously bad film with seriously warped logic by writer-director Kurt Wimmer at the screenplay level.
24097	3	a	The plot is, likes its characters, a master of misdirection
24098	3	a	A whimsical winner in which everybody seems to be having a blast.
24099	3	a	Silly, profane and, on its own explicitly stated terms, very nearly perfect.
24100	1	a	. . . a dark, heart-wrenching masterpiece from British director Ken Loach . . .
24101	1	a	It's the clarity with which Jenkins sees it that makes the film extraordinary.
24102	4	a	Mangold certainly knew what he was doing when he cast Keitel and De Niro.
24103	2	a	Spiritual on the one hand and street tough on the other - a cross between The Jewish Sopranos and Six Feet Under And Kosher.
24104	4	a	DiCaprio and Winslet channel much nuance into their home-based hell. Mendes' level-headed helming is best at pinpointing the brutality of banality, while Roger Deakins' lush cinematography stylises suburbia as a lavish velvet coffin for its residents.
24105	3	a	McDonagh doesn't make easily consumable films, but this is definitely his hardest sell to date; if you can stomach it, you're in for a dark, uncomfortable treat that you'll still be debating long after awards season has wrapped.
24106	2	a	It's a prime example of socialists trying to act like Charlie Chaplin over slapstick satire.
24107	3	a	The whole affair is utterly charming, and I had a lot of fun with Roth's first foray into kid-centric genre fare.
24108	0	a	Even without the musical numbers, von Trier has given us a compelling story with original characters.
24109	6	a	The film's ethos clashes with Jessica Alba's tan lines and loses the battle.
24110	3	a	"Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri"" is just the bitter pill the times call for, offered with a loving cup to make it go down just a bit easier."
24111	6	a	This year's contender for most mediocre Best Picture nominee.
24112	2	a	...not so much a laugh riot as it is an affable romp.
24113	5	a	It's a curious, often lifeless film that has something to say and at times, almost makes a point or two, but too often it meanders awkwardly and Lee's decision to shoot it in this way only serves to show up the inadequacies even more.
24114	5	a	Somewhere between the cheesy special effects and lame story the whole movie falls flat.
24115	3	a	"The art of a great con is that the victim never sees it coming. This is where ""Matchstick Men"" falls flat on its face."
24116	5	a	Man of the Year pretends to reach for a steak knife and draws a plastic spoon instead.
24117	1	a	McDonagh knows how to get good characters into a story but not always how to get them out of it. This time he's considerably more focused, letting McDormand's ferocious mother-bear of a performance, her best since Fargo, drive the narrative.
24118	3	a	While it may be about as subtle as a swinging sledgehammer, it does leave its mark.
24119	0	a	It was Hawks' genius to recognize a kinship between his leads, and to understand that the 'naturalism' of the Wayne persona was as deep and complex as the more intellectualized approach of the neurotic young New York stage actor, Clift.
24120	7	a	The Darkest Minds is badly edited and lacks a cohesive flow. Readers of the book will know the setup, but it's a head scratcher for us neophytes.
24121	6	a	Some colorful character turns cannot make up for the charisma void at the center that is Martin.
24122	9	a	I, Frankenstein? More like Oy, Frakenstein.
24123	3	a	It's the Sideways of the Something About Mary subgenre, a raunchy cartoon laughfest that takes its emotional issues dead seriously.
24124	5	a	Theron gives a powerful, chameleon-like performance in this disturbing but very sad film that shows how harsh the world can seem to people living on the fringe of society.
24125	2	a	As a look at two women who find an unusual connection, it's rather beautiful.
24126	0	a	An uproariously frank treatment of pregnancy and adulthood. Movies about family chaos are generally the province of PG-rated Steve Martin comedies, which makes the raw candor of Apatow's film not only refreshing, but more honest in its sentiment.
24127	9	a	The animation is lazy at best, haphazard at worst and pretty much nondescript all the way through.
24128	0	a	Hold on tight, because it starts at full throttle and never lets up.
24129	5	a	...loud and violent, if not annoying.
24130	4	a	jets past moral qualms and cuts right into our most feverish sense of righteousness
24131	6	a	The Infiltrator may be inspired by true events, but it's still a generic crime drama.
24132	3	a	A compelling piece of propaganda.
24133	3	a	Good, but not great Allen film.
24134	0	a	[Coppola] gives us a film so poignant, so funny, so free of self-satisfied bravado, that one can't help but look forward to her next work.
24135	3	a	What you really get here is the same movie all over again -- only more so.
24136	6	a	At a loss for what to do while I was sitting there, I wondered why Depp would agree to play the role in a hairdo inspired by Carrot Top.
24137	5	a	Allen's schtick is a jabbermouth know-it-all.
24138	0	a	Two decades later, Heathers is so on the money, with its vague but unmistakable parallels to several school shootings, that it could never be made today.
24139	5	a	The result isn't deadly dull, but it does turn what should have been a most dangerous game into a basic scenery-chewing contest.
24140	7	a	While it's too pleasant to be irritating, it's also too lackadaisical to be truly funny.
24141	4	a	Much of the charm of this film is in its understanding of the great fluidity of romantic relationships -- especially before people decide to settle down.
24142	8	a	Prince has had his follies, but never has he been associated with an album or film as lackluster as this one.
24143	6	a	Billy Lynn's Long Halftime Walk is a well-intentioned misfire that cannot live up to its higher aspirations.
24144	5	a	Gross-out, juvenile, misogynistic, racist, homophobic, marijuana-philic, oh-no-they-didn't jokes, pretending to be comedy. 
24145	9	a	A catastrophe of incomprehensible nonsense, The Predator is a god-awful mess that's as loud and pointless as cinema gets.
24146	9	a	A grim and dreary failure.
24147	6	a	This is derivative melodrama with Spielberg hedging his bets by ripping off his previous adventure films to lighten a story that cries out not to be turned into a comic book.
24148	4	a	Three Billboards doesn't exactly fall apart, but too many implausible turns and uncomfortable gags impede the hitherto smooth machinery.
24149	3	a	There's only one monarch mentioned in the title of Valentino: The Last Emperor. But Matt Tyrnauer's breezy and entertaining look inside the world of high fashion is very much a two-man show.
24150	9	a	An absolute landmark in schlockisity.
24151	9	a	If you think it's a riot to see Rob Schneider in a young woman's clothes, then you'll enjoy The Hot Chick.
24152	0	a	This movie disappeared without a trace at the American box office in October last year, which is a shame.
24153	4	a	Sweet story of a shy girl and a seal.
24154	3	a	It's Ronan, as well as Margot Robbie in an arresting turn as a wretched but wily Elizabeth, who keeps us watching even as the twists in Mary's narrative become increasingly, almost maddeningly complicated.
24155	5	a	[O]nce you get over your initial sense of awe at the special effects, you're left with the feeling that you're being hit over the head repeatedly.
24156	3	a	This film finds the Finn at his sunniest and most accessible.
24157	9	a	The film quickly settles into a depressingly one-note groove as a culture-clashing circus act.
24158	4	a	The heavy-handed ideology and flawed narration don't commend Arctic Tale as a movie I would care to watch repeatedly, but I'm glad I saw it once, for the spectacular photography.
24159	4	a	An unnerving film about the twin perils of intolerance and silence.
24160	2	a	A decent film based on a pretty dopey idea, it enchants by leaving you to wonder if all the discursive elements are eventually going to add up to something.
24161	3	a	With Land of the Dead, Romero has created his personal masterpiece, an incredibly gruesome film, but with thought-provoking concepts and surprising resonance.
24162	4	a	Ultimately dragged on for too long.
24163	9	a	The movie has no suspense, no sense of how Jolie's destiny affects her and absolutely no connection to life or anything like it.
24164	9	a	Very boring and earthbound entertainment for the children.
24165	6	a	Funny, but simultaneously trying to do too much and too little.
24166	5	a	Spews noxious gas and obnoxious patter.
24167	3	a	It's the work of a director firmly in control of his subject and shows that - when he wants to - there are few subjects that he can't tackle with flair.
24168	4	a	A beautifully shot, hyper-violent, post-apocalyptic Twin Peaks car movie starring a mud-caked murderous road hobo that either needs to be more articulate or more absurd, but sort of gets caught in between. 
24169	3	a	The pleasures are small but intense and the spell cast in one of the most surprisingly moving films of the year is captivating.
24170	3	a	Birdman of Alcatraz is a quiet, contemplative work by a great director just as he's starting to work at the top of his game. It features some of the era's best black and white cinematography and a career-best performance by a screen legend.
24171	8	a	This kind of massive failure of industry and imagination saddens me to no end.
24172	3	a	An unflinchingly ugly -- but downright mesmerizing -- tale that plumbs the depths of human immorality.
24173	4	a	A powerful piece of filmmaking. Gere and Foster are as immaculate as always.
24174	4	a	For the devious bad guy's creative and unsettling garb alone, Girls Nite Out earns more points than it otherwise probably warrants.
24175	4	a	Too long
24176	3	a	At first glance, Inherent Vice might seem to be a detective story. Look a little closer, however, and it becomes clear that this is Paul Thomas Anderson's idea of a comedy.
24177	1	a	"Prestige biopics don't get much better than ""The Imitation Game."" This is a special film."
24178	4	a	The filmmakers take a great yarn and reduce it to a good one.
24179	4	a	The route to the climax - or anticlimax - needs more roadside attractions.
24180	3	a	Johnston is surprisingly good at generating suspense and maintaining the tension of lengthy action sequences
24181	2	a	It's not a perfect film by any means, but it certainly succeeds quite well in telling its tale with enough charm and gore to keep thing interesting.
24182	2	a	Nicolas Cage is out of his mind in The Bad Lieutenant: Port of Call -- New Orleans. And it's wonderful to see.
24183	0	a	This suspenseful drama reveals pieces of its puzzle steadily and slowly, until the final heartrending picture can be seen at last.
24184	5	a	I might almost sit through the crappy storytelling one more time just to see the car chases. These are the kind car chases that Stuntman Mike from Death Proof might be able to appreciate
24185	4	a	"A sleeper for senior citizens, this year's ""Best Exotic Marigold Hotel."
24186	4	a	Like the bulk of the story, the movie itself just seems to be marking time, waiting for someone to take charge.
24187	6	a	It's one of those films that's so terrible that it somehow is appealing to those who like B-film clunkers.
24188	3	a	Moody and full of atmosphere, this film has a terrific premise, but no plot to speak of. It's an intriguing character study, beautifully filmed and acted but ultimately somewhat empty.
24189	6	a	Why Kat must be so emotionally clueless or her sister so selfish is a mystery that invites an essay about what women think of each other these days.
24190	8	a	The title suggests a choice Mike Binder's movie will make for you, stacking the deck with half the cards.... contains all the racial insight of a Madea farce.
24191	3	a	Gay Paree just bubbled up a few degrees with this delightfully witty homo-faux-bic comedy.
24192	4	a	...had me holding my hands over my eyes for the first time since Natalie Portman did horrible things to her cuticles in Black Swan.
24193	3	a	Enjoyably pulpy Southern-fried thriller with a strong script and terrific performances from a superb cast, though it occasionally struggles to escape its stage-bound origins.
24194	3	a	You should get your kicks from the Fockers.
24195	4	a	Preminger seems happier with long transition shots of the Hawaiian Islands and military class ships than it does with creating rhythm in the film's narrative.
24196	4	a	Events veer between tragedy and comedy, often within a scene, at times within a single sentence.
24197	5	a	Its very premise is enough to have you reaching for the remote after ten minutes unless you're in the mood for breasts, dirty jokes and male chauvinism.
24198	3	a	The Roman costume drama, all dressed to the IX's, has taken a long holiday from the big screen.
24199	0	a	Aniston was brave to accept this dark role, which may win her an Oscar nomination and certainly proves she's an actress of substance.
24200	2	a	Somewhat sanitized and over-directed biopic saved by Boseman's electric performance.
24201	4	a	Historically, The Awful Truth is probably most significant as the film that secured Grant's star, forcing him to adopt his famously relaxed persona through McCarey's improvisational approach to filming.
24202	5	a	In A Million Ways to Die in the West, director-star Seth MacFarlane builds an imposing, affectionate reconstruction of the American movie West, then defaces it with funny mustaches -- often literally.
24203	7	a	An embarrassment to a genre that's already delivered some of the worst movies of the last ten years.
24204	0	a	It is the epitome of filmmaking, a masterpiece for which Welles, one of the greatest practitioners of the cinematic art, will be forever remembered.
24205	4	a	The story is never as interesting as the choices made by the actresses or their characters.
24206	6	a	"This ""'Break-Up"" is, unfortunately, hard to do."
24207	2	a	A gritty urban crime drama involving teenagers, guns, drugs and sex, all sharply acted, well-directed and astutely put together
24208	3	a	A film that reminds us that old people were once young, and that their youthful passions and dreams are still at play behind the wrinkles.
24209	3	a	Funny, fascinating and entirely heart-warming. Spoil your Mum. Spoil yourself.
24210	3	a	Methodical, riveting and emotionally charged.
24211	6	a	Such a volatile presence needs control, and director Peter Sehr doesn't fine-tune either the character or the performance enough to keep it from burning out and self-destructing.
24212	4	a	No surprises, but plenty of laughs and gasps.
24213	2	a	When the film clicks, it's because Herzog has populated it with mostly non-actors he stumbled across in the midst of filming.
24214	2	a	First time feature writer/director Maggie Carey has crafted a genuinely funny and refreshing female teen sex comedy.
24215	3	a	A meaningful love note to a man, his obsessions, and the toll they took on those closest to him while the world watched in wonder.
24216	1	a	A profound study of an all-too-common human condition.
24217	4	a	A fine performance from Fanny Ardant elevates Marion Vernoux's intriguing if rarely riveting study of late-life passion.
24218	6	a	Seinfeld, what happened? You've gone soft on us. Sure, some of it is fun but where's the sting?
24219	3	a	Enjoyable whizz through a chapter of musical history, with a terrific soundtrack and great performances across the board.
24220	1	a	Nothing has dimmed its visceral impact. And likely nothing will.
24221	6	a	The main interest here is the acting, which is, by turns, entertaining or just entertainingly bad, with lots of grungy seriousness and Method-trained twitching, but also some moments of real gusto.
24222	5	a	attempts to take the admittedly addicting soap opera that was the book and elevate into something on a higher plane of artistic existence. It fails.
24223	4	a	It's great to hear a person no longer with us captured so bountifully in interviews, talking and even bubbling about his friends, his legacy and his scrapes.
24224	4	a	"John Carter"" may not be a perfect movie, but it's one where you can safely plunk down your money, grab your box of popcorn and come away reasonably satisfied when the closing credits roll."
24225	1	a	A technical milestone.
24226	6	a	Overall the film's a long play of a video game barely propped up by plot and stock personalities.
24227	4	a	Almost all highlights and bombast, with little if any room for subtlety or poetry.
24228	1	a	"The beauty of ""Love, Simon"" is in its astute, slice-of-life observances about family, friendship, and that delicate moment in every LGBTQ person's life when he or she must gather the courage to begin living as their authentic self."
24229	4	a	A fun and completely amiable precursor to the upcoming onslaught of Summer movies.
24230	2	a	One of the more clever conceits is how it plays with the central conundrum of Pixar: How do you connect all these animals or toys or robots-beings that, to humans, have no emotions or thoughts or even faces-to the human world that they walk around in?
24231	4	a	Even geeks enjoy poking fun at geeks. And they really know how.
24232	3	a	I wanted [Buddy and Abby] to become lovers, which means they sold me on themselves.
24233	4	a	a jumbled and largely uninteresting mess
24234	4	a	Samuel L. Jackson plays the real-life coach of a high school basketball team in this solid, unsurprising sports drama.
24235	4	a	George Cukor conjures up an oppressive atmosphere... But it's not quite enough to cover up the script's yawning gaps in logic.
24236	0	a	lush, poetic and soulful
24237	6	a	A formulaic romantic comedy that never quite makes up for in charm what it lacks in originality.
24238	4	a	Mr. Bakshi's allegory is fairly obvious from the outset, but he and his animators are convincingly professional. They have devised a melange of animation and live footage that gives their feature mystical, slightly scary and, occasionally, comic tones.
24239	1	a	A brilliantly conceived romantic comedy reversal that turns the genre on its head.
24240	9	a	I admit to having chuckled once; that's why the movie gets a generous one star instead of none.
24241	0	a	Director Frank Capra's perennial plum.
24242	1	a	Bale's achievement is in suggesting far more dimensions than his character would ever admit to having.
24243	4	a	Much of what makes Hannibal Lecter so frightening is the unfathomable gulf between the hypercivilized exterior and the ferocious, bloodthirsty beast beneath the refined mask of sanity. To explain his diseased mind is to rob the character of its mystery.
24244	4	a	A message that never gets old: On stage or in high-school hallways, sometime it's the losers that turn out to be the real winners.
24245	2	a	About a third of Team America exhibits deliriously trashy bad taste, but most of the rest is just tasteless to the point of being infantile.
24246	3	a	Just when you think you have Goldberg figured, he springs fresh surprises.
24247	4	a	A quiet, personal story that should have been louder, bolder.
24248	0	a	Theron digs so deep into her doomed character that it's impossible not to feel empathy.
24249	3	a	You're more or less bound to have a blast watching it, that is, if you don't take any of it seriously.
24250	1	a	Michael Collins is a brilliant epic tale whose implications are felt even today.
24251	9	a	[A] wonderful pile of stench.
24252	4	a	There are enough laughs to make it worth a look for Allen's legion of fans.
24253	3	a	Within [his] off-kilter sensibility, there has always been a Zenlike simplicity and elegance, and that aspect of Jarmusch's work reaches full fruition in Ghost Dog.
24254	6	a	But too often in It Comes at Night, no genuine shocks or cathartic release wait at the end of each taut thread. Instead, it's just deeper and deeper mystery.
24255	5	a	One more run around that boringly realised, CGI-reliant, blue-grey netherverse that takes enduring fantasy creations as the basis for barely functioning multiplex-filler.
24256	1	a	'Nebraska' is in love with its characters. By the end, so is the audience.
24257	4	a	Redgrave is radiant as the woman who is hoping for a romantic miracle.
24258	2	a	The budget on the film must have been pretty small, because they sure did make us leave a lot to our imaginations.
24259	4	a	The film is more of a generic action-fantasy based on a graphic novel, rather than the book by Mary Shelley, so don't expect it to be emotionally moving. 
24260	1	a	A film this heartfelt and intelligent about social justice will never be unimportant, but it feels especially relevant today.
24261	5	a	The stars have zero chemistry and the movie is none too thrilling.
24262	3	a	Into the Wild is especially memorable in the manner in which it offers no absolutes.
24263	0	a	Masterpiece? I'd hazard to say so, for as much of what it says to what it leaves to the viewer.
24264	3	a	A sure delight for both guys and gals.
24265	1	a	Reality wounds but also heals in The Savages, writer-director Tamara Jenkins' cuttingly funny-sad family drama.
24266	2	a	I was devastated by it. What bothers me is this: It is the easiest thing in the world to do... move people by destroying something beautiful.
24267	3	a	A portrait of a neighborhood where families are hurting, healing and helping each other.
24268	0	a	It's a King-size role for this terrific actor.
24269	4	a	Writer/director Borte plumbs the primordial ooze of our collective unconscious, that emotional sinkhole where all our stuff gets stuffed -- giving us a look at the empty, albeit high-priced, suit.
24270	3	a	Don Cheadle has elevated yet another film: Talk to Me is better than it intends to be. But thank Ejiofor as well.
24271	9	a	A mediocre and lackluster comedy with Jonathan Winters providing the only funny moments.
24272	6	a	Crimson Peak is a visually stunning movie of little substance.
24273	6	a	For all the characters' talk of second-act surprises and red herrings, the observant will have no trouble seeing writer/director David Twohey's breadcrumb trail of hints.
24274	4	a	A cliched and frequently stodgy affair...pales in comparison to [Corbjin's] previous effort, or indeed, other recent le Carre adaptations.
24275	5	a	It's a flimsily sketched psychological sci-fi movie that never feels more than being robotic.
24276	4	a	Refreshing and in other ways deeply frustrating.
24277	5	a	Oscar-winning director Ang Lee's latest film aims to shine a light on the hypocrisy faced by returning war veterans in America, but it falters in tone and emotional impact.
24278	7	a	Not a bad premise, but most of the comedy just dies. Hard.
24279	4	a	Even hostile invasions need a bit more character and plot development.
24280	3	a	Brewer has a great affection for his characters and a good feel for the Tennessee slums and backwoods where he sets his stories. But he's also got a B-moviemaker's impertinence and love of button-pushing.
24281	8	a	This one's for die-hard genre fans only. And even then, it's only good to snicker at the obvious cliches and overall predictablity.
24282	6	a	A broad-based lampoon that envelops too much material and tries far too hard to please.
24283	3	a	Hoffman brings a balance of fierce obsession and weary resignation to the role, and ends on a howling note that's so deeply human it brings shivers.
24284	5	a	Miami Vice is a dark, grainy and heavy drama and so super-serious and smoky thick it could be called Miasma Vice.
24285	6	a	It feels like a missed opportunity, but perhaps is a blessing since Bandslam's dialogue is much more pat than Hughes's quotable writing.
24286	4	a	Willis makes a convincing villain
24287	4	a	The frequent chronological jumps ... give a sense that the director is assembling a puzzle in which half the pieces are missing.
24288	3	a	During a time in which wall-to-wall pop culture references have become the standard in animated family fare, it's refreshing to find not a single drop of irony here.
24289	4	a	Like a less oppressively hip Juno, Bandslam captures the way young people too smart and pop-culture-savvy for their own good let the music and movies they love define them during adolescence's crucible of humiliation and self-doubt.
24290	6	a	... the film lurches more often than it launches.
24291	4	a	Coming out of the theater, not only are you three hours older than you were when you went in, but you get the sense that your too-human flesh is also that much closer to obsolete.
24292	3	a	An Absolutely riveting movie...Pitt is outstanding
24293	6	a	If the makers hadn't stuck so closely to the rules, this film would have been far more engaging.
24294	2	a	Waking up to the struggles of others, especially those closest to us, can prove to be challenging, and it is this process - and the movement forward - that drives the film.
24295	4	a	Near on par with the original...Sweet, Funny, Memorable
24296	6	a	There's an overly familiar feel to all of it. We have been here before.
24297	2	a	At its best, The Savages captures the lunacy that comes with coping with sorrow.
24298	3	a	Hoffman's last leading role is it own kind of spy film
24299	1	a	It has great dialogue and superb stunts and fight sequences.
24300	2	a	I love that Bruce Dern's Woody does not fall into the depths of codger-cliche.
24301	1	a	This is a vastly superior movie, capturing all the things that I felt were missing from the first.
24302	0	a	What's fascinating about Carol is how Haynes and his performers create a sophisticated story about two people trying to be together in an environment that's quietly suffocating them. 
24303	3	a	Director Gary David Goldberg has said he gave the script to Cusack to add his own touches, resulting in some clever and engaging repartee with Diane Lane, another intelligent and likable actor.
24304	8	a	Three of Hollywood's most beautiful and talented actresses, Ryan, Keaton, and Kudrow, are totally wasted in this shamelessly sappy meller that bears the schmaltzy sensibility of Nora Ephorn, its inept producer and co-scripter even though Keaton is helmer
24305	5	a	Degenerates into sub-Heavy Metal carnage.
24306	3	a	This extremely clever documentary explores the power of the media through a remarkably unsettling case study: namely, Italy. Not only is the situation there pretty frightening, but it has implications for every other media-obsessed nation.
24307	6	a	A snazzy-looking mixed bag. Kids will be diverted, adults will tolerate it, and all involved will be expecting something more imaginative than what Jerry Seinfeld has whittled together.
24308	4	a	Red Planet convincingly demonstrates that the shadow side of science is scary - very scary indeed.
24309	5	a	The biggest problem is a lack of any overarching reason why this was the story to tell about Grahame
24310	0	a	"Among the finest of the screwball ""comedies of remarriage,"" The Awful Truth showcases Grant and Dunne at their most winning."
24311	3	a	A smart, satirical, and expertly animated adventure aimed at adults and children alike.
24312	4	a	A far funnier movie than the original
24313	5	a	The film naturally has its share of gruesome moments, but it's also surprisingly dull and uninvolving.
24314	3	a	Wright/Frost/Pegg present a screwball Sci-fi comedy
24315	3	a	A comedy that works for the most part while in other sections has the audience waiting for a TV laugh track that doesn't come.
24316	3	a	With great pizzazz, Fincher's creative team's original style wrings suspense from the aspects that are a pastiche of other thrillers.
24317	1	a	"The Artist"" drags, as any film telling its story with its mouth and ears tied behind its back can be expected to. But it's a lovely bit of froth, the meringue on a cinema season that is both high-minded and awards oriented."
24318	4	a	The Artist plays less like an original take on the early sound era than as fan fiction set in the world of Singin' in the Rain.
24319	1	a	A first-rate thriller that plays out with the pluck and style of the best James Bond films.
24320	4	a	A pleasing, cliche-averse, stereotype defying tale of mismatched teens in odd-couple love.
24321	6	a	"A disposable trifle of fleeting rewards that - like many a feature built around a ""Saturday Night Live"" sketch - shows its seams after three minutes."
24322	3	a	Mystic River explores the quirks of fate that make us who and what we are.
24323	3	a	"A more accurate title would have been ""The Fantastic Two and the Other Two, Not So Much."
24324	9	a	Eat Pray Love is a long marathon full of self pity and poor interaction.
24325	8	a	The gifted Josh Brolin is totally wasted in this misguided, messy, disjointed and tedious action-adventure-western
24326	9	a	It's being billed as an adult drama, but beware: Darling Companion is a ponderous film with very little charm and a snail's pace.
24327	3	a	All in all, Rango is a freaky and fun ride, with some tasty philosophical asides and references for the grownups to chew on. 
24328	0	a	It's like nothing you've ever seen before, and it sets a great tone that takes you places you've never been before.
24329	1	a	"Moore has been a fine actress for a long time and ""Still Alice"" gives her a remarkable role, and the space to truly live it."
24330	6	a	A touching, tender love story and a respectful, fully cinematic biography of an underappreciated talent, whose scandalous tastes eclipsed her star power.
24331	1	a	Half Star Wars and half Classics Illustrated, Disney's Treasure Planet is a total blast, filled with animation dazzle and imaginative storytelling.
24332	10	a	Perhaps a productive use for Daddy Day Camp may be found among death row inmates who wish to make their final minutes feel like weeks.
24333	3	a	Enthralling history unveiled in this well-acted film 
24334	6	a	The result is a movie -- about a father's futile willingness to sacrifice everything for his daughter -- that evokes practically no emotion.
24335	0	a	One of this year's best films.
24336	4	a	Evoking the era through period detail and occasional footage, director Bertrand Bonello has created a cautionary tale about the price of fame and celebrity.
24337	6	a	In the fleeting third act, The Perfect Score hints at what could have been. Unfortunately, its improvements arrive too little, too late.
24338	4	a	The picture's beauty and Cameron's amazing photographic work provide much pleasure. It's just that...there is the feeling we've been there and seen it all before.
24339	2	a	Gripping cancer drama.
24340	6	a	The script comes across as a misogynistic mess and the performance, although consistently good, can't overcome the diluted material.
24341	6	a	But for its faults as a movie, the story is still compelling as a bit of history, and more so in the midst of a presidential administration that at times seems to be taking all the wrong lessons from Nixon.
24342	3	a	Cornish and Whishaw give powerful, unforgettable performances, with Cornish assured of an Oscar nomination. Other cast members, such as Schneider and Kerry Fox as Fanny's mother, make the film even stronger.
24343	4	a	An overly literal idea of the brilliant director, but an entertaining visit to the set of a horror classic.
24344	3	a	Itchy and Scratchy and Houdini
24345	5	a	It's twinged with requisite boo scares, void of deeply complicated twists and often haphazard with basic logic.
24346	6	a	Decent, but innocuous and offering nary a surprise or unexpected plot or character development, this romantic comedy doesn't possess enough of either obligatory element to appeal to anyone beyond diehard aficionados of the genre.
24347	4	a	It's no barrel of laughs, but there are flashes of humour to lighten the load.
24348	4	a	Moody coming-of-age drama has sex, drinking, language.
24349	3	a	Both lead performances are extraordinary.
24350	4	a	Epic WWII production plays like star-studded soap opera at times.
24351	5	a	Whether your nine-year-old niece will care about that is moot - but she'll definitely resent the poor ratio of musical numbers to clunky, contrived emotional scenes.
24352	3	a	...a precariously balanced movie, one that flirts with smugness. That it isn't awful is in some respects amazing. 
24353	3	a	But though some of the emotions portrayed are fake, Paper Heart ultimately is a heartfelt film that wears its sincerity on its sleeve.
24354	4	a	It would be hard to mount a straight-faced defense of Brisseau's feverish moral tale, complete with a lurking angel of death, but the carnal machinations are hugely entertaining -- particularly if you like your skin with a bracing sermon chaser.
24355	2	a	Significant credit goes to these committed actors, who are forced to give speeches and make choices regularly at odds with authentic human behavior.
24356	9	a	Strange Wilderness is so wretched that it makes The Benchwarmers look like Bull Durham, Grandma's Boy look like The Graduate, and Deuce Bigalow: Male Gigolo look like Midnight Cowboy.
24357	6	a	While all the pieces are there for an intriguing film, John Maybury's The Edge of Love never really becomes anything.
24358	1	a	...a film that's custom-built to combine the swift horsepower of characters we like with the stylish chrome of fresh changes is a welcome pleasure. 
24359	4	a	Fun, funny, Chick Lit-style chortler.
24360	6	a	Inspired visuals and fluid animation, even blown up on IMAX, weren't enough to prevent me from being bored out of my skull.
24361	4	a	The Joneses never makes it into full on satire but is smart and clear enough in its setup not to have to spell out a message in some soapy conclusion.
24362	1	a	Grim, often hilarious, and consistently thought-provoking... McDormand and Rockwell have never been better.
24363	5	a	Is this thrilling to anyone?
24364	6	a	The story, acting and visual effects fail to effectively blend together into a coherent sci-fi adventure.
24365	2	a	Turning a great movie into a pretty good one is still a step in the wrong direction... and The Ring will never be more than a pretty good movie.
24366	1	a	All in all the movie delivers what you expect but not in the way that you expect it, which makes it work as both a long-delayed fourth chapter in Veronica's story and a rare big-screen version of a TV show ...
24367	8	a	The hooded phantom who keeps popping up to shove passengers onto the tracks is the only figure in Kontroll with even a semblance of purpose.
24368	5	a	Wait-for-video more than straight-to-video.
24369	4	a	Charlize is overwhelming, completely dominating the screen.
24370	2	a	Take the movie on its own lighthearted terms and, chances are, you'll be taken in.
24371	3	a	A solid little B-movie arriving cloaked in the dodgy garb of a fanboy phenomenon, Snakes on a Plane really ought to garner some sort of award for truth in advertising: It's exactly what it says it is and very little else.
24372	4	a	Sausage Party takes racism and prejudice and throws them into its existential meat-grinder to explore identity, tolerance and religion in surprisingly intelligent fashion.
24373	1	a	A fine example of efficient, resourceful filmmaking.
24374	3	a	The most unsettling and inspired horror film since The Blair Witch Project.
24375	6	a	Too bad that when it comes time to finally produce a rabbit from his top hat, all Forster can manage is a mouse.
24376	3	a	Good thrill ride of a movie for teens and older.
24377	7	a	Who needs a creative storyline or meaningful connections when you can just string some shocking images together?
24378	5	a	Showalter, who wrote the screenplay with Laura Terruso ... puts Doris in so many cringe-worthy situations you wonder if the writers even like this hapless Staten Island cat lady of a certain age.
24379	0	a	A brilliant and brilliantly disturbing film.
24380	9	a	This movie is clearly intended to appeal to the prurient interests of dirty old men of all ages.
24381	4	a	Not for all tastes, but a wild ride if you get into it.
24382	2	a	Such a gentle picture that at times it threatens to drift off the screen.
24383	4	a	Just about every sci-fi/fantasy/superhero adventure you ever loved is in here somewhere.
24384	3	a	Saddle up that pony, pardner, and let's hit the multiplex. Hell or High Water is the modern western we've been waiting for. 
24385	6	a	A few sparkling performances and funny moments save this from being a complete waste of time, but it's not a promising way to start the Thanksgiving/Christmas movie season.
24386	6	a	There are laugh-out-loud moments and some well-observed satire, but when the movie tries to get serious, it collapses.
24387	3	a	There is a lot more grit and realism on display here than most faith-based movies.
24388	4	a	With all the beautiful settings and attractive people and gorgeously lit vineyards, there is an air of artificiality to Juliet, which is to real-life romance what Cheetos are to a nice piece of aged cheddar. But who doesn't like a Cheeto now and then?
24389	9	a	It should... be avoided like a contagious rash.
24390	2	a	A strange, light-hearted bit of quasi-sci-fi, with no small amount of heart.
24391	5	a	For a movie filled with magical occurences, Enchanted commits a cardinal sin: It forgets to cast a spell on the audience.
24392	3	a	A successful tribute to an era of optimism and competitiveness which was bitchin' -- and now seems very far in the past.
24393	4	a	Agreeable family fare that'll please the young 'uns but that adults will find only slightly diverting.
24394	9	a	It is universally terrible in virtually every department, save for the creepy charisma displayed by young Ferland.
24395	3	a	Bob Rafelson sends this movie out like a hissing flare from the island of the nearly-forgotten, and if justice had prevailed, moviegoers would have answered the call.
24396	5	a	I would just like to mention something to director Ronald F. Maxwell, parenthetically and completely as an aside: the South lost.
24397	6	a	The closing title cards convey just as much information -- and are nearly as entertaining -- as any of the preceding scenes.
24398	3	a	As action adventure goes, it's about the best there is.
24399	3	a	The movie has less biting originality than The Truman Show, but it proves that director Ross retains screenwriter Ross's flair for exploring real-life issues through divertingly far-fetched plots.
24400	0	a	Long the merry pranksters of the cinema, the Coens have given irony a vacation.
24401	3	a	So darned depressing in its observancy that it's no stretch to assume that writer/director Jenkins might have experienced something entirely similar first hand.
24402	5	a	Good Luck Chuck has laugh-out-loud moments, many more if you've never outgrown giggling at somebody saying a naughty word.
24403	2	a	A highly entertaining and surprisingly tense Thai caper revolving around a quartet of students who devise a test-cheating scheme for profit.
24404	0	a	Peachy keen. A luminous, sun-kissed Italian love story brimming with warmth, passion and feeling. This is utterly unmissable.
24405	4	a	Surprisingly touching adventure has sad moments amid comedy.
24406	1	a	Three Billboards is a wonderfully tragic comedy that gifts McDormand with an incredible character.
24407	6	a	Coincidences and improbabilities aside, the script sometimes borders on the absurd.
24408	4	a	The disaffected kids who shuffle through its universe have nothing to say, nothing to tell us. I'm not sure the movie has a whole lot more.
24409	4	a	Cadillac Records exists mainly as a holiday throw-away for those with a deep and abiding love for the kind of music it showcases.
24410	4	a	A watchable enough piece of summer entertainment.
24411	2	a	An interesting foreign war movie featuring a nice balance between drama and humor.
24412	4	a	A solid, if not exceptional, Scorsese takeoff, one that has just enough spunk and wit to make up for its often-apparent shortcomings.
24413	3	a	It's like a blanket; warm, reassuring, and something adults and kids alike can find huge comfort in.
24414	0	a	American Hustle may be full of people faking, but Russell is the real deal.
24415	0	a	Here's a film that oddly pleases two very different sides of my cinematic sensibility, the action-loving geek and the hopelessly romantic dreamer.
24416	6	a	So filled with mixed messages, misguided plot turns, and consecutive false denouements that, by the actual end, it finally comes off as nothing but an infuriating betrayal.
24417	5	a	Like its protagonists, it misses the target by inches.
24418	2	a	A brand of entertainment that's dissatisfying intellectually and formulaically.
24419	6	a	Too much potty humor -- and not enough inspired comedy -- sink this fourth installment in the SM franchise.
24420	2	a	Depp and Jolie lack sparks, but The Tourist is a light little lark of a mystery-love story.
24421	5	a	a stereopticon of a post-modern morality tale that can't overcome its own inertia.
24422	4	a	Aside from a few electric moments this is mostly a slow-moving, flat and unimpressive film.
24423	1	a	Here is an unabashed call to a new age of protests. Is it agit prop propaganda? You bet.
24424	1	a	The perfect Xer movie.
24425	2	a	The overall tone of this rocket-paced updating is exhilaratingly giddy, making it by far Disney's best animated film since Mulan.
24426	3	a	What in lesser hands could have become an immaculately observed period piece instead soars to creative heights with its literate and knowing script.
24427	1	a	As it opens, we're watching an audience watch a silent adventure film, and in a funny way we spend the rest of the movie watching ourselves get swept up in conventions we can see through.
24428	1	a	It is we who are made a little more complete for wrestling with, and watching, Penn's film.
24429	3	a	A human drama with some good laughs, winningly performed, and never predictable.
24430	4	a	Pokes fun at relationship stereotypes in a way that, while not exactly clever, is pretty amusing -- due in large part to the talented leads.
24431	4	a	It is intensely involving at the outset, but it faces an insoluble problem: The story, like the characters, has no place to go.
24432	4	a	Spielberg nearly capsizes the story with his customary emotional overkil...Still, the story of Cinque...and the rest of the Africans trying to get home is powerful.
24433	2	a	This trim adventure saga doesn't waste any time assigning heartwarming characteristics or backstories. It gets your heart pounding the old-fashioned way; it is exciting.
24434	4	a	Gives us television sitcom-like 'onesa' characters ... whose behavior seems prompted by whatever suits the scene rather than any kind of emotional truth.
24435	4	a	One wedding. No funerals. A pretty woman. Lots of borrowed somethings, but nothing new.
24436	2	a	There are several flaws in the story content and the pacing, but this movie still gets my vote.
24437	5	a	The movie feels more like it's stalling for time rather than filling itself with humanity and redemption.
24438	4	a	A movie that wants to keep its audience unsettled from beginning to end.
24439	2	a	You're liable to watch the whole thing with an expression of bafflement on your face, surprised, delighted, and alarmed by what you're seeing.
24440	3	a	Enjoyable, sharply-observed satire with a great script and strong comic performances from the entire cast.
24441	6	a	More business as usual, despite the feminist aspects of Kallen's story.
24442	9	a	Strictly for shallow-end-of-the-gene-pool types who find professional wrestling and monster truck shows too sophisticated for their simple-minded tastes.
24443	3	a	The very idea of a dishy man of science being bowled over by the mysteries of the soul is quite irresistible, and Pitt and Marling really sell the plot's implausible twists.
24444	3	a	"The Imitation Game"" leaves Turing's essential mysteries intact, but they will nonetheless find even the most public contours his story ripe with drama, excitement and deeply affecting resonance."
24445	4	a	The Savages is the sort of film that, while ringing with laudable authenticity and an admirable lack of maudlin sentimentality, prefers wallowing in misery to reaching for transformation.
24446	3	a	Outrageously obscene and unflinchingly funny.
24447	3	a	The Savages not only boasts Oscar-worthy performances from Philip Seymour Hoffman and Laura Linney as a self-absorbed brother and sister, its attention to detail makes it sweetly funny and genuine.
24448	5	a	Letters to Juliet...it's a chick flick thing.
24449	4	a	Hancock is horrendously disjointed and barely manages to tell a story, but I was delighted by its charisma and Will Smith's unexpected middle-finger timing.
24450	5	a	It is well made, with a great cast, but it just feels too conventional with very little insight into its title character.
24451	2	a	The makers don't go out of their way to make this original in any way, but the quality comes through.
24452	3	a	Dafoe never reverts to campy, movie-monster gestures but seems liberated, consumed by his character, inspired to give a performance that's intuitive and otherworldly.
24453	4	a	A more than solid piece of entertainment that proves that romance isn't dead after all.
24454	2	a	Christopher Robin is feel-good, merging Pooh, Piglet, Eeyore and the gang into the live action seamlessly, often with slapstick and crazy antics. It's also essentially a moving and uplifting story about a man having a mid-life crisis.
24455	2	a	Charlize Theron transforms into a husky street survivor... the kind of stunt that gets Oscar nominations. Theron turns it into a bristling performance that deserves them.
24456	6	a	Not as clever as it thinks it is.
24457	2	a	It's a sensual celebration of young love and lust.
24458	4	a	An important story, told with commitment.
24459	3	a	Thanks in no small part to its trio of hugely likeable teenage leads, the film breezes along, mixing comedy with drama to often seamless effect, while exploring the kind of issues that viewers can all find relatable.
24460	4	a	The movie has some pretty pictures and a few good jokes, but not nearly enough. And the story suffers from sitcom attention-deficit disorder, veering off in a new direction every half-hour or so.
24461	6	a	Self-righteous, reductive and bluntly straightforward.
24462	0	a	In an age when we rely on computerized directions and GPS devices to drive to the next town, it seems an almost mythic scenario.
24463	2	a	Four decades later, John Frankenheimer's Grand Prix remains the best film ever made about professional auto racing.
24464	8	a	Rarely has Williams ever seemed so rote, so glaringly sleepwalking through a role.
24465	6	a	Natalie Portman propels this revisionist, female-centric Western that one wishes were better... 
24466	1	a	The Ring is fine cinema, blessed with an unusual respect for the horror genre and its own inherent silliness.
24467	4	a	This brand refresh is woke and unwoke, deadly yet deeply unserious. You'll laugh ... and forget why before the end credits roll.
24468	4	a	Under Shane Black's direction...The Predator races along pretty swiftly, with a few good quips and a lot of good actors along the way. The bad news is that this doesn't entirely make up for the central plot gimmick and some confusing transitions.
24469	3	a	Although the film occasionally feels a bit forced or manipulative, it never loses its overall sense of credibility. Frances Mcdormand is simply great as Jane, and as usual never disappoints
24470	3	a	Paranoid Park is different, in that it also has a narrative -- a mystery, in fact -- that gives it a dramatic tension Van Sant's recent films have lacked.
24471	3	a	It can be perceived as a pleasant antidote to the Hollywood mainstream comedy.
24472	3	a	"One can't help but feel this version of ""Mary Queen of Scots"" could only have been made in a post-Hillary world, fueled by feminist anger searching for validation, for confirmation that men have ruined everything for centuries. "
24473	6	a	Rambling, episodic, and dramatically flawed, the picture nonetheless boasts some magical moments due to the wizardry in the technical departments.
24474	4	a	Brief nudity, language in drama based on real-life romance. 
24475	6	a	"Even as a contemporary blaxploitation picture, ""Waist Deep"" strikes an awkward balance between its pandering violence and its supposed social message. It's an ungainly hypocrite. "
24476	5	a	Bathos wrapped in a formulaic screenplay bolstered with cliches, not only about the boxing world but about tough women and the men who hate them.
24477	4	a	Only a director like Demme could make so many mob characters likable.
24478	4	a	"Despite its technological wizardry and fancy title, ""Billy Lynn's Long Halftime Walk"" is a contained drama about one introverted man struggling with repressed emotions. "
24479	2	a	Although lacking the lyric force of March of the Penguins and Winged Migration, the film combines a great story with world-class photography to tell a unique National Geographic tale.
24480	4	a	As long as you don't take a wrong turn and wander into this film thinking it's a run-of -the-mill horror flick, you'll have fun.
24481	3	a	Pitched with the insatiable verve of a TV game show and the vacant regret of a Grand Theft Auto videogame.
24482	6	a	That the boys are so earnest in their dedication to the Star Wars oeuvre signals their stunted adolescence.
24483	3	a	In any incarnation, Amadeus is beautiful to behold.
24484	4	a	Cautionary tale? Fashion show? Love story? Excuse for groovy soundtrack? George Hickenlooper's Factory Girl is a little of each, but not enough of any to make a satisfying film story.
24485	5	a	The film fails to explore more intriguing narrative possibilities regarding the psychological effects of its character's identity crisis.
24486	3	a	With legendary actor Anthony Hopkins inhabiting the legendary director with a passion and excellence we haven't seen from him since his Hannibal Lecter days, he makes director Sacha Gervasi's biopic a true holiday treat.
24487	4	a	The good news is that the film's stylistic excesses don't negate the many fascinating aspects of Nim's story.
24488	6	a	If you must, go for the scenery.
24489	9	a	You have to suffer through the de facto Miss America, Julia Roberts, pretending as though she's blending in with the furniture.
24490	4	a	A Perfect Getaway is one of those very clever whodunits that keeps you guessing for quite awhile. But on the way home, as you replay its tricks, you may feel more conned than charmed.
24491	4	a	It's dangerous stuff that shouldn't be dismissed lightly.
24492	1	a	This is some of Brolin's best work to date, though the film still belongs to Bardem and Jones, whose low-key mannerisms are well-suited to the Coens' sensibilities.
24493	3	a	The film never really goes for crescendo, rather it simmers a cauldron of heated but restrained emotions and sensations - gorgeously.
24494	3	a	[Robbins' and Pena's] scenes together are the highlight of the film, so natural, so bright. That's why we're willing to invest a lot of time in what turns out to be a terribly overwrought plot.
24495	1	a	There's just a gripping story and a tremendously talented cast. Craig takes Bond seriously, and he's a pleasure to watch.
24496	4	a	Excessive whodunit is definitely not for kids.
24497	7	a	The action is fun and sometimes imaginative, but the rest of the film is largely lacking in imagination.
24498	7	a	For all the visual pizzazz and gee-whiz athleticism, it's a bloated bore.
24499	3	a	A vast improvement over last year's film, bloated as it was with Quidditch matches and monster moments that didn't advance the plot one iota.
24500	3	a	Don't Say a Word is smart, stylish and, most important, satisfying.
24501	4	a	Matchstick Men may not measure up to that classic, but for those of us who have begun to dread the sight of Cage's name on a movie poster, it offers new hope.
24502	3	a	As a die-hard Red Sox fan, the highest praise I can give Pixar's latest is that it held my full attention after a madcap and largely sleepless Victory Parade weekend.
24503	6	a	At least half the film plays out at an acceptable level of amusement until its excessively repeated indecisions makes you hanker for the fast forward. This happens well before you reach the two hour mark.
24504	9	a	It's everything wrong with bad romantic comedies, all rolled into one easy-to-hate package.
24505	5	a	It's a mute-button movie, with passages of gorgeous cinematic craftsmanship. It's too bad the rest of the effort blocks the view.
24506	2	a	You won't be scared one bit, but that's not exactly the point here. The murder is the only message.
24507	6	a	A movie that never stops feeling like an advertisement for itself.
24508	5	a	It's kind of funny, although Smith works under the assumption you've seen all his movies.
24509	5	a	It's not that the film's message is wrong as whether we needed two hours of not very interesting stories about not particularly interesting people to get that lesson. 
24510	9	a	Between you and me, Dupree is a dud.
24511	0	a	Director Peckinpah effectively explores the levels of so-called 'manhood' and takes them to a ludicrous but ultimately exciting conclusion.
24512	5	a	The message of the movie is not to waste the time you're given. That includes watching movies as bad as this one.
24513	6	a	I's not hard to understand how Hughes turns out so many screenplays. He probably just leaves the old ones in his computer so they're easier to rewrite.
24514	4	a	As always, Park is delightfully absurd with his stop-motion tomfoolery, although the story by Mark Burton and James Higginson only occasionally reaches the heights of Aardman films past.
24515	3	a	A charming, intriguing biopic, given extra depth and sparkle by attractive performances from its superior cast.
24516	4	a	...the film improves substantially once Hannibal embarks on his mission of revenge - with the whole thing morphing into a brutal actioner along the lines of Death Wish and Man on Fire...
24517	1	a	Dujardin and Bejo light up the screen. It's easy to believe them as movie idols from a bygone era.
24518	6	a	Ends on a high note, but it doesn't negate the tedium of the number of false and mostly flat ones that precede it.
24519	1	a	Gladiator charges into heart pounding battle.
24520	3	a	A wonderfully realised account of intoxicating love and a movie with spirit and soul. Don't expect it to set the box office on fire though.
24521	5	a	An animated tale that's a million miles from the irreverent brilliance of The Lego Movie, but mercifully still more than a bare-minimum cash grab.
24522	4	a	While the comedy is sometimes broad, it avoids the need to humiliate its main characters or those around them. 
24523	6	a	More obvious and superficial with, except for Ms. McDormand, rather soapy and cartoonish elements.
24524	1	a	"Russell, following last year's sweet ""The Silver Linings Playbook"" with a very different tale of reinvention, has made a glittery disco ball of a movie, with Lawrence as its unexpectedly shining star."
24525	3	a	The charming and compassionate Love, Simon feels revolutionary.
24526	6	a	Moviegoers who enjoyed the PG anarchy the first time around should find amusement in the second Dozen. If the last picture left you with a migraine and a sense of claustrophobia, the sequel will be another bout of pain.
24527	8	a	Supremely listless and scare-free nonsense.
24528	8	a	What goes for dialogue was totally forgettable, or regrettable, or whatever...
24529	7	a	Apparently someone out there thought it would be a good idea to capitalize on American's love for penguins AND gross-out comedies.
24530	3	a	Though taken from an original script by Bob Nelson, the result could hardly be more characteristic of Payne if his name were watermarked into every frame.
24531	4	a	Winslet and Davis salvage what they can from the movie - a heroic effort, almost, making it a fun trifle, albeit one with some deadly serious overtones.
24532	9	a	The lifeless music and dance sequences in which the rapper performs with his crew have the feel of low-budget video clips that have been inserted almost by mistake.
24533	5	a	There isn't enough drama to take My Big Greek Wedding out of TV movie territory.
24534	5	a	Devolves into the derivative, leaning on badly-rendered CGI effects.
24535	9	a	What's remarkable is that the results are so blockbuster-bland. It might've helped if Black had stuck to the band of misfits angle, pitting the Predator against a group of war-ravaged vets who have to find a way past their damage if they're gonna survive.
24536	9	a	Even the heartfelt details are bizarre contrivances.
24537	6	a	All of this material, written by Seinfeld and writers associated with his television series, tries hard, but never really takes off.
24538	3	a	"In a way, the fact that the grey, austere Serbian city is such an odd choice for the middle-age romance ""Here and There"" is one of the film's charms. "
24539	0	a	A feelgood film that doesn't avoid life's harsh realities, Silver Linings Playbook is heartwarming winter treat.
24540	5	a	"Identity Thief"" is a cheap copy of much better comedies."
24541	4	a	Romero obliges those who are less concerned with meaning than with hard-core gore.
24542	6	a	... a shamelessly familiar concoction of dramatic cliches that recalls everything from Saturday Night Fever to Strictly Ballroom to Bring It On.
24543	2	a	The Imitation Game walks a fine line in making the familiar effective, also reflecting A Beautiful Mind at points. 
24544	3	a	I think the show is good fun, and I believe your family will too.
24545	4	a	Diane Lane and John Cusack have such terrific chemistry together in the genial romantic comedy Must Love Dogs that it's a wonder these two veteran performers have never been teamed before.
24546	3	a	Through the persons of Petey and Dewey, 'Talk to Me' examines two competing approaches by which a black man might achieve success in a white man's world.
24547	9	a	Plays like This Is Spinal Tap made from anti-matter. Both films are about aging rockers, but Year of the Horse removes the humor and energy.
24548	4	a	Paul Blart: Mall Cop is like the many variations on tuna surprise that show up at potlucks: generic but with a little something added to differentiate it.
24549	3	a	This is a thought-provoking film, and it features one of the best acting ensembles in awhile -- even by Sayles' standards.
24550	5	a	Remarkably, the highlight of Benson Lee's film, essentially a fiction reboot of his Planet B-Boy, isn't the scene where Chris Brown gets punched in the face.
24551	4	a	The concept works better in esoteric theory than it does in actual practice.
24552	5	a	While one respects the film for trying to juggle disparate tones, it never manages to find the proper balance.
24553	3	a	Amusing and thrilling albeit slightly overlong with dazzling visuals and clever nods to classic Westerns. 
24554	0	a	Every now and then in an age of darkness and cynicism, a life affirming film is just what we need.
24555	7	a	This may well be the dreariest and most monochromatic time you'll have at the movies all summer.
24556	4	a	Some killer tunes plus a genuinely believable turn from Glee star Paltrow make Country Strong a show worth catching.
24557	4	a	Because it never quite reaches its enormous potential, Secondhand Lions feels like a disappointment even though there's much to praise.
24558	5	a	Very little suspense.
24559	4	a	Based on a true story. Unlike Inglourious Basterds.
24560	4	a	If all you're looking for is a mild comedy with four or five solid laughs and a whole bunch of familiar faces, you could do worse.
24561	5	a	Michael Collins is more-or-less accurate, but being accurate and giving a complete picture of the Irish Troubles are two different things.
24562	7	a	Utterly unaware of its own absurdity.
24563	1	a	Pure edge-of-your-seat material. It is a gripping and engrossing tale ... told with the exhilarating energy of a runaway freight train.
24564	4	a	Director Chloe Zhao does an admirable job of introducing us to the rodeo world without being didactic about it. 
24565	3	a	It wants to be more than it is, but it's still good and contains a strong performance from Philip Seymour Hoffman.
24566	10	a	Martin's soul is for sale, dirt cheap.
24567	4	a	A thoroughly updated and nicely fleshed-out comedy that never quite makes you loose a molar laughing, but instead keeps solid little gags flowing throughout.
24568	3	a	Bleak and astringent indeed, yet suffused with almost radiant compassion for its poor, mixed-up characters.
24569	3	a	Backed by a smart story that avoids easy answers and pat endings, the rapper may be in line for some real acting recognition.
24570	9	a	Swapping politics for crass platitudes, Gods and Generals is a monumental folly.
24571	4	a	If you are looking for proof that Hollywood has completely run out of ideas, check out I, Robot.
24572	3	a	Light on plot but full of heartbreaking, subtle moments.
24573	1	a	A dizzying shout-out to those who believe there's only one answer for everything, whether it be faith, political principles or love.
24574	5	a	[Barry] Levinson has written and directed in many genres. But rarely has he made a film as indecisive and diffident as Man of the Year.
24575	3	a	Soderbergh rolls the dice with 'Logan Lucky' and comes up with a winner.
24576	4	a	There's plenty of bangs for your buck -- check out the dynamite-heavy ambush of a steam locomotive in the opening sequence.
24577	4	a	Malcolm Lee's sweet-natured dramatic comedy Roll Bounce captures the decade's texture with a well-earned nostalgia that never seems cheap.
24578	4	a	There is nothing about Into the Blue that is going to arouse anything above the waistline, but director Stockwell makes a fair show of it.
24579	5	a	A multiplex trip that's only slightly less annoying than a case of Montezuma's revenge.
24580	5	a	So unamusing its chief benefit lies in making us appreciate the movies being parodied.
24581	4	a	The awkward trappings of this Disney adventure mechanize and blunt the tale's humanity. It pops and squeaks and rumbles, but Treasure Planet lacks the strength to transport audiences. [Blu-ray]
24582	0	a	Writer/director Michel Hazanavicius uses a shrewd eye for visual composition to tell an emotionally effective story never waylaid by the clever throwback gimmickry of his method.
24583	3	a	maybe the most underrated movie ever
24584	8	a	Unspools into nearly two hours of baffling narrative choices, weak character development, and so many offensive cliches that it would be funny if they wasn't so, well, offensive.
24585	5	a	A slight but enjoyable-in-the-moment cataloging of one guy's battle with libido... [that] never manages -- or, sadly, seems to aspire -- to anything more than breezy diversion.
24586	3	a	Solid holocaust drama that confuses the importance of the subject with the importance of itself.
24587	6	a	...could have been worse. [Full review in Spanish]
24588	4	a	Charles Shyer's remake du jour is a charmingly chic, dramatically weak ode to the post-Metrosexual Revolution.
24589	6	a	Directed with a crisp eye and some fluid flourishes, and Foster makes the thing perfectly watchable, but one can't help but think Flightplan is all premise and no plot.
24590	3	a	A rich performance with the pathos and drama of a new age of technology set within the hardships of war.
24591	3	a	Not the perfect Bond film, but it still represents the series in its zenith and provides excellent entertainment even after more than three decades.
24592	1	a	...the true spirit of the film is in the story of desperate women who will do desperate things to make themselves happy, no matter who they hurt.
24593	4	a	It works well as a coming of age story and examination of how people communicate when they are unsure of the other's feelings.
24594	0	a	'Sweetie' is a rich black comedy told in dominant chords. When it resolves to minor, you can't help but be swept away.
24595	3	a	"Cranston ... continues his rewarding post-""Breaking Bad'' big-screen career with another juicy real-life role in the highly entertaining ""The Infiltrator."
24596	0	a	The story not only stands strong half a century later, but it continues to show up today's formulaic Hollywood films for the vacuous use of celluloid that they are.
24597	7	a	Director Greg Beeman fashions a toothless feature, though one with an undeniable pace and, well, Kathy Ireland in tiny outfits.
24598	3	a	The story, told with energy and humor, is aimed at family audiences, and should appeal to all but the smallest of children.
24599	5	a	Lawrence has become involved in a film that makes us acutely embarrassed for him.
24600	5	a	Just about everyone seems to get slashed, carved up or skewered, and vengeance rains down upon all. Except, of course, the one villain who truly deserved it. The filmmaker.
24601	4	a	For all the film's occasional peaks, we're left with the sense of a story so incredible even this cinematic visionary is struggling to contain it on celluloid.
24602	4	a	Bateman and McCarthy seem inspired enough to make this janky old jalopy of a story somewhat entertaining, playing to type with a lukewarm script.
24603	6	a	Manages to please its intended audience -- children -- without placing their parents in a coma-like state.
24604	3	a	Eminem delivers a performance of considerable passion and depth.
24605	3	a	Director Danny Cannon knows how to give a Hitchcockian air to an island-style Bates Motel.
24606	0	a	Filmmaker Marsh follows up the amazing Man on Wire with another thoroughly gripping narrative documentary, this time telling the life story of a chimpanzee that was raised as a human.
24607	4	a	Eye candy at its thickest, richest and exotically spiciest.
24608	5	a	David Cronenberg has made some fantastic films - Eastern Promises, The Fly - but this isn't one of them.
24609	3	a	Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri is an unassuming film that surprises you with its provocative subject matter and evocative performances that are hard to forget.
24610	4	a	Land of the Dead is just a giant excuse to see the walking dead pigging out on human flesh--in all its blood-dripping, bone-crunching, brain-slurping fashion. Yuck. 
24611	3	a	Westfeldt is so radiant, decent and likable that you, too, will fall in love with her.
24612	1	a	The film's prestige is a doozy, both dazzling and preposterous, but if you're watching closely, it's flawlessly set up.
24613	6	a	Never quite hits the sweet spot in balancing action and humor. The film clunkily moves back and forth between them, rather than getting them to work in unison.
24614	6	a	Say what you will about Andy Warhol's movies -- they may have been boring, but at least they weren't as dull as as Factory Girl.
24615	4	a	...suffers from an aimless, overlong sort of vibe that often threatens to negate its many positive attributes.
24616	9	a	"A world-beatingly annoying and pointless ""docu-romcom""."
24617	0	a	It's beautifully told, passionate and sensitive to the true story and the victims that lived it.
24618	6	a	...remarkably two-dimensional, showing evidence of having been edited down from something more complex.
24619	4	a	A mostly winning take on the tween-angst cartoon series
24620	2	a	Brilliantly paced and cut.
24621	3	a	Brings the horror stories of everyday life down to a recognizable level.
24622	6	a	It plays more like a big-budget episode of Remington Steele or Hart to Hart.
24623	5	a	You have to feel a certain sympathy for a project as cursed as this one, but there's no denying that Jane's gun barely grazes its target.
24624	7	a	"Like Freeway, the lovable stray dog at the center of this very teary comedy, ""Darling Companion""has lost its way."
24625	7	a	Even as someone who enjoys the company of a dog, it didn't take long for me to wish the whole bunch of them would shut up, give up and go home. Get a bird or something.
24626	4	a	A comedy that salutes friendship as a resilient and abiding bond that can carry people over troubled waters.
24627	7	a	Johnny Depp's performance as a trebly beset writer is the highlight of this underwhelming suspense thriller based on a Stephen King novella.
24628	0	a	"The songs, by ""Pocahontas"" Oscar-winners Alan Menken and Stephen Schwartz, are cleverly written, with each one evoking a Disney classic from another period."
24629	1	a	There are two iron wills in this movie. What's shocking is the lengths that each character goes to. A seriously campy tone almost undercuts the seriousness of the story, and it has its fair share of uncomfortable and shocking laughs.
24630	4	a	Its greatest liability, unfortunately, is Madonna.
24631	3	a	It's a gem with a distinct visual and atmospheric presence, with Moorhouse reclaiming her career in a major way.
24632	4	a	The film is by no means perfect and its goals are undermined by a sloppy climax and conclusion but it avoids preaching while providing fodder for thought.
24633	4	a	Life wouldn't have worked nearly as well as it did without Jolie, and I'm not sure too many other actresses could have carried this film.
24634	5	a	Forget dumb, stupid, loud, and endlessly derivative. I can live with those. But boring? I just didn't see that one coming.
24635	4	a	A shamelessly derivative but very energetic thriller that has Bryan Cranston in the kind of role that Al Pacino might have relished a generation ago.
24636	5	a	An honorable try, but also a trying picture...While the battle recreations are expertly done, everything else in the movie has a stilted, historical-pageant feel.
24637	3	a	Leave it to our favorite fuzzy freaks to breathe new life into Dickens' oft-told tale.
24638	3	a	"The movie is basically a sweet confection that, like this year's ""Ready Player One,"" relies heavily on nostalgia and pop-culture references to propel it."
24639	7	a	Mediocre, clunky and just so not special.
24640	4	a	It's not an easy film of righteousness, but a trembling drama, with more venom than anticipated, salvaged by a few outstanding performances. 
24641	2	a	An affecting drama that is honest and clear-eyed about Hirut's trauma, and the ongoing struggles she'll face even if she's freed, without ever treating her abuse in an exploitative manner.
24642	1	a	Even escapist entertainment this clinically zip-bam-wow should soothe your political burnout.
24643	1	a	A bit shallow but undeniably thrilling.
24644	9	a	If you want to find out how much scope the Old West contains for jokes about violent bowel movements, this is very much your movie.
24645	3	a	Better than average summer fare.
24646	0	a	The four girls in Our Little Sister make an impressive ensemble as their inclusive spirit and positive outlook restore a kind of equilibrium to a troubled hearth. It must be one of the films of the year.
24647	3	a	A tight, solid mystery/thriller that keeps you guessing until the end.
24648	0	a	Beautiful cinematography, exceptional performances and an admirable sense of restraint combine to make it one of the most gorgeous and satisfying period dramas in recent memory.
24649	0	a	A motion picture masterpiece on the short list of Reasons Why This Medium is Worthwhile.
24650	1	a	Are these the thoughts that ran through Pitt's head after he was hugged in Venice by that aggressive fan?
24651	4	a	Smith fans will have a lot of fun.
24652	5	a	Krasinski re-creates the interviews using Wallace's original, but this isn't exactly a letter-of-the-law adaptation -- he tightens the interviews and defangs some of the language.
24653	4	a	A heart-affecting film that depicts the transforming experience of loss and the chaotic, conflicting emotions of grief.
24654	5	a	The Tao of Steve has some genuinely comic scenes, some emotionally interesting scenes, and some inter-sexual insights worthy of expression.
24655	3	a	The overriding virtue...is the film's conviction in its own material.
24656	0	a	The one facet that separates Paranoid Park from the director's previous work is the way Van Sant uses all the talents in his arsenal to create something that few films have ever attempted to portray: the manic assemblage of teenage life.
24657	0	a	Guadagnino's film is one of swooning sentiment, but it never once cheapens or diminishes the rich emotion of its story for extraneous impact.
24658	6	a	The movie still just plods along, and there's nothing very new here.
24659	5	a	Forster's disjointed cuts and camera angles fail to spice things up as intended. Instead, he seems to be killing time until the film's trick ending.
24660	4	a	I found myself strangely emotional by the time the credits rolled.
24661	5	a	The good news is that Paltrow can sing; the bad news is the mawkish and one-paced drama she's playing in.
24662	4	a	An entertaining sex farce.
24663	3	a	Forgotten little gem from Robert Redford
24664	4	a	Everybody's so good, you find yourself wondering why the movie isn't funnier -- or riskier.
24665	5	a	When a straightforward description of the plot is funnier on an ironic level than any joke in the film, you're in for a bad time. 
24666	3	a	A snappy, humorous, and creative comedy about an ambitious pre-teen boy whose expends all his energy trying to win the approval of his middle-school peers.
24667	9	a	A shockingly crass grab for holiday pocket money that's both infantile and endlessly patronising.
24668	0	a	A classic. Tense, engrossing, scary and, subsequently, endlessly influential.
24669	4	a	Borte loses his nerve about halfway through and turns what should be a biting satire on American greed into a melodramatic lesson of conscience.
24670	2	a	So creepy it had me squirming in my seat.
24671	9	a	Beyond the ridiculous premise, there's nowhere for this story to go, and we don't get enough shark action to make up for it.
24672	6	a	So now even social apps are being turned into feature films? At this rate, should we expect Internet Meme: The Movie next?
24673	0	a	Chalamet, with his restless, impatient physicality and a face as sensual and sculpted as a fallen angel from a Caravaggio painting, is quite simply astonishing.
24674	4	a	As in real life, what is hilarious laddish behaviour to some will be annoyingly immature to other viewers. But the Ford Granada is perfect.
24675	8	a	If what you are looking for is an overwrought, hyper-violent reenactment of Jesus' final hours, that is what you will get here, and no more.
24676	4	a	Handsomely mounted but undistinguished...
24677	3	a	Some may find its ultimate reveal much ado about nothing, a long, violent road leading to a joke. Others will find deeper meaning about what we hold dear and how man's destructive impulses will find him obliterating the very thing he's sought.
24678	2	a	The extras begin with an intelligent, interesting and thorough audio commentary by director Alex Proyas and writer Akiva Goldsman.
24679	3	a	Hoffman's directorial debut a decent fall drama
24680	3	a	Classic Sandra Bullock romantic comedy.
24681	3	a	The finale is the one melancholy moment in an austere, violent story.
24682	4	a	"Albert Nobbs"" is never less than a tidy feat - but never more than a shuttered window."
24683	1	a	It's a beauty, all right. It's more a style show than a deep philosophical treatise, but with surfaces this sleek and faces this interesting, I'll take style over substance any day.
24684	9	a	This is a movie that operates at two speeds: Somebody is either giving a fake-sounding, melodramatic speech or fighting in a fake-looking, melodramatic battle.
24685	3	a	It's high time MLK got the big-screen platform he deserves. Thanks to Selma, justice has been done.
24686	5	a	You either love it or hate it. For those who loved it, I have only one word: overrated.c
24687	5	a	Unlike Rocky and other cornball boxing movies, this one fails to land the knockout blow and winds up dispensing love taps in a hardboiled business.
24688	2	a	Does a fine job of staying away from an overage of boredom and sentimentality while providing a good mix of laughter along the way.
24689	3	a	Its indulgent meta-filmic reverie and willingness to toy with film noir convention is a rare delight.
24690	3	a	The film treads familiar ground by pitting a bunch of Davids vs. egotistical Goliaths on the soccer pitch. But it does so in such a supremely quirky and earnestly heartwarming fashion that it's hard not to be charmed.
24691	4	a	Better on video than in the theatre. It's got that hindsight camp appeal.
24692	10	a	Hatefully stupid and unfunny.
24693	3	a	A unexpected pleasure to watch, disturbing for new parents, slightly silly but ever so enjoyable.
24694	0	a	"The real ""You betcha"" belt is exposed in all its raw beauty, with dying little towns, ancient residents and the children they've trapped there with them."
24695	5	a	A fairer title might have been Ronin in the Gloamin'.
24696	3	a	An exquisitely rendered study of colonialism, memory and cultural erasure.
24697	4	a	Enjoyable comedy with Owen Wilson on fine comic form, this is a lot better than its trailer suggests.
24698	4	a	It's not a good movie, and I'd even go as far as saying that it's easily the worst of the Cloverfield flicks so far. Don't get caught up in the marketing hype, there are better things to watch.
24699	3	a	It's as gooey as a jar of honey, and just as sweet.
24700	4	a	Marlon's no-limits performance, relying only on his voice and facial expressions, proves to be the film's strongest asset.
24701	5	a	Director George Hickenlooper incessantly switches between black-and-white, grained-out, color-saturated, handheld and fuzzy shots. He's not so much making a movie as an audition tape for the cameraman's guild.
24702	6	a	Maybe if the plot was more engaging I wouldn't have been so distracted, but Barnyard was pretty disappointing.
24703	4	a	While Gladiator is nothing if not stimulating and richly visual, director Ridley Scott's sense of grandeur is inconsistent, and he often over-reaches in his attempts to modernize the storytelling for MTV audiences.
24704	0	a	Outstanding film making and the director's best film in years.
24705	3	a	Chadwick Boseman steals the show in this electric look at the unforgettable life of James Brown.
24706	2	a	If you don't mind the technical confusion it's a gripping story, and a great credit to DuVernay and co-writer Paul Webb who were unable to use King's original speeches for copyright reasons. 
24707	3	a	I know the ending is preordained from the setup. I know the characters are broad and comforting stereotypes. In this case, I simply don't care. Sometimes we have personal reasons for responding to a film.
24708	3	a	Sienna Miller, revealing a depth and presence she's never hinted at before, inhabits Sedgwick with raw exuberance.
24709	4	a	Unfolding with a hyperactive but magnetic sense of momentum, Get on Up does, indeed, get on up, scene after scene.
24710	3	a	Jennifer Lawrence is entirely extraordinary, improving on the performance that won her an Oscar for Russell's last film. Long may this collaboration continue.
24711	6	a	Like its supersonic, jets-in-his-feet hero, the movie itself feels totally robotic.
24712	9	a	To say that the script is bottom-of-the-barrel would be too kind; this one was already decomposing under a mountain of mulch before Debra Messing unwisely fished it out.
24713	3	a	Lee Evans steals every scene he's in.
24714	1	a	Nurse Betty is something quite original: a comic meditation on our involvement with popular culture, one that honors the power of even the most banal and trivial art.
24715	2	a	It's an impressive display of range from one of film's true maverick talents.
24716	2	a	While you must love dogs, it's ok if you just really like the movie. What I love is the match John Cusack and Diane Lane make on camera.
24717	2	a	First love, a friend's powerless deception and a perfectly timeless score, credited to Ryan Miller, keep things moving along in a feel-good kind of way.
24718	6	a	Romanticization takes precedence over analysis in Into the Wild, Sean Penn's exasperating adaptation of John Krakauer's nonfiction bestseller.
24719	1	a	I have no compulsion whatsoever in declaring Skyfall, in terms of cinematography, the best looking Bond film ever ... Action movies simply don't look like this - but ... this is no ordinary action movie.
24720	4	a	This is one of those untaxing time-killers where you spend a lot of time pondering which of its actress's changing hairstyles you like best.
24721	4	a	When it works, which is more than half of the time of the time, it's a cheerful little romp that refuses to take itself seriously
24722	9	a	Paper Towns is way outside the US tradition of high-school movies that are funny and sharp.
24723	4	a	Mostly fun to watch, buoyed by some strong dialogue and performances by the supporting cast.
24724	9	a	There's nothing quite like the words 'Happy Madison Productions' appearing on the screen to diminish my expectations concerning the movie about to unfold.
24725	4	a	Aliens In The Attic might fall between a key audiences but will certainly provide a rip-roaring time for both tweens and younger kids, never mind the parents who are seemingly dragged along.
24726	1	a	Chappaquiddick reminds us that without the Kennedy name and influence, the man who drove a car off a bridge, swam to shore and left a young woman to die, and then went into hiding and defense mode, should have gone to jail for a long time.
24727	3	a	Difret is concerned with Ethiopian feminism in both method and narrative.
24728	2	a	"Divided We Fall"" is a vital reminder of the kinds of dramatic choices made by millions of peopled victimized by Nazis and traitors in a war that was fought at all costs."
24729	3	a	Aniston shows promising signs of a post-sitcom career with her convincing and understated dramatic work.
24730	5	a	[Guillermo del Toro's] grandiose ambitions to update the haunted house story result in a lurid mess, entertaining for all the wrong reasons.
24731	1	a	Diamond-hard and dazzlingly brilliant, David Cronenberg's film plays like a deeply perverse, darkly comic successor to Videodrome.
24732	9	a	Coppola has made a film of intoxicating atmosphere and little else.
24733	3	a	more than good enough to stand on its own, and its only real weakness is that Romero moves through the narrative too fast
24734	6	a	There are laughs, to be sure, and some gleeful supporting performances, but after a promising start the movie sinks in a bog of sentiment.
24735	3	a	Iguanas aside, Cage's performance is the film's centerpiece. He starts at over the top and climbs ever higher...
24736	5	a	If Will Smith can pull off this hodgepodge of a movie, an ill-conceived poorly executed effort that tries to be all things to all people, then he really is Hollywood's most bankable star.
24737	3	a	Absorbing biopic.
24738	6	a	... a neat idea with some interesting visuals that flounders in execution.
24739	3	a	Though flawed, Dancer in the Dark is a worthy addition to the filmography of Mr. von Trier.
24740	5	a	Liman, of Swingers and Go, makes his big-budget action film debut something of a clunker as he delivers a long, low-heat chase, interrupted by a middling car chase.
24741	1	a	The series has progressed from reciting J.K. Rowling's source novels to paraphrasing them.
24742	3	a	An engrossing, if harrowing, trip through the looking glass.
24743	2	a	Two solid actors save a movie from its own pretense.
24744	2	a	The most terrifying movie of the new year.
24745	4	a	A film many people may be tempted to laugh off as button pushing feel-good fluff. Before doing so, they might want to ask themselves just what it is they find so funny about a little peace, love and understanding.
24746	6	a	Unpolished, undernourished and inconsequential, Hotel for Dogs is mediocre, at best. You watch it, you wait for it to be over, and you go about your day without giving it another thought.
24747	3	a	A gleeful and unapologetic descent into delicious decadence, Killer Joe is proud of what it is and never tries to be something it isn't.
24748	9	a	Here are two things that stopped being cute a long, long time ago: Baby Got Back and Alvin and the Chipmunks. They're both here in the fourth live-action movie from a series that continues to find its plot and gags by foraging in the trash.
24749	2	a	a sweeping story that has many ups and downs, with some pretty noticeable changes in tone and pace
24750	0	a	I was quite literally on the edge of my seat for all of its lightning fast ninety minutes. It's not just merely good -- it's nothing less than one of the best pictures of the year
24751	4	a	Craig brings a spiky wit and a warm-hearted, nerd-friendly finale to a comedy that wants for nothing but a little substance.
24752	6	a	Soft, sugary and sitcomish confection.
24753	2	a	The film is often filled with a sense of pure wonderment and excitement not often seen in today's cinema du sarcasm
24754	1	a	Beyond Anthony Hopkins' droll impersonation of Hitch, the film rises from amusing bauble to full-throated and satisfying depiction of a great man and the unheralded woman who helped make him so.
24755	6	a	The Fantastic Four get treated reverently, but not seriously, in this modified retelling of the story, but then it's hard to take any one seriously who goes to work for Dr. Victor Von Doom and Doom Industries.
24756	2	a	The film's four lead actors all slip seamlessly back into their onscreen alter egos as if they've been keeping tabs on them all these years.
24757	4	a	Initially intriguing and energetic, this film ends up demonstrating that a good script needs to be more than a clever concept and fine direction must be more than moving things fast.
24758	4	a	What it lacks in originality it makes up for in intelligence and B-grade stylishness.
24759	9	a	The retro cattiness of Parker's mother-in-law and of the mothers at her kid's school feels like it time-traveled from three decades ago.
24760	2	a	Comes alive in the ballets, which convey not only the creative energy of their own story-telling but the ultimate expression of the performers' passion for their art. 
24761	3	a	The film's wilful ambiguity will doubtless prove frustrating for many, but this is a truly nightmarish tale, as real people in a terrible situation make snap decisions that lead to devastating consequences. It's gripping, terrifying, and heartbreaking.
24762	5	a	It's push-the-limits teen comedy, the type written by people who can't come up with legitimate funny, and it's used so extensively that good bits are hopelessly overshadowed.
24763	4	a	Above all, it's a very gothic piece of work. Long, sullen shots of decrepit manors and foggy moors make this one of the most atypical -- and interesting -- animated films to hit Austin in a long while.
24764	1	a	No quote available.
24765	2	a	What truly sets Deliver Us from Evil apart from other documentaries is interviews with the monster himself.
24766	3	a	Brittle and insecure, yet also steely and magnetic, Bening's performance is full of nuance.
24767	3	a	Excellent comedy. You can just feel how good intentions turn disastrous.
24768	1	a	Engages us in constant fits of laughter, until we find ourselves surprised at how much we care about the story, and end up walking out not only satisfied but also somewhat touched.
24769	3	a	Geisha offers a colorful glimpse that is as alien to most Western audiences as the dark side of the moon.
24770	3	a	Writers Hood and Williams conjure up a plot worthy of Ms. Austen herself, using Austen's real-life brothers and sisters for scandalous and tragic romantic subplots.
24771	3	a	... as the story continued, and the layers of character developed, and the action heated up, the gang from the spaceship Serenity found a place in my sci-fi loving heart ... 
24772	6	a	Not witty enough to be a spoof and not frightening enough as a horror tale, this one would not scare dedicated ophidiophonbes.
24773	4	a	While the hidden agenda that eventually surfaces does strain credibility, Foster's ability to reign in the improbable ... allows this flight to deliver the requisite thrills.
24774	6	a	"Regardless of the frames, dimensions, or goggles used to conjure it, ""The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey"" is an incredible ride and a triumphant return to Middle Earth."
24775	6	a	Incoherent look at life for the upper-crusts during the turbulent last days of the corrupt Batista regime.
24776	3	a	What could have been an epic Disney misfire is saved by the charming Adams.
24777	2	a	The writing team of Dan Fogelman and co-director Williams have concocted one of the most witty and often hilarious Disney outings in years.
24778	3	a	The film also feels overlong at times, but while it's not as great as it could have been, it's still definitely worth seeing.
24779	6	a	Unfortunately, the main couple in the film competes in vain against the scenery.
24780	2	a	The film is unique in that it's not a story about an artist's ascent toward triumph, but about his descent from triumph toward irrelevance and oblivion. D.B.
24781	5	a	Avoid this mall cop and just go shopping instead.
24782	3	a	Bleed for This is the kind of film we all need right now.
24783	1	a	Clint Eastwood, a master director, orchestrates all of these notes and has us loving Mandela, proud of Francois and cheering for the plucky Springboks. A great entertainment.
24784	6	a	This is the cinematic equivalent of comfort food. It goes down easy and may not be the most nutritious meal, but if you're in the mood for it, nothing else will do. 
24785	4	a	It's still a tear-jerker, but it doesn't make you feel like a jerk for tearing up.
24786	4	a	Russell ... has plenty of vision, intelligence and gall but he doesn't quite have the steady hand and comic flair that a masterpiece- wannabe such as this demands.
24787	6	a	A documentary that wakes us up to the pitfalls of politically controlled television and then puts us to sleep watching the people producing it.
24788	6	a	Has its few garlicky moments of delight.
24789	5	a	While it's generally well made and pulls off a couple of decent jumps, it's also riddled with plot holes, painfully derivative and lacking the requisite chills.
24790	5	a	A rare misfire within Gavin O'Connor's otherwise solid body of work...
24791	3	a	DiCaprio is maturing into a fine actor who looks like a slender young Bill Clinton.
24792	0	a	Put simply, Trainspotting is one of those films that gets the mixture just right. The dialogue, the music, the performances, the direction, the production values, the humor, the shock-value.
24793	3	a	Coppola's observational and satirical skills are impressive.
24794	4	a	Delightful stuff.
24795	4	a	Turns spectacle into a contemplation piece.
24796	6	a	White hasn't developed characters so much as caricatures, one-dimensional buffoons that get him a few laughs but nothing else.
24797	2	a	"Picture this as a ""Goodfellas"" with Bryan Cranston. "
24798	1	a	"Kasi Lemmons' radio drama of flamboyance, fury and finesse cranks the funk on a sister station to ""Talk Radio"" and ""Good Morning Vietnam,"" powered by two performances of impeccable clarity and cut from Don Cheadle and Chiwetel Ejiofor."
24799	5	a	Rocky takes on Mr. T; fans catch some zzzzs
24800	3	a	While the film starts off slow, Lee's story develops into an amazing trip; no pun intended.
24801	6	a	Somewhat silly but reasonably entertaining.
24802	6	a	Now seems peculiarly dated....The contrivances here are obvious and heavy-handed.
24803	4	a	"Electric performances, the plot, and the cheerful guitar score by Christophe Beck, help make The Alarmist a fun and... well... ""quirky"" experience."
24804	5	a	Arctic Tale tries to be everything to everyone but fails at all.
24805	0	a	It's a movie with heart and with balls, and it knows when to use each of them.
24806	2	a	Whenever the music is playing, it's tough to fight the urge to rock out right in your theater seat.
24807	2	a	...Step Up All In plays to its audience with familiar faces and new fantastic dance talent.
24808	5	a	A video game alone is not sufficient source material for a whole movie.
24809	4	a	an interesting yarn, but while watching it I was unable to shake that it was so ... freaking ... slow.
24810	6	a	By turns raw, naturalistic and indebted to John Cassavetes.
24811	2	a	Foreign Correspondent works best for what it was designed for: Propaganda.
24812	3	a	Just a good old fashioned time at the cinema, but check your brain at the door.
24813	2	a	Even without web shooters or a light saber, Damon comes out as one of the good guys of summer.
24814	4	a	Kimball's work is always appealing to the eye yet never too noticeable so as to draw attention away from the movie's plot.
24815	5	a	Dana Fox's script is all setup, skimping on the quirky character touches and comedic flourishes that could make a predictable outcome gratifying.
24816	5	a	It makes nerds and studs alike so noble that it turns the chase into a neutered game.
24817	2	a	A loud and gaudy production of a hit play turned into a hit movie.
24818	4	a	You get the sense that Lima and writer Bill Kelly barely scratched the surface of possibilities of their clever but largely unexplored gimmick.
24819	4	a	This could have been a triumph of structure over story if only the importance of the structure had been better camouflaged.
24820	5	a	In his attempt to produce a definitive, enhanced-strength version of the text, Jackson has stripped away much of the fun, a great deal of the energy and most of the humour.
24821	4	a	A rousing oater that is both watchable and forgettable.
24822	3	a	An uncompromising look at life, with all its questionable triumphs and irreversible consequences, performed by a cast that is virtually untrained and entirely genuine, with a fully engaging performance by Martin Compston.
24823	5	a	"So proud of the term ""pizza toots"" they put it in the trailer. The prosecution rests."
24824	2	a	It's an exciting yarn...and does not disappoint the action junkie. It's just not great.
24825	3	a	The more tightly Taking Woodstock focuses on history, the more satisfying the experience.
24826	4	a	Ultimately what makes this picture fly is Foster, who's playing another character who turns jeopardy into vengeance as a rite of motherhood.
24827	3	a	Personally, it's my favorite out of the four Vacation films. Many people don't agree with me, however.
24828	5	a	It is a shame that a movie about the people who are most passionate about edgy, imaginative stories is itself slipshod and formulaic.
24829	4	a	Sporadically inspired.
24830	3	a	The To Do List is cheerfully unconcerned with realism; the cast is so obviously over high school age it almost becomes part of the joke.
24831	10	a	Looks like it was directed by a blind and deaf person over a weekend on a leftover laboratory set from a TV show and edited with a roulette wheel.
24832	6	a	Mao's Last Dancer is an epic tale of love and betrayal, triumph and heartbreak, that captures the real-life drama and emotion of one man's search for freedom. Well, it almost is.
24833	1	a	A searing and fascinating example of a 'ripped from the headlines' story expanded to uncover some uncomfortable truths about how a nation handles its social problems.
24834	0	a	Memoirs of a Geisha is grand entertainment, telling its epic story in bold yet graceful terms without ever descending to melodrama or soap opera.
24835	3	a	Film is infused with John Dahl's terrific sense of the macabre.
24836	3	a	What lingers strongly in the memory and heart is, as it should be, the sweet, celebratory sensation of song.
24837	0	a	No Country for Old Men may just be the year's best picture.
24838	4	a	Here we have a brainy, sometimes impenetrable director, working from a book by brainy, sometimes impenetrable author. What do they come up with? Something that's brainy, sometimes impenetrable.
24839	0	a	A genuinely beautiful and human story out of the Hollywood mills. Subtly amazing work from all concerned.
24840	4	a	Though visual prodigies abound, the nightmare never gets real enough.
24841	0	a	The performances in Carol are simply spectacular. [Full review in Spanish]
24842	3	a	As a thriller, this movie is effective and gripping, if occasionally contrived as a result of overplotting.
24843	3	a	"Ixcanul"" provides a window into a culture that we rarely see. But it's not just an anthropological study - it has a powerful story to tell, too."
24844	0	a	Not only is Blade Runner a relevant masterpiece that asks poignant questions about what it means to be human, but it also looks like it could have been made today.
24845	3	a	Splashes of overstatement aside, the ambition intoxicates.
24846	3	a	Spielberg creates an alien invasion movie that can be labelled the antithesis to the likes of Independence Day or the ilk. The reason? The personal perspective.
24847	3	a	Nurse Betty isn't LaBute's masterpiece, but it's definitely a solid, funny, and unique film, the likes of which you won't see again this year.
24848	1	a	"We Have a Pope"" is a nuanced, moving and profoundly humane exploration of doubt, faith, weakness and resolve."
24849	2	a	The film seems to drag on a little too long and is slow moving in spots, but it will certainly jerk more than a few tears from audiences around the country.
24850	3	a	when it is served up with such pulpy panache, old-fashioned expertise and a hero so easy to root for
24851	9	a	A moth-eaten stranded-in- the-desert yarn so manipulative that the involuntary jolts of adrenaline it produces make you feel like a fool.
24852	5	a	Yeah, cheaper is right.
24853	1	a	It Comes at Night shows that no matter how much you can prepare for the worst, no one is ever actually ready for it.
24854	4	a	"The second Winslet sets her sewing machine on the ground and snarls, ""I'm back, you bastards,"" we're delighted to hear we're in for something fun. "
24855	5	a	Instead of elevating the Angry Birds concept to surreal heights of insane genius, the filmmakers settle for a tale bogged down by familiar themes plucked from much better films.
24856	4	a	Sam Jackson delivers the electric blues in a not-so-blue movie that promises more Deep South sin than it actually delivers.
24857	7	a	Weighted by good intentions, Ryan turns a potentially riveting story of two lost souls shaken by trauma into a sappy teen drama.
24858	4	a	It's cheesy, but what else could be expected from a film with talking animated chipmunks?
24859	3	a	Hoffman intrigues by keeping his cards clasped firmly to his chest. It is a restrained, controlled performance from one of the most talented screen actors of his generation. He's so good it's heartbreaking.
24860	2	a	The film teases us with a paradox: arguably Nim's keepers were wrong to try to endow their protege with human attributes, but can we empathise with his suffering without making the same mistake?
24861	4	a	Gore Verbinski creates beautifully-composed pictures of unpleasantness throughout -- moments that sneak around the memory for days after viewing.
24862	3	a	Through it all, Dujardin has great dignity, is hugely likeable, and pulls off touches of comic poignancy not far from Chaplin's.
24863	3	a	A loopy, off-kilter, often-dark comedy that's alternately sweet and nasty.
24864	2	a	A lot more nimble than the first movie.
24865	3	a	"Dragon Tattoo"" knows precisely how to achieve its look, rhythm, sound and spirit. It's extremely well made by a genuine and reliable talent. But I thought he was done with this sort of thing."
24866	5	a	The completely formulaic script by Trey Callaway is directed by the numbers by Danny Cannon.
24867	9	a	Until the mainstream produces some films undeserving of idiot violation, the idiot violation represented by Meet the Spartans -- a Xerox of absolute zero -- will be par for the course.
24868	4	a	It's never clear why Martin is the star of Philomena, except that Coogan's sharp tongue is more entertaining than Dench's relentless homily spewing.
24869	3	a	Movingly told and packed with powerful subject matter.
24870	4	a	Decent urban drama.
24871	4	a	Despite this rather limited emotional arc, Ben Younger's film sings at times: the boxing scenes are excellent, and Hinds and a virtually unrecognisable Eckhart do much to beef things up dramatically.
24872	4	a	Michel Gondry directs and while there's little of his usual surreal flair there are moments when he puts his mark on the explosive mayhem, giving it the style of a live-action Looney Toons cartoon.
24873	5	a	Garcia's production is as starchy as Albert's collars and as humorless as his masquerade... Close's performance is technically perfect and emotionally pinched, which is exactly what her role calls for, but it doesn't make a compelling movie.
24874	3	a	Just as in real life, no matter what else is going on in these musicians' lives, the music temporarily makes everything much better.
24875	5	a	A disappointing costume drama.
24876	5	a	Occasionally fun in its over-the-top mindlessness; the fun just never lasts more than a couple minutes at a time.
24877	6	a	A bizarre murder case comes to Fort MacCallum, Georgia, in this exciting, over-the-top detective thriller.
24878	3	a	Director Jeffrey Levy-Hinte pads out the concert footage with not always stimulating backstage stuff, but the music makes it all worthwhile.
24879	2	a	Instantly forgettable, but good fun while it lasts.
24880	2	a	The Dogs of War is a guilty pleasure that is now old enough it sometimes actually pops up on Turner Classic Movies.
24881	3	a	Nonetheless, by stepping backward in filmmaking technology and content, he creates a story that might endure like a cave painting. 
24882	2	a	Makes a cliched story seem fresh, but one too many bad choices yank it away from the truly inspiring.
24883	4	a	Tolkien tale isn't as great as LOTR, but better for tweens.
24884	6	a	Given the similarities between the two films -- the muddled fight scenes, the occasional one-liners, the over-the-top violence, used to camouflage the narrative weaknesses -- this easily could have been titled Rambo V.
24885	5	a	All of these people can make better movies than this, and most of them have.
24886	4	a	Slugs eating people. No more, no less.
24887	6	a	If ever a flimsy film franchise was going to fold in on itself by instalment three, you would bet the house it would be Pitch Perfect.
24888	5	a	Even though all the Steve Harvey stuff has been completely jettisoned, it's not as funny as the first 
24889	8	a	So lifeless, pointless and dank that it manages the amazing feat of making the undead seem boring.
24890	2	a	"Exquisite and touching, ""Carol"" examines the high price of true love..."
24891	4	a	Charming but sentimental...
24892	4	a	Weir and editor Lee Smith seem preoccupied with hustling events along, and nervous about boring us for even a second. The result is a brisk trot through a story that is, at heart, a tough slog.
24893	5	a	Herzog has unique flair, but it's out of synch with the genre. As for Cage, he is a flailing madman and the only polite thing to do is look away.
24894	2	a	A King King knock off, and one that's highlighted by some awesome creature special effects.
24895	6	a	Serenity is so like TV that it ought to come with a clicker so we can switch over to the next movie at the multiplex.
24896	2	a	Plays like a spunkier Good Morning Vietnam with a Motown twist.
24897	0	a	Entering its third decade, but has lost none of its power to awe.
24898	6	a	After some student and parental resistance, a medley of obvious platitudes and great bathos washes over the place, and everybody is righteously lifted up where they belong.
24899	6	a	In his latest science-fiction epic, director Steven Spielberg shows he's better at blowing up the world than anyone else alive. Unfortunately, he also shows he has no idea how to put the world back together.
24900	9	a	It saddles Bateman with a thankless uptight straight-man role while heaping serial slapstick ignominies on his co-star, who gamely bounds through everything the script throws at her.
24901	5	a	In addition to some trite set pieces, writer-director Dan Mazer serves up nothing more than conspicuous cynicism masquerading as comedy.
24902	9	a	Maybe the best way to look at Jackass: The Movie is as a piece of conceptual art. How far and low will these guys go? What's the pinnacle of pointlessness?
24903	10	a	When a film critic starts throwing popcorn at the movie screen, something has to be wrong.
24904	0	a	the kind of romantic comedy that even the most unromantic lout in your life will enjoy.
24905	6	a	...we've seen more funny flexibility from a tedious filibuster in the US Senate. It's basically a political ping pong match being played clumsily without the paddles.
24906	3	a	Filled with fascinating characters, wonderfully portrayed by a gifted cast of actors.
24907	0	a	I have been waiting most of my adult life for Paul Schrader to direct a great film.
24908	4	a	Full though shallow, a swell trip to Barcelona.
24909	3	a	Fairly gimmicky but entertaining fluffball.
24910	5	a	At best, this is a dawdling, toothless riff on a vastly superior film. At worst, it's character assassination.
24911	0	a	The story is simple but perfectly executed, the cast all provide stellar work, and the film's message about family and dreams is wonderfully poignant.
24912	2	a	The kind of film that makes me glad that I'm living in a blue state. In other words, it's effective.
24913	2	a	still contains enough pleasures even with the 'secret' so well known
24914	4	a	A better than average space vampire flick.
24915	4	a	interesting, colorful backstage Beatles chronicle
24916	9	a	This film is painfully predictable.
24917	3	a	Engaging film with a terrific message.
24918	4	a	Like a Wes Anderson attempt to make a Paul Thomas Anderson movie of a Thomas Pynchon novel -- it works...for a while. 
24919	6	a	Rinsch's vision of Japan is brimming with imagination, and I found myself wishing I could spend more time there. I just don't want any of these people with me.
24920	7	a	This dim-bulb, family-oriented slapstick film benefits greatly from James' knack for physical comedy, but it's ultimately too bland and uninspired.
24921	5	a	Imagine that you are listening in on the marriage-counseling sessions of the dullest couple you know. Multiply that by four, and you've got a pretty good approximation of the experience of watching Couples Retreat.
24922	5	a	The film... very quickly passes its sell by date. 
24923	6	a	Crisp, breathtaking battle sequences that nearly put live-action to shame.
24924	8	a	This is industrially processed entertainment at it cheapest, nastiest and greasiest.
24925	6	a	It's a decent glimpse into a time period, and an outcast, that is no longer accessible, but it doesn't necessarily shed more light on its subject than the popular predecessor.
24926	5	a	I can't reccomend it wholeheartedly
24927	3	a	Vertical Limit is about as silly as movies come, but the only thing that really counts is whether or not the action sequences are exciting. And they are, in a big way.
24928	1	a	Audience members who found previous Coen brothers' works too precious can rejoice in this, their best film--close to an American masterwork.
24929	4	a	Frequent flurries of creative belly laughs and genuinely enthusiastic performances...keep the movie slaloming through its hackneyed elements with enjoyable ease.
24930	9	a	Martin Lawrence at his most shrill in one of the laziest movies ever made.
24931	6	a	You'd probably be just as entertained chasing your own tail.
24932	3	a	The acting is first-rate -- especially by Paymer, who's affecting in a part with very little dialogue.
24933	9	a	There are many things wrong with this film, starting with title.
24934	4	a	It all seems like an overblown TV episode.
24935	4	a	A passionately crafted picture, but it's hard to connect with some significant characters because their motivations go largely unexplored.
24936	0	a	This is the best movie I've seen this year.
24937	3	a	As odd as it is mesmerizing.
24938	3	a	...great entertainment: humorous, adventurous, inventive, and enthralling.
24939	4	a	[Director] Baratz doesn't ask any of the obvious questions, preferring to observe uncritically, and if you can do the same, you may find Unmistaken Child worth seeing. I could not, and grew restless.
24940	4	a	It's funny and all, sometimes extremely funny, but it often seems as rough and worn as the plastic nose on Ted's face.
24941	1	a	Perhaps the most challenging film released this year. 
24942	5	a	I found the woman to be selfish, narcissistic and by the time everything was over I didn't actually believe she learned anything new about herself at all.
24943	3	a	Almost perfect.
24944	3	a	Pitching him as an existentialist fugitive who drifts round department stores and into bars trying to reconnect with the world again, Piccoli's performance takes the film to a very sombre place.
24945	4	a	The House With a Clock in its Walls ... is a bit rickety and never stops trying too hard. But it also represents a return to form for family-friendly horror.
24946	6	a	I enjoyed this inside look at how Psycho became Hitchcock's biggest hit, but I can't imagine how anyone who hasn't studied Hitchcock would find much of interest in it.
24947	3	a	Creating this kind of otherworldly mood takes exceptional talent, and this is a film worth experiencing.
24948	4	a	It may be Loach's saddest film.
24949	5	a	This is all too bland, too serious. The characters needed a significant injection of charisma.
24950	0	a	Spielberg flips the E.T. script with this sci-fi flick which reverts to the pulp fiction notion of aliens as the enemies of earthlings.
24951	2	a	Stanton is gleefully committed to letting this universe run wild on a big screen. The film's best qualities are its gigantic, densely packed, slightly loopy world-building and its unironic senses of humor and fun.
24952	6	a	Sure to please slackjaws who are not tired to death of this kind of material recycled again and again and again.
24953	6	a	The plot is simple-minded and disappointing, and the chase and action scenes are pretty much routine for movies in the sci-fi CGI genre.
24954	4	a	It is a sweet and funny sitcom, but without an iota of originality.
24955	0	a	Unpredictable and refreshingly inventive, this flick certainly stands on its own as perhaps South Korea's kookiest contribution to the battle-of-the-sexes genre.
24956	4	a	Average Lee, but still enjoyable overall.
24957	6	a	I realize Hanks, who also directed, wanted to make an upbeat, positive character study about rebounding in the face of unemployment and hardship. But did a story so hopeful also have to be so harmless? When did the everyman become the generic man? 
24958	6	a	Cassavetes never paints a compelling enough picture to warrant either my interest or my sympathies on a universal level.
24959	6	a	A howlingly badly written post-apocalyptic flamefest with high-camp violence and action.
24960	6	a	Only occasionally does the camp classic struggling to free itself from the constricting kimonos and white pancake makeup of 'Geisha' claw its way to the surface.
24961	4	a	At least it has a subtext, which is more than you can say for many big studio releases.
24962	7	a	Replace the mullet-wearing redneck from Joe Dirt with a burnout child actor, and you've got Dickie Roberts.
24963	3	a	"Christopher Robin"" is an uplifting bear hug of a movie. It delights, yes, but it does one better: it makes the viewer want to be a kinder, better person."
24964	9	a	If it weren't for James Caan's shyster Las Vegas lawyer, the whole, um, pornucopia would be a complete waste of time. Best to think of this as Middling Men.
24965	9	a	There's plenty of goofiness to go around in this lavish production, awash as it is in CG sunsets, slow-motion shots of blades and arrows penetrating bodies and necks, and computer-assisted pans around the Silk Road and its surrounding desert.
24966	5	a	Hoffman's directing debut delivers a film so weak I could barely remember what it was about as I left the cinema.
24967	7	a	The only story you'll find in Fantastic Four is the one attached to the last name of its director.
24968	4	a	Picture Harry Potter for Emo kids. No wonder there's already a sequel in the works. Brood on, Vin.
24969	4	a	Reveals the health club fad to be a hall of mirrors filled with self-absorbed individuals.
24970	0	a	Spielberg knows exactly how the human mind works, and he uses that knowledge to plumb the elemental fear buried deep within.
24971	5	a	If you are a Kevin James fan you probably will want to see him rolling around, otherwise you can pass on this one to save a few bucks.
24972	4	a	To say that this low-fi indie movie is strange would be doing a disservice to quirky movies that thrive on their strangeness, rather than just being strange for the sake of spicing things up.
24973	0	a	Martin McDonagh is undisputedly one of the finest scriptwriters in contemporary cinema. 
24974	5	a	...an obvious low point within this incredibly uneven series.
24975	3	a	This smartly scripted Cinderella love story is crammed with charm and the expert direction of Jon Turteltaub hits all the right emotional buttons.
24976	4	a	Clever lines, chic sets, appropriately incorporated cloying songs, and a sympathetic Debra Messing keep the film enjoyable.
24977	4	a	Wolfen goes through the paces of a typical detective thriller, but I'll bet you've never seen anything like it.
24978	6	a	...The Great New Wonderful boasts a pervasively aimless atmosphere that slowly but surely wears the viewer down and ensures that the film's overtly positive elements are ultimately rendered moot.
24979	8	a	This is by far the best film of the year, an instant classic, which embodies the very essence of cinema. If we, in Northern Ireland, are not screening this sensational film then we might as well shut down all our cinemas.
24980	5	a	This time, Jesus rather than Burt Reynolds or The Rock gets the credit for leading an underdog team of football players to victory.
24981	3	a	Not all the scenes are necessary, and a great deal of the movie is set-up, with Jackson reveling in his own return to Middle Earth. But it's an enjoyable experience.
24982	6	a	Mildly enjoyable despite its basic mediocrity ...
24983	4	a	A fluffy date movie that settles for platitudes every time it comes across an interesting idea.
24984	4	a	It's polished to the point of shallow glossiness -- it could benefit from being a little rougher, a little messier.
24985	2	a	The Artist plays like a loving homage to an era of filmmaking that many people have forgotten or never knew.
24986	0	a	Mao's Last Dancer is a masterpiece.
24987	3	a	Dave Grohl remains unflappable as a first-time director in his entertaining and informative documentary Sound City, a loving tribute to a defunct Van Nuys recording studio. 
24988	2	a	Given the propensity here for being 'outrageous', it's nice that the central foursome of players are so appealing.
24989	3	a	Like Albert, the movie dreams of a world in which the impromptu epitaph delivered by the hotel doctor might be obsolete: 'Dear Jesus, I don't know what makes people live such miserable lives.'
24990	3	a	Steinfeld is able to play Nadine at peak asshole, with huge sympathy.
24991	4	a	Simplified and conventionalised though it may be, this has to be accounted the most compelling dramatisation of Turing's story yet.
24992	2	a	Despite its occasional imperfections...Amistad must be regarded as a monumentally impressive achievement and further proof of Spielberg's ongoing maturation as an artist.
24993	1	a	There is plenty of sorrow to be found in Into the Wild But though the film's structure may be tragic, its spirit is anything but.
24994	3	a	Bolt's double identity allows young viewers to imagine the fun of owning a cuter version of Krypto while it also affirms Charles M. Schulz's assertion that happiness is a warm puppy...
24995	3	a	Once again, George Romero has made a zombie movie for the times we live in.
24996	3	a	It goes within one of the world's most filmed cities to discover an environment rarely revealed to outsiders. But it also wins kudos for the emotional honesty of its uncomplicated narrative.
24997	4	a	stupid but endearing
24998	5	a	Radio features Gooding, Jr. in a performance more akin to Justin Bartha in Gigli than Dustin Hoffman in Rain Man.
24999	9	a	"Not really sure - even after seeing the movie - what ""it"" is and why it comes at night. Low budget boring. "
25000	0	a	David Fincher has always seemed to me a talented and clever, sometimes passionate and questing, director. Now I think he's a great one. The Curious Case of Benjamin Button is a great American movie.
25001	0	a	Just when you thought you could peg a Pixar film... comes this new feature which takes those elements in a wholly unexpected direction. 
25002	5	a	Unless you're a car nut or big fan of camp, steer clear.
25003	9	a	The would-be street hoopster characters of Crossover have plenty of flashy, original moves. Sadly, the movie itself has none.
25004	3	a	A beautiful but ultimately hollow affair.
25005	5	a	What could have been an exciting action film with an engaging premise just doesn't add up to the sum of its parts.
25006	6	a	Here, [Landesman] seems to lose all track of Richard Nixon to tell the story of a bitter, conniving passed-over bureaucrat.
25007	3	a	Fans of the original will like this version, but many will ultimately see director David Fincher's film as more cookie cutter than classic. 
25008	5	a	The leading characters are so dumb, they deserve whatever they get.
25009	3	a	Who wastes time watching Tiger Woods/When real action comes from the boyz in the hoods?
25010	4	a	Ultimately stumbles and falls when over-long narrative veers off in a bizarre direction in the final reel.
25011	0	a	Yasujiro Ozu's Tokyo Story might be his masterpiece.
25012	1	a	The journey of Maximus, from triumph on the battlefield through despair and degradation in slavery and then to a final epiphany in the Colosseum is an exciting one - and Russell Crowe plays the character with considerable toughness and authority.
25013	3	a	Adoption drama probes complex anger, heartbreak, hope.
25014	7	a	Zucker and his team don't seem to be trying anymore.
25015	3	a	Director Lauren Lazin keeps us hooked by letting [Tupac] tell his story in his own words, through video clips and recorded interviews.
25016	6	a	Because the film has to split its running time among so many different characters, all of whom look alike and act alike but have different names, I got rather bored.
25017	0	a	"History becomes breathtaking drama in ""Selma""; there's an urgent realism in the storytelling, as if we're seeing this just in time. And indeed we are ..."
25018	7	a	At least Vince Vaughn, Jon Favreau and their fellow cast and crewmates were able to spend time on a gorgeous tropical island while making this mirthless, half-hearted relationship comedy.
25019	4	a	"The clever but confused ""Safety Not Guaranteed"" is loosely inspired by a classified ad, ostensibly seeking a partner for a trip back in time, which became a minor Internet sensation a few years back."
25020	6	a	MacFarlane is a joke machine. They come fast and furious, and often they're insanely funny. The bad news? His stories tend to suffer for it.
25021	3	a	[Huang's] plot may be overwritten and the ending may be less than satisfying, but his eye and ear are right.
25022	2	a	A panel in Michael Haneke's trilogy about gratuitous acts of vioelnce and their devastating effects.
25023	5	a	Thumbs aren't the only things sucking in this slight summer comedy with a tortured plot and predictable laughs.
25024	9	a	This comedy about politics in a small community must have looked good on paper, with Gene Hackman and Ray Romano on board, but it just fizzles.
25025	3	a	... it will be satisfactory for all those who love spies and political conspiracies. [Full review in Spanish]
25026	3	a	So deftly made and well performed that rather than being cloying and calculated, it ends up as charming and exhilarating.
25027	4	a	A spry teen melodrama whose refusal to pander to its audience is refreshing.
25028	1	a	The film is fascinating and complex, and benefits from a densely textured soundtrack that makes it as interesting to listen to as to watch.
25029	3	a	The prison scenes are blatantly manipulative-and effective-but Fugitive really takes off during an intense escape sequence.
25030	3	a	Even with its inconsistencies, the movie offers enough suspense to get airborne.
25031	4	a	Jamie Foxx floats gracefully through this screwball sex comedy with a cocked eyebrow and the playful smirk of an overgrown adolescent.
25032	5	a	What we have is a lot of fake and lazy attempts at humor.
25033	2	a	If you're one of this breed of Trainspotting diehards, I implore you to hold out hope at least long enough to see the surprising gloss of the movie's lens as not a betrayal, but a natural complement to the original's grit and grain.
25034	4	a	It has a way of wearing out what's supposed to be knockabout farce.
25035	6	a	The actors are fine, but the material doesn't give their talents much room to stretch.
25036	1	a	Killer's Kiss is no one's idea of a great film but it displays much evidence of future brilliance.
25037	3	a	a glorious cinematic soak
25038	3	a	This time, the hype is quieter, and while the movie is slightly less successful than the first, it's still a rollicking good time for the most part.
25039	2	a	'A vivid and dazzling depiction of the Cuban landscape and culture but also a weak plot that barely supports the intricate, detailed visuals.'
25040	9	a	This movie is lost from the start and never finds its way. Plays like a video game with repetitive special effects and wooden dialogue.
25041	4	a	The character of Beetlejuice is hazy because the writers can never decide if he's a villain or an anti-hero...
25042	3	a	as slick as the sales philosophy of its characters tempered with a palpable anger at what Madison Avenue hath wrought
25043	3	a	Sex, cinema and fate -- three of Pedro Almodovar's favorite subjects -- are lovingly examined in his Broken Embraces.
25044	3	a	Veronica Mars retains all of the humor and intriguing human dimension it possessed while on the air.
25045	6	a	The Tourist is like a beautifully decorated shop window -- with no shop behind it.
25046	0	a	Feels both fresh and vintage, and watching it, you can almost feel the warm Italian sun and smell the fresh breeze billowing through the orchards. A trip to a bucolic place of young love and intellectual rigour, it's an intoxicating work.
25047	3	a	This one's worth the price of admission for the music alone.
25048	1	a	More than just tics and hurried mannerisms, Cage's Roy is a percolating time bomb of emotional baggage, the actor delving deep inside the tortured grifter's inner demons.
25049	3	a	Fans of the original film will certainly be pleased with this sequel.
25050	6	a	"Fate, mythology and even racism in America are tossed in to a climax so grim it's like watching ""Men in Black"" morph into ""Requiem for a Dream."" The movie doesn't earn that drama, feeling cobbled together from earlier, less-commercial drafts."
25051	6	a	It has nice little touches, and some solid performances, but in the end nothing is accomplished. It is as though the film itself is unemployed.
25052	4	a	Does start off slowly and is consistently hobbled by Duris' bland performance and the equally bland character he portrays, but eventually it settles into a pleasing rhythm and mood.
25053	6	a	The filmmakers have taken the source material -- Arthur Golden's best-selling novel -- and turned it into a glossy Hollywood production with the overripe melodrama you'd expect from a television soap opera, not a supposed epic drama.
25054	6	a	The film certainly is technically impressive, sharp as a diamond, but its story, adapted by Jean-Christophe Castelli from Ben Fountain's book, is oddly flat, only a few characters really coming to life.
25055	1	a	No Country for Old Men is based on a novel by Cormac McCarthy, but it shows all the Coen strengths. One is a genuine interest in the way people work.
25056	0	a	Great performances from Crowe and Phoenix.
25057	0	a	Brilliant... beautiful and incredibly moving.
25058	4	a	Fun, one-of-a-kind, and sometimes scary, adventure/comedy with the always-delightful, John Lithgow.
25059	3	a	Perhaps the only time in history a movie was far better than its source material
25060	4	a	A mildly amusing mess.
25061	0	a	From cast to conclusion, Revolutionary Road is fate funneled through a true artist's muse.
25062	7	a	With so many storylines battling for supremacy, Country Strong never conveys who these people are and is often inconsistent in portraying them.
25063	3	a	An accurate subtitle might be 'Dial M for Marriage.'
25064	3	a	If there's one reason why you should see this film, it's to admire the wonderful performances from Bradley Cooper and Jennifer Lawrence.
25065	6	a	While Resurrection provides a few precious moments of personal and social insight, it's basically just another product line in the endless marketing of Shakur as an urban martyr.
25066	2	a	It's an adrenaline-fuelled film full of big jolts, black humour and a nicely building sense of foreboding and dread.
25067	4	a	There are precious few characters who don't look and sound like they just got back from molesting Ned Beatty alongside the Georgia river. But the movie somewhat works thanks to a solid second half and some sharp performances.
25068	6	a	Writer-director Gary David Goldberg relies so much on the predetermined beats of sitcom writing that Must Love Dogs is too stiff to qualify as lightweight.
25069	3	a	The Artist is superfluous, but charming through-and-through, painted with lively performances, staggering cinematography and a lovely spirit of nostalgia.
25070	5	a	A movie like Hotel For Dogs is so carefully demographically targeted, it takes the guesswork out of deciding whether to go. It is not a movie that kids and adults will enjoy equally.
25071	4	a	I think it was a mistake to have Christian Bale play Bateman quite as goofy as he does, but it's a terrific performance within its boundaries.
25072	4	a	Generic thriller.
25073	4	a	In her most impressive role to date, Tina Fey plays a journalist in the throes of an identity crisis. Alas, her movie has one too. 
25074	1	a	"First Reformed"" captures the despair that good and decent people can feel, looking at a world that seems to have turned its back on goodness and decency. "
25075	2	a	It speaks to us all about the stories and experiences that make up a life, and the complicated relationships that we carry with us to the grave.
25076	4	a	This movie has charm to spare and it's hard to resist.
25077	0	a	One of the best films of this middle-aged decade.
25078	6	a	There is no question Nim was exploited for human gain, yet there are important aspects which Marsh leaves unexplored.
25079	1	a	Few things get better with age. Among the things that do: a good Scotch and, in his latest incarnation, Bond... James Bond.
25080	9	a	Third art-house wuxia in a row with Zhang Ziyi the subject of violent sexual advances -- but the first that seems to take an unhealthy interest in the whole business.
25081	6	a	Early on, this urbane update tells us what we've learned in the intervening decades -- women are from Venus, Alfies are from Mars -- then proceeds to restate that view of the solar system ad nauseum.
25082	5	a	Eat Pray Love is a two hour and fifteen minute ad for being rich; it's a smug, patronising travelogue that -- despite its already apt title -- could have also been called First World Problems: The Movie. 
25083	0	a	I treasure movies such as this - movies that put you in a location, allow you to soak up the details, and constantly take you places you don't anticipate going. No Country For Old Men is a masterpiece.
25084	5	a	What we have is a character faced with the possibility that her life is meaningless, vapid and devoid of substance, in a movie that is definitely meaningless, vapid and devoid of substance.
25085	4	a	Schindler's List is a ruthlessly unsentimental portrait of a German war profiteer's epiphany that inspires neither sorrow nor pity, but a kind of emotional numbness.
25086	7	a	So niche-marketed to gamers that it might as well not be considered a film at all: It's a marketing tie-in, albeit one with some exceptional production values.
25087	6	a	While the suspense-thriller may not be a good movie, it's sort of entertaining and funny.
25088	4	a	Romero's long-awaited zombie horror flick delivers lashings of gore, violent action sequences and big dollops of heavy-handed satire in equal measure.
25089	3	a	Laced with great shock moments, Bourne moves along smartly on its own steam, drawing us confidently into its orbit.
25090	4	a	Performances are solid and the washed-out, blue-tinged cinematography lends a sickish aura to the soul-eroding cubicles, offices and conference rooms that all too vividly evoke the mind-set of depressed wage slaves.
25091	6	a	Something like Ocean's Eleven and its various numerations, except with muscle cars and knuckleheads and without the laughs.
25092	4	a	It's not much of a movie, but it's a mostly good time with old friends.
25093	1	a	"The Artist"" may be too cute to qualify as high art, but it's highly entertaining."
25094	3	a	Miami Vice is stylish and slick. It visually smacks you in the head and makes you pay attention. 
25095	9	a	If you ever have the choice of being trapped, halfway up a mountain, or of watching this movie, than I advise you to don that parka and long underwear.
25096	9	a	I found myself missing Jeff Spicoli.
25097	0	a	The clever, light-hearted manner that the flurry of philosophical inquiries are tossed our way kept a smile on my face and gave me that warm, fuzzy feeling inside
25098	1	a	A riotous film that finds depth, clarity and refreshment in even the shallowest of pools.
25099	9	a	I would rather watch all the Pokemon movies, back to back, than waste my time watching this production for a second time.
25100	5	a	Fans of melodrama will enjoy this juicy item that sometimes seems Hitchcockian in tone but most of the time exists in a world of its own.
25101	4	a	It is a notch above the usual tripe we get from MTV films - but it's not a very big notch
25102	4	a	The problem is that your safety is guaranteed - everyone is too likeable for there to be any sense of danger.
25103	2	a	It's Spielberg's sloppiest film since Hook, but still has enough moments that transcend simple nostalgia to make it worthwhile even if it is an uneven thrill ride.
25104	10	a	We can only hope this excrement masquerading as humor will bury the gross-out genre once and for all.
25105	2	a	Bening finds the shattered beauty in Grahame, the tragedy of an ex-star hanging on for dear life to her waning looks and fame that has long since passed her by.
25106	6	a	Marginally engaging and amusing, but often lazy, meandering, unenlightening, excessively facile and underwhelming.
25107	3	a	An earnest inspirational drama that mostly transcends its formulaic trappings.
25108	6	a	Inspired by Tarantino's Reservoir Dogs and countless films about seemingly perfect heists that go uproariously wrong, Armored is an unpretentious, fast-moving, action-packed thriller but emotionally hollow.
25109	4	a	s there a heart-wrenching back story to explain why Diana is the way she is? Yes. Did I laugh? Yes. 
25110	1	a	Project Nim borrows a page or nine from the Errol Morris handbook, crafting its extraordinary story out of an operatic mix of crisply framed interviews, archival footage, and well-staged recreations.
25111	3	a	A creative family-friendly adventure that's a clear step above most of the other animated options currently vying for families' attention.
25112	4	a	Making your way through the film is like eating an entire beautifully sculpted wedding cake.
25113	5	a	It's like a showcase for actors to be seen by agents and casting directors, except this ensemble is already made of stars and celebrities. 
25114	2	a	Literally bananas. And also nuts.
25115	2	a	The Light Between Oceans is a visually and thematically cohesive package, though its characters feel emotionally an arm's length away.
25116	1	a	This movie enlightens as much as it entertains.
25117	4	a	It's stylishly directed by John Moore, and his actors don't embarrass themselves, despite the iffy premise.
25118	2	a	A fast-paced and frequently hilarious spoof of the old-school rap world.
25119	6	a	The plot device of young men who refuse to mature has never felt more exhausted, maybe because these actors or ones who look like them have already done this shtick in other movies.
25120	4	a	Astro Boy succeeds at creating a complex world filled with second-class robots and sometimes careless, greedy humans, providing food for thought and animated thrills for adults and kids alike.
25121	9	a	Subtlety is never this movie's strong point; then again, it's nearly impossible to pinpoint what this movie's strengths are.
25122	4	a	Watch it, and laugh at the truth about love.
25123	8	a	Hackford fails to squeeze the tiniest bit of juice, sexy or comic or otherwise, out of the chintzy-libertine locale.
25124	9	a	Despite Robert Englund's cheerful ghoulishness, there is nothing about Freddy Kreuger that justifies his iconic status... as this dismal sequel demonstrates.
25125	5	a	"First computer animated movie to ""star"" actors."
25126	4	a	While Paltrow belts out the title anthem with conviction, it is the younger performers who sing more intimate, and moving, numbers that advance the story rather than merely stating it.
25127	3	a	... it doesn't take itself too seriously, and for the most part it's just a jolly entertaining romp of a revenge flick.
25128	4	a	Antal keenly juggles black comedy, character types and genre styles, making the most of the weird angles and inherent dark creepiness of his chosen backdrop.
25129	4	a	Star-driven comedy at times offensive and funny.
25130	0	a	Jenkins couldn't have found actors more suited to straddle the delicate, subtle line between detestable and sympathetic.
25131	4	a	What keeps the whole thing from toppling into an abyss of unwatchable TV drama histrionics is a pair of dynamite performances from Annette Bening and Naomi Watts.
25132	4	a	The movie to flunk a crucial test: 'If I saw this on TV, would it involve the word Hallmark in any way?'
25133	4	a	It works if all you're looking for is a movie you can take your children to see.
25134	6	a	American Dreamz suffers from an overabundance of subplots and characters.
25135	6	a	Hoffman is stymied by the difficult task of transforming stage material into a movie; Jack Goes Boating's camera just sits there while actors act.
25136	3	a	This Southern-fried, darkly humorous trailer-trash exploitation crime noir revels in the greedy characters' idiocy and the deranged story's psychosexual luridness. 
25137	3	a	One of the pleasures of Edge of Seventeen is it makes you nostalgic for high school yet so relieved it's over.
25138	1	a	"As in [his first film] ""Krisha,"" the most fraught and dangerous relationships are those of family and those who purport to be friends. For all of their flesh-eating ferocity, zombies won't lie to you or play games. Only the living do that."
25139	0	a	It makes Independence Day look like The Muppet Movie.
25140	3	a	In addition to its provocative dialogue, Bicentennial Man features some cute scenes of the future city.
25141	3	a	This is exactly the right kind of movie fun for a scorching hot summer day when your brain is too tired to think and will settle for being amused.
25142	1	a	...a magnificent human drama that sends us searching for messages in a thick blanket of emotional pain...
25143	3	a	Undoubtedly one of the most romantic movies of all time...
25144	1	a	One of the everlasting Hitchcockian masterpieces.
25145	6	a	OK as far as it goes, which is not far enough.
25146	6	a	Just like the game, which is an achievement and a disappointment all in one.
25147	10	a	This couldn't even excite me as a kid. A bad film.
25148	6	a	An opportunity squandered by Marvel, which really needs to watch its quality control more closely.
25149	5	a	The high wattage of stars Johnny Depp and Angelina Jolie cast the film in a spotlight that would be unflattering for most movies, least of all an insubstantial, tension-free thriller like this.
25150	9	a	An amalgam of the Alien and Terminator films, only without the style.
25151	9	a	And just when things are poised to get interesting, the movie goes nowhere really, really fast.
25152	3	a	The film starts to pick up after it begins borrowing liberally from The Omen, even more liberally than the film's two predecessors which, as freak-accident horror films, are by definition Omen clones.
25153	2	a	Logan Lucky doesn't try to be something it's not and with its somewhat charming nature, it's a heist film that knows how to keep it light without losing its edge.
25154	4	a	can be viewed more like an exercise in style than film in its own right
25155	1	a	My jaw ached by the end of the film, because I had been grinning nonstop for two hours.
25156	5	a	It's as substantial as seeing The Exorcist redone on Snapchat - and let's not even consider the implication of casting black and Latino performers as Satan's minions, because clearly its makers haven't.
25157	3	a	"American Hustle"" is a good film that could have been great had it not gone into hibernation through its middle portion. However, thanks to one of the year's best ensembles and Russell's keen eye for direction it becomes an enjoyable romp."
25158	1	a	One dazzling feat of derring-do follows another, defying descriptions in the speed and bravura of Chan's martial artistry.
25159	4	a	It references the original constantly, but rather than reigniting the subversive energetic joy, it just makes you miss it.
25160	9	a	Despite a basic premise that's ripe with promise, the film leaps way over the top with a key performance while also succumbing to some silly cliches.
25161	7	a	Much like the many 'Jesus' movies, the film stays clear of controversy and plays it safe, making the casting of Jim Caviezel even more ironical.
25162	2	a	Although the movie is a family favorite, the DVD treatment is rather shoddy.
25163	1	a	A fitting dramatic tribute to the deadly brinksmanship that pulled us back from the edge during the most volatile two weeks of the Cold War.
25164	2	a	Cinematographer Sharon Meir and film editor Peter Berger brilliantly capture the magic, thrills and extraordinary talent of the fear-inspired players, putting their hearts and souls into the game.
25165	3	a	Paranoid Park, the new Gus Van Sant movie, is slight but fascinating.
25166	4	a	Overly romanticized.
25167	3	a	I liked The Curious Case of Benjamin Button, but I wanted to love it.
25168	6	a	After its silly last installment, this series is now showing signs of growth and maturity but not enough to recommend the new feature.
25169	3	a	An enjoyable-enough night at the movies, though it's not as well-crafted as its predecessor.
25170	4	a	There's nothing much to the film besides its pretty-coolness. Fundamentally it goes nowhere and says nothing.
25171	5	a	There is no hilarity, just a couple of veteran funnymen going through the hellishly predictable motions in this unimaginative and unnecessary sequel.
25172	4	a	I got a lot of pleasure from Sausage Party, though not as much pleasure as the foodstuffs derive from the frenzied concluding orgy ...
25173	7	a	The Cloverfield Paradox concerns an energy crisis on Earth, and yet the greater concern is the energy crisis onscreen. 
25174	4	a	Mendes wants to combine a Bourne-like lack of quips and frippery with Christopher Nolan-ish solemnity and gigantism ...
25175	5	a	Cox seems to have zero vision telling a story that should be way more compelling than what we get here.
25176	6	a	A thriller driven by considerable suspense before taking a wrong exit somewhere near the end.
25177	7	a	It's a war story that should be felt, but instead tells you how to feel.
25178	3	a	Director Ang Lee returns with an earthy, timely contemplation about the war in Iraq, homeland apathy, virgin soldiers, heroism and first love. It's a wart-ridden drama with moments of piercing honesty that strike at the heart of a conflicted America. 
25179	6	a	There are zero sparks between [the leads]. ... It seems the only reason these two are together is because they're both on the movie poster.
25180	4	a	The longer this one remains in the air, the less inspired it becomes.
25181	0	a	"Re-imagining ""The Nightmare Before Christmas"" as a three dimensional film has taken Henry Selick's modern masterwork and turned it into a timeless classic."
25182	3	a	The best monster movie in years.
25183	4	a	With Factory Girl, Hickenlooper has taken an icon and made her ordinary.
25184	4	a	An eleventh hour twist adds a bit of intrigue, and everyone - including Haley himself, as a henchman - seems to be having a pretty good time.
25185	7	a	Vile, evil and brutal, it's a bloody mess that's only saved by Matthew McConaughey's impressively repellent acting.
25186	6	a	The central performances are excellent if not capable of being too finely cut given the meandering, dare I say roving, narrative.
25187	3	a	Zhao brings a documentarian's eye to his story, augmented with some striking photography making the most of the movie's picturesque Badlands geography.
25188	6	a	The whole film is a series of frenetically-edited action sequences and bizarre set-pieces roughly stitched together to form some kind of whole. It's been made with tongue firmly in cheek and is often funny for it.
25189	7	a	"A trio of thinly-drawn narratives that combine into one triply disappointing mega-""meh"", it doesn't so much ask questions about the afterlife as threaten to."
25190	5	a	Watching Fast Five is like being savagely beaten for two hours and ten minutes by the staff at Advance Auto Parts.
25191	9	a	Rent-a-cop bullplop.
25192	3	a	How much time do we want to spend with people who would love to have keggers when they're on the verge of buying a second home?
25193	8	a	A film so boring, overextended and endlessly moronic that my high school called to downgrade my GPA for having sat through it.
25194	4	a	Not a bad movie at all, but it's nothing amazing either. [Full review in Spanish]
25195	3	a	A moody, nasty-minded crime movie full of rage and anchored by some deep, moody visuals.
25196	1	a	Fincher delves once again into the bowels of our uber-psyche -- quite literally in the propulsive, Dust Brothers-scored opening credits sequence -- and announces that a lot of us are walking very close to the edge.
25197	3	a	Classic science fiction that is well-worth seeing.
25198	3	a	There is so much goodwill here, you are charmed as much as tickled into laughing.
25199	6	a	Going to see Wedding Date is like going on a date with me. It is moderately pleasant, but you are not going to do it a second time because you know you can do better.
25200	0	a	Rango is like Chinatown meets A Fistful of Dollars meets a Geico commercial. And it's totally awesome.
25201	4	a	At first it's fun to watch the characters ... But then you notice a coldness in the eyes, a mechanical quality in the movements.
25202	4	a	A Royal Night Out goes the zany romantic-comedy route in its fictional depiction of two British princesses partying with commoners at the end of World War II.
25203	10	a	Incredibly irritating...shrill, sappy and sadly sitcomish.
25204	4	a	The balance tilts away from characters and mystery toward messages. 
25205	4	a	A slick, well- photographed film.
25206	5	a	Russo and Russo can't decide whether they're making a sentimental farce about male friendship or a raunchy comedy spiced up with porn. The latter wins out, though the audience is the loser.
25207	3	a	The visuals are stunning, the battles are exciting and the supporting cast is strong. Why, then, did Disney stupidly do everything they could to ensure that it would fail?
25208	5	a	The film is so flamboyantly gory and disgusting, so vulgar and in-your-face obnoxious, with so many offensive subplots and wacked-out elements that you may give up long before you need to reach for your second headache tablet.
25209	1	a	Often disquieting, always haunting, and ultimately horrific, [The Ring] is one of the few films that approaches The Exorcist in its ability to terrify.
25210	2	a	I was impressed with how much of the story's good humor Jackson and Co. manage to weave into the spectacle. It's there in the close shave with a gang of hungry trolls, and it really lifts off once Andy Serkis' uncanny Gollum enters the picture.
25211	3	a	Hancock is a lot of fun, if perhaps a little top-heavy with stuff being destroyed.
25212	6	a	Nealon's bizarre, meandering Aliens in the Attic performance is almost, mind you only almost, worth seeing.
25213	3	a	Superbly plays out as a backstreet atmospheric subtle topical cat-and-mouse espionage game.
25214	6	a	The script by Billy Ray and Peter A. Dowling contains plot holes the size of an Airbus.
25215	6	a	...routine, harmless diversion and little else.
25216	9	a	I, Frankenstein is like the worst piece of Mary Shelley fan fiction written by the guy behind the counter at your local Hot Topic.
25217	1	a	...a touching look at old age and how memories from the past can affect us as mature beings.
25218	0	a	This is a story about the most immutable force in nature and all the delirious highs and lows it imparts. Carol argues that yes, love hurts. But man, does it feel good.
25219	3	a	Taking what John G. Avildsen accomplished with the first film and then adding his own style, Stallone comes forward as an action visionary, with the fight scene a vast improvement when compared to the original.
25220	9	a	It's just too bad the movie didn't indulge its spookier, supernatural elements more, instead of relying on action movie cliches.
25221	1	a	War of the Worlds is a terrifying potential vision of our own self inflicted doomsday, masquerading as a summer blockbuster.
25222	6	a	Vacillates wildly between the scattered pearls of comic classics and bone-tired comic convention.
25223	0	a	It's the rare chance to glimpse the doodles of an auteur.
25224	5	a	Murray completists -- I count myself among them -- will flock to it, but will probably come away disappointed at how not-weird this oddball film actually is.
25225	4	a	Watchable drama enlivened by strong performances from both Glenn Close and Janet McTeer, though the story loses its way in the second half and fails to deliver the required emotional punch.
25226	3	a	Clint Eastwood's best film since Unforgiven is another look at murder, death and the good in men that can die long before they do.
25227	2	a	The film is long and deliberate and slow of pulse -- quite appropriately. But Weir is a real filmmaker, and he handles vast landscapes and delicate death scenes with equal doses of invention, vitality, dignity and taste.
25228	1	a	Remains a beautiful, deftly directed and superbly acted version of a witty and poignant drama.
25229	6	a	Absent of the edgy suspense, creativity and thoughtful moments of existentialism that had previously made this horror series more than just a cheap study in evisceration and decapitations.
25230	1	a	Dafoe's interpretation of the real Max Schreck's vampire is hypnotic, and the transitions between clips from the real Nosferatu and Merhige's recreation of the shooting of those same scenes is simply magical.
25231	5	a	A contrived, formulaic, heavy-handed melodrama about camaraderie and the value of female solidarity.
25232	1	a	Every shot is suitable for framing.
25233	3	a	Unlike typical romantic genre fare, its jagged edges will make the characters and film a challenge for some viewers, which is the reason why others embrace it.
25234	4	a	Spy Kids is a frivolous but fun adventure movie that will give kids thrills and adults some smiles. Everybody goes home happy.
25235	5	a	Lazarus is mired in the predictability of its genre conventions, showing its cards on the table before actually playing them.
25236	5	a	It would be difficult to care less about all this.
25237	3	a	Sweet and sincere.
25238	5	a	Even if Van Cleef is a one-dimensional actor, he nevertheless has a tremendous screen presence.
25239	5	a	This is an all-fudging, all-sludging Cheesepocalypse Now of a movie.
25240	6	a	Parts of this romantic science fiction story are undeniably interesting. Others require a strong suspension of disbelief and even then I was scratching my head.
25241	2	a	Surprisingly good acting by the real people about whom the movie is made add to the verisimilitude, even though the setup is too slow for such a rapid, but heroic, climax.
25242	9	a	Less a spirited defense of tolerance and equality than a facile, only fitfully funny burlesque.
25243	9	a	Incredibly boring and badly acted.
25244	0	a	A potent metaphor for the betrayal of principles, the souring of the American Dream, and an intelligent mediation on the corrupting nature of power.
25245	3	a	Light It Up challenges the bureaucratic structure that condemns many children to an educational purgatory.
25246	7	a	Somewhere in this film is the germ of a really good comedy, but they blew it.
25247	0	a	Engrossing, funny, very sad, very moving and very uplifting.
25248	4	a	'Paper Towns' is an admirable film more due to what it tries to do, than to the final product, and although it does entertain, it could've done a lot more. [Full review in Spanish]
25249	3	a	Take away the typical lush life or hard life images you associate with rap, and Shakur's struggles are common
25250	3	a	Beautifully shot, brilliantly scored by John Barry and sensitively staged by director James Hill, this charming adaptation of Joy Adamson's bestseller is one of the great animal films.
25251	1	a	A sharp, witty movie that finally answers the age-old question: what do chickens do when you're not looking?
25252	4	a	Franz Kafka Meets 'Scientific Socialism' tells more about the state of Cuba today that many more learned treatises.
25253	1	a	...deftly mixes comedy with adventure and romance to make this an extremely well-rounded film.
25254	0	a	Moody and stylish, and McQueen is cool as ever.
25255	4	a	The third-act twists that sink Jackie Earle Haley's directorial debut are downright Criminal.
25256	3	a	I've read the novel and seen the movie twice, and I've given up worrying about the plot. It doesn't matter.
25257	5	a	Like the show itself, as much as there is a ton of style on offer, there is little in the way of real substance
25258	4	a	Aesthetically stunning and armed with a sophisticated lining of suspense, Crimson Peak does not necessarily exude any real momentum of toxic scares or memorable chills. Still, it manages to rely on its Gothic-induced romanticism that is enough 
25259	3	a	A genial, shambling little film with characters it's possible to care about even when you don't necessarily like them.
25260	3	a	This is, apparently, how the world ends. Not with a whimper, but a laugh.
25261	5	a	a leisurely thriller, more interesting than heart-stopping, with an unfortunate tendency to stall
25262	0	a	Anderson succeeds in creating a world all its own, rich in atmosphere and detail... Phoenix holds the film together with his amusing performance as a guy who doesn't take himself too seriously.
25263	1	a	It may be true, as Salieri says, that 'mediocrity is everywhere'--but not in this classic composition.
25264	1	a	There's truth to it. Turing's story is indeed hard to imagine. Thanks to Cumberbatch's committed performance, a lot more people will know it.
25265	6	a	Never excites as much as it indulges the senses with a creepiness.
25266	5	a	The off-putting CGI Chipmunks coast through a derivative, squeaky-voiced adventure with fleeting moments of charm.
25267	1	a	A treat, courtesy of its clever premise, rich music and cinematography, and an enthusiastic cast gleefully overdoing their German accents.
25268	5	a	Mooseport wears out its welcome fairly quickly.
25269	7	a	The picture's combination of stylistic splash and pretentious turgidity makes for a long slog. It may be accurate, but by the time it drags to an end, you won't really care.
25270	1	a	A conventional but wholly gripping docudrama.
25271	0	a	Though it had a poor box office upon its release, it eventually became recognized as a masterpiece.
25272	7	a	One of the big problems with this film compiled out of big problems: it has awful characters, and awful performances bringing them to life.
25273	8	a	if this film doesn't kill your taste for Martin Lawrence, you'll get him again next month when he stars in the sure-to-be-dreadful College Road Trip
25274	3	a	Frantically and refreshingly fun.
25275	8	a	Doesn't contain a single scary or imaginative moment.
25276	4	a	Palo Alto doesn't play like a ticking time bomb. Instead, the film is empathetic to a fault ...
25277	4	a	There's no edge, but if you're young enough to not know the original version of I Want You To Want Me, Bandslam may have charms enough to tickle your tweenage heart.
25278	3	a	"The joy of reconnecting to your own inner child and to your family is not just the theme of ""Christopher Robin."" It is the experience of watching it."
25279	9	a	What a bummer.
25280	5	a	This lackluster production fails to generate much in the way of tension and less in the way of merriment.
25281	5	a	"Smoke"" follow-up lacks the first flick's spark and humor."
25282	7	a	There are more problems afoot than just its misleading rating, beginning with the story itself.
25283	0	a	The movie is beautifully shot, and succeeds in being deeply disturbing and mysterious, with richly achieved nuances of characterisation. I have seen it two or three times now, and each time it gets better.
25284	9	a	[Director] John Pasquin brings to it a heavy-handedness more appropriate to the subject matter of, say, his telefilm Don't Touch My Daughter.
25285	3	a	The Western, with its code of short tempers and cheap life, sprang from the Civil War, but few Westerns connect the dots to demonstrate how the war must have created hollow nihilists the way Jonah Hex does.
25286	3	a	It's Fincher's picture, and his universe is one of exquisite fakery and frequent, elegant visual delight.
25287	3	a	While things occasionally get a bit too quirky, the young leads - Nick Robinson, Gabriel Basso and Moises Arias - make it work.
25288	2	a	The movie may not soar, but it flies.
25289	5	a	Eastwood's attempt to pay homage to these real-life people is noble, but the way he does it shows his worst side, taking a step back in his work. [Full Review in Spanish]
25290	1	a	McDormand is superb. Likewise Bale and Nivola.
25291	5	a	Without a fully-formed perspective on its protagonist, Fresh remains a picture that is more powerful and affecting in concept than in actual execution.
25292	6	a	Pitched at a level of interpersonal experience amid the mayhem, this blockbuster offers no sense of loss. Given its ending, you'd think the power had been out for a few days.
25293	9	a	Stambrini's dialogue seems especially dull, and the screenplay lacks dramatic urgency.
25294	1	a	The new script raises the emotional stakes of the old scenes it retains, cuts plot elements that can't be updated and creates new story lines that are just as effective as those it replaces.
25295	4	a	More country pop than country classic, Country Strong puts its characters through the dramatic wringer ... but only skims the surface of their emotional minefields.
25296	7	a	Despite the movie, the highlight of this three-disc set is the often hilarious commentary.
25297	6	a	All this visual caffeine is in service to a story that isn't worth telling, and that too frequently resorts to the cheap technique of putting an adorable little girl in peril, then cutting away.
25298	3	a	The entire cast from the series appears in the film, and at least a few seem poised for breakout status, especially Nathan Fillion.
25299	2	a	While it's overlong and sometimes disjointed, this heist flick delivers genuinely likable characters, winning performances and solid laughs.
25300	3	a	Resolutely, gloriously old-school in every regard, The Flight of the Phoenix is a reminder that disaster films don't need the threat of global annihilation to be good entertainment.
25301	6	a	You begin to sit trembling in your seat, terrified of the next puppy shot. They will haunt your dreams and torment your soul.
25302	6	a	...the stars are trapped in a series of nonsensical shenanigans and whiz-bang hardware wars.
25303	4	a	Punctuated with musical set pieces that are among the best ever created for the screen.
25304	4	a	The acting is sloppy, the story convoluted, the finale anticlimactic. But because this is not just a zombie movie, but one made by the undisputed zombie master, it's easier to forgive the lapses.
25305	3	a	A well-acted and effective drama -- when writer-director Rodrigo Garcia allows it to move along./
25306	3	a	Superficial? You betcha. But eye candy, attitude and humor abound in what amounts to a glorified Miami Vice episode complete with an undercover lawman who lives aboard a boat.
25307	9	a	When it's over, you may feel like cutting off your own hand for having paid good money at the ticket counter.
25308	6	a	One of those headed-for-cable oddities that must have sounded like a good idea at the time.
25309	3	a	...Spade and Farley are so good together...
25310	4	a	I was really hoping there'd been some misunderstanding about the title and this would turn out to be Eli Roth's Hostel for Dogs.
25311	3	a	It's a nice way to pass the time until Halloween
25312	3	a	A comedy that, if not exactly a gutbuster, is one that is consistently charming, and that is due to the fresh voice and presence of writer/star Nia Vardalos.
25313	4	a	a warm and fuzzy film that somehow manages to avoid the trap of becoming cloying. It finds piquant and pithy humor and pathos in watching grown-ups who don't quite know what they want
25314	2	a	A historically respectful, morally careful film.
25315	4	a	its romanticized perspective makes it all seem in hindsight a bit shallow and facile
25316	4	a	It's slight, sure, and there's a better, less-glossy film buried in the material, but warm performances redeem Crowe's agreeable return.
25317	7	a	Coarse, cliched and clunky, this trifling romantic comedy in which opposites attract for no better reason than that the screenplay demands it squanders the charms of stars Hugh Grant and Sandra Bullock.
25318	3	a	This is a smart, complex and intelligent movie, from a filmmaker at the top of his game. Banderas delivers a cultured performance, though really the full ensemble deserve great credit.
25319	2	a	absurd situation creates lasting images that don't diminish with time
25320	9	a	If the film is intended as a viciously satirical jab at Hollywood gentrification, it certainly hits its mark. It just isn't at all enjoyable to watch.
25321	9	a	The movie takes itself so seriously; it has eliminated all possibility of fun. You'd be better off going back to the video game and skipping the doomed movie version.
25322	1	a	"The Kings Of Summer sets the bar on ""coming of age"" movies a little bit higher than most, utilizing feel-good filmmaking and childhood nostalgia to carry us through an enchanting story of transformation."
25323	3	a	Despite Russell's self-indulgent streak, he earns credit for his ambition, for imbuing a stellar cast with his own bizarre spirit, and for pulling it off with wit and style.
25324	6	a	Might as well just be an extended episode of 'Family Guy' set in the West.
25325	6	a	While it's pretty effervescent for the first hour, things really take a dire turn toward the end. The whole thing nearly becomes undone at that point.
25326	3	a	This is a fun film. These characters aren't the sharpest tools in the shed and they make a few mistakes along the way.
25327	7	a	"A high-concept, high-minded piece of pseudointellectual trash, ""I Heart Huckabees"" is one of those stink bombs the intelligentsia like to champion."
25328	3	a	Dazzling and subversive satire on boss-employee relations.
25329	6	a	A television-sized adventure populated by thinly constructed sidekicks and a hero suffering from Han Solo envy.
25330	6	a	In the end, The Soloist can take a bow for its effort but shouldn't be expecting any encores.
25331	2	a	Clearly achieves what Goldthwait wanted it to, and the unapologetic bluntness of it is itself worthy of praise, however awkward and squeamish.
25332	3	a	Lovingly crafted and beautifully told, Philomena is one of this year's highlights. 
25333	4	a	A terrific cast, a gloomy tone and a few well-placed little bits of magic and real history bring a long-ago time and place to life.
25334	8	a	If this is what teenagers want as entertainment, as a society, we're in deeper trouble than we realize.
25335	3	a	A well-researched model of the true-crime genre...[and] close cinematic relative of Larry Clark's Bully.
25336	6	a	"Another insanely overrated ""classic"" which no one can remember why was once given such praise."
25337	1	a	Brutal and intense, it's an enigmatic, metaphysical mindgame.
25338	2	a	The two leads are raw but completely intriguing, and Poetic Justice offers a slice of the urban story that we generally don't get to see.
25339	6	a	Mark Felt may have been The Man Who Brought Down the White House, but his film feels like a missed opportunity to tell the story behind the story.
25340	5	a	Too real to be escapist and too sitcom-ish to be realistic... not dramatic enough to be a drama, not comedic enough to be comedy....
25341	3	a	Logan Lucky is both a Robin Hood fantasy and a uniquely Soderberghian lark, an ensemble comedy that's simultaneously effervescent and cerebral. 
25342	2	a	Vantage Point takes a pretty high concept, dribbles a bunch of red herrings all over it, and makes things go boom, reaping better yields than the average TV show.
25343	2	a	Stay away from all reviews/spoilers of this film, including mine, until you have seen it for yourself. If you're a fan of the series, you will not be disappointed. 
25344	8	a	Fails to meet even the extremely low threshold of believability required for a screwball comedy. 
25345	6	a	Too pat when it needs to be hairy, Must Love Dogs fails to find the undercurrents of complex emotion beneath its pretty patter surface.
25346	0	a	Quibble here and there over a sequence or a subplot that occasionally drifts off course from Skyfall's narrowly focused story, but this is a film that roars with enthusiasm, guts, and a sense of freedom from genre conventions.
25347	4	a	Had the Nolans held their cards closer to their vests for the first half of the film, The Prestige would have been one of the best of the year.
25348	3	a	Melissa McCarthy is riveting in simply-penned moments of remorse and confession, adding tearful depth to her ace timing and formidable physical comedy.
25349	2	a	It's a great American story.
25350	6	a	Cianfrance never squeezes the life out of his picture, but like a hug that overstays its welcome, its doting embrace is too tight for comfort.
25351	3	a	best action film of the summer
25352	6	a	What's next, Clint Eastwood as Gandhi?
25353	4	a	There must be a better reason to have a baby than to provide a plot point in a rom-com. Don't you think?
25354	0	a	A welcome ray of sunshine.
25355	5	a	When artists worry about what big corporations might do after they buy the rights to their creations, Disney's Christopher Robin is exactly what they're worried about.
25356	3	a	The movie is intense and stylized, and bristling with great performances.
25357	3	a	Graff has wonderfully captured not just the emotional havoc of adolescence but its passionate belief in music as a life-changing force.
25358	4	a	If... you [get] the impression that this is all too precious and contrived for a Hollywood film, you're not far from the mark.
25359	3	a	A colorful portrayal of friendship, the transformative power of music and an examination of Los Angeles homelessness that entertains as well as it informs.
25360	3	a	It's big, it's garish, it's loud, and most of all, it's wonderful.
25361	10	a	In the unlikely event that you've ever been truly curious as to how much M.F.A.-style toxic masculinity can be packed into one motion picture, you ought to check out The Vanishing of Sidney Hall.
25362	5	a	Oh dear. Clint Eastwood, what have you done?
25363	5	a	A straightforward revenge drama with added gore.
25364	1	a	One big inside joke where you're rewarded in huge laughs if you know the info.
25365	3	a	Most of the actors perform wonderful re-creations of the original song that give Cadillac Records entertainment value well beyond the hackneyed story lines.
25366	8	a	There's no magic here, only incompetence.
25367	4	a	Where it falters is on the script level. Screenwriters distilled so many familiar science-fiction plot lines that nothing exists thematically to rival the groundbreaking visuals.
25368	4	a	The film's most crucial constituency -- the book's rabid fans -- are likely to feel well served by Murphy's adaptation, which hews pretty faithfully to Gilbert's story.
25369	3	a	A docudrama that may have an outcome we already know, but is a loud lesson about truth, justice and the Texas Way.
25370	4	a	Not really good, but the spectacle of Mazursky in drag almost makes up for it.
25371	4	a	With characters who are often as intricate and three-dimensional as an origami figure but a script that remains hopelessly paper-thin, Paper Towns is a disappointment coming on the heels of last summer's lovely weepie, The Fault in Our Stars.
25372	6	a	Director Mulligan can't find the right tone for Gavin Lambert's inside Hollywood tale about a girl rise to stardom before collapsing and so the story veers from a cautionary fable to Gothic melodrama to farce, but some of the acting is good.
25373	7	a	The down-for-anything cast, along with a handful of welcome cameos, can't prop up its weakest link: Seth MacFarlane.
25374	0	a	Delightful and lovely, a little gift of cinema.
25375	6	a	If only Roberts' warmth, coupled with Javier Bardem's scruffy sexiness as Felipe, were enough to compensate for the folded-map flatness of this production.
25376	0	a	The era of LGBT cinema has reached a zenith with this film.
25377	6	a	Every aspect of its production reeks of cynicism
25378	2	a	It Comes at Night is a film that is impossible to peg into one genre, and that is what makes it so effective... If you are willing to go with it, and allow the story to draw you in, Night should satisfy fans of the horror/suspense genre.
25379	3	a	L'auberge espagnole is so full and nourishing that even with a two-hour-plus running time, it's sad to see it end.
25380	1	a	Are we being played? Oh, yeah. Just because the time and place of a film takes place within personal experience doesn't mean it's not a historical epic.
25381	6	a	Star Wars fandom has been celebrated in pop culture for decades, but we're still waiting for a movie that captures it with any real level of truth.
25382	3	a	A sturdy, hero-worshipping picture that underplays the boasting which made Pre less sympathetic in last year's version by Hollywood Pictures.
25383	6	a	Sooner or later it becomes very hard to escape the sense that nothing actually happens in this film.
25384	1	a	The film proves there are auteurs even within the army-of-collaborators medium that is big-budget animation.
25385	3	a	What do you want, some meditation on the human condition?
25386	3	a	"The Hobbit"" is an impressive first chapter."
25387	6	a	The bad and the ugly are both covered, with a main character that has a scarred face and a deep desire for revenge. As for the good? That's more of a hit-or-miss proposition.
25388	4	a	While Garcia's principal preoccupation is with the fallout from adoption, it's the secondary storylines about women in the work place, and the stresses of marriage and pregnancy that are the film's strengths.
25389	9	a	Seyfried acts like she's spaced out on limoncello in a role even Kate Hudson would have turned down.
25390	3	a	The workmanlike script by Andrew Logan and Taylor Allen sticks to mostly verifiable facts, although it is damning in what it shows without comment.
25391	1	a	A profoundly entertaining collection of none-too-bright folks who think they're smarter than everyone else. And it's all set to the best soundtrack of the year.
25392	1	a	I sing the rage of Frances McDormand... When she is good, she is very, very good, but when she is mad she is better.
25393	5	a	Aimed squarely at the very young, this cute animation still feels far too rushed to spend any significant time on.
25394	1	a	First-time director Kelly Fremon Craig delivers a hilarious teen comedy with a truly original voice.
25395	3	a	Kaurismaki's affection for and faith in people shines through even in the darkest moments
25396	5	a	The movie isn't terrible, so it can't qualify as a hate-watch. It's just dull.
25397	3	a	Skyfall might stand as the lone example of a satisfying, standalone narrative blending with all those tried-and-true Bond tropes. Adele tune aside, Mendes makes nary a misstep.
25398	5	a	Pointless goof of a film, can't decide if it wants to be a superhero movie or a parody of one.
25399	1	a	This is another step in Mr. Murray's career and one that hopefully gets him the recognition he deserves.
25400	3	a	It pulls us in on the nudge-nudge-wink-wink strength of its premise, but what it does with that premise is more than Hollywood usually manages.
25401	1	a	Knocked Up is a knockout.
25402	4	a	...the filmmakers clearly intended the movie to be a carefree caper, and if one views it that way, it can pass an entertaining few hours.
25403	3	a	The movie is driven by slyly clever dialogue loaded with sneaky character insights.
25404	6	a	Might wring a few chuckles out of you, but certainly not much more than a few.
25405	4	a	The film's fatal flaw is Borte's refusal to give his satire the darker, uncomfortable edge it needs to give his lesson some impact.
25406	4	a	Owen Wilson single-handedly hauls this amiable, middle-of-the-road comedy out of sheer mediocrity.
25407	5	a	Couples Retreat turns out to be a sloppy, choppy mess.
25408	2	a	A roller coaster ride of unglamorous sophistication and artful escapes.
25409	5	a	Trying, monotonous, and not anywhere near as relevant or clever as it imagines itself to be, Vantage Point proves once again that while it's easy to rely on a gimmick, it's usually not the best idea to trust it.
25410	1	a	A bouncy mix of slapstick humor, shrewd character details and a poignant take on bringing the Christmas spirit to frequent fliers and children of divorce.
25411	2	a	intelligent character study of a mythologized athlete
25412	3	a	The film isn't particularly deep, but it's well written, well acted, and often laugh-out-loud funny.
25413	4	a	Mendes' skillfully struck detachment sabotages pathos.
25414	1	a	It's an inspired idea that allows for all kinds of wickedness and invention, and the filmmakers take it to the limit. But the movie's tone is lighthearted, kept buoyant by Elfman's songs and holiday cheer.
25415	0	a	Film of the year and a joy forever.
25416	4	a	Even if it feels a little too muddled and busy in its execution, there's enough here to inspire a more thoughtful and educated approach to telling a soldier's story.
25417	5	a	In George A. Romero's Land of the Dead, it's depressingly evident that the horror pioneer has been surpassed by his imitators.
25418	7	a	Not much for the thinking viewer -- which Snakes on a Plane tries its best to render obsolete -- to latch onto.
25419	3	a	The film was weird, but I mean that as a compliment.
25420	3	a	This bristling evocation of the last days of capitalism is compelling and unsettling in equal measure but ultimately memorable for being so very close to recent global happenings.
25421	10	a	This is a negative five. This is probably the worst movie of the year...it's so bad, halfway through the movie, I wondered if I was in a Jacob's Ladder scenario...
25422	5	a	Revolutionary Road is a moany, groany, phoney Oscars contender that's all boo-hoo-hooey. Mendes merely assumes we will share his characters' contempt for 'burbs life.
25423	4	a	The film is tailor-made for the vast audience that can't wait to watch Fox's Idol each week while still intellectually grasping what a glossy hunk of junk it is.
25424	3	a	A spirited and funny sequel to Wreck-It-Ralph . Lots of good gags involving the internet and one terrific sequence where Disney spoofs their own beloved princesses is worth the price of admission alone.
25425	4	a	Why do we have to have jokes about spitting and flatulence and other vulgarisms in a movie aimed at children?
25426	5	a	This sequel proves as unlikable as the original.
25427	1	a	There is the beloved and the lover. The first moves in shining beauty, and the second envies every ray of light that has the gift of kissing her. This is how it is in obsessions. It's how it is in the movies, too.
25428	9	a	This is nothing but a vanity project, relying on the conceit that Anne has been unfairly languishing in her husband's shadow. Eleanor Coppola must have made many sacrifices for her husband's art, but with Paris Can Wait the sacrifice is all ours.
25429	5	a	The film is so dull. It gives no sense of the complexity of the man, in terms of both his personal and professional lives.
25430	3	a	Smart and funny, but it plays a little cold.
25431	0	a	I was moved by the depth of feeling, by the skill of the actors and technicians, by their desire to see this project through no matter what.
25432	5	a	Cynicism or stupidity? It's hard to say which has the run of this idiotic satire in which Robin Williams plays a talk-show host who runs for president on a ticket of cleaning up politics.
25433	3	a	Christopher Robin sees what an adult vision of Milne's stories could be, and it simply says, 'No, thank you.'
25434	2	a	For those who get a gag like 'Looking for love in Alderaan places?' you don't have to worry if the movie is on your level or not.
25435	4	a	Another fine Aardman film with the movie screen brimming with inventiveness and genius, but a pedestrian script and some underused voice talent temper the success of the film. 
25436	10	a	"How do you say, ""I want a refund,"" in Italian?"
25437	5	a	Despite the presence of a talented and youthful ensemble cast, and some playful directorical touches involving split-screens and speeded-up footage, it remains only modestly entertaining.
25438	5	a	This film is not in the same league with its fine predecessor, Koyaanisqatsi.
25439	6	a	A random episode of American Idol offers more comedy and drama, not to mention more disturbing insights into contemporary popular culture, than American Dreamz.
25440	2	a	The punchy little flourishes that load this English gangster film with attitude are perfectly welcome, because there's no honest, substantial part of the movie they can hurt.
25441	6	a	I want to live in the alternate universe where Vanessa Redgrave's Claire is the lead of Letters to Juliet and the two vapid dorks who trail her on a journey of lost love can learn a lesson or two but never take the spotlight.
25442	4	a	Under no circumstances would I call Inherent Vice a bad film. It's too weird and fascinating and filled with too many delightful performances...
25443	5	a	...a hopelessly underwhelming comedy...
25444	2	a	The jaunty story has enough kinetic energy to keep young audiences engaged. And it remains truthful to the anarchic spirit of the game on which it is based.
25445	1	a	Outrageously, gut-bustingly hilarious.
25446	3	a	Leaves the audience smiling and giggling, all the while painting a convincing and touching portrait of the downtrodden in England.
25447	9	a	A loo book written by Pol Pot would have more laughs than this chillingly unfunny, cynically prefabricated non-comedy.
25448	0	a	In a film of grand gestures, some of the finest moments are very subtle.
25449	2	a	strength of this film lies with Hitchcock's incredible narrative ability and cinematic vision
25450	1	a	Depp is a raunchy wonder, especially in a time-capsule-worthy opening monologue.
25451	4	a	A pleasant slice of summer counter-programming that will delight adult moviegoers who complain that Hollywood doesn't make films for them anymore.
25452	2	a	A vitriolic film in which the director manages to create a very comforting intimacy. [Full review in Spanish]
25453	2	a	A pleasant date movie with several laughs and a couple of smiles. 
25454	2	a	Fassbender and Vikander give powerful performances and their on-screen chemistry holds the film together when the story wavers. 
25455	0	a	The perfect satirical horror. Brilliant observations about the genre, the media and the goth scene. Hilarious, and you actually care about the characters.
25456	3	a	Buff bods. Fantastic fish. Silly thriller twists, trolled along at a leisurely but increasingly suspenseful pace. Some funny lines and a shark attack or two. Did we mention there are buff bods?
25457	4	a	Etta's story will be better told in another film, surely.
25458	3	a	Nobody gives a more powerful locker room speech than Samuel L. Jackson, while decked out in spiffy suits and flashy neckties.
25459	9	a	Lazy and uninspired.
25460	2	a	Hitch skates by on appeal and indefatigability of effort.
25461	0	a	A haunting retelling of one of the enduring outlaw sagas in American culture.
25462	4	a	What The Rover lacks in story development, it makes up for with compelling tension, mystery, and acting finesse.
25463	3	a	Blending Jennifer Westfeldt's talky, observational style with the kind of irreverent humour that helped Bridesmaids bridge the gender divide, Friends With Kids explores love, marriage and child-rearing with gusto and wit.
25464	6	a	The major problem here is one of rooting interest. I hate to sound like a mogul, or a focus group ho, but at the center of this picture is a flat, inexpressive protagonist played by a flat, inexpressive actor.
25465	5	a	A detective story, a pharmaceutical miracle drug and winged creatures from some demonic dimension sprouting like weeds in the spring. Too much and too artificial.
25466	2	a	A star is born in Nicole Beharie in the role of an African-American woman wrongly arrested on a drug charge.
25467	7	a	Embarrassingly lopsided between the evocative talents of its starry cast and crew members and the sheer banality of what Jarmusch has actually invited them to participate in.
25468	2	a	Love, Simon is filled with love and recognition as it takes the high school rom-com template into new Hollywood territory, and it charms in the process.
25469	4	a	Good fun if you can put up with the pastel colours and plasticky textures, which show that in modern fantasy animation all that pixellates isn't Pixar.
25470	4	a	For what it is, Hitch gets the job done.
25471	4	a	A meandering drama about the lure of success and the ignominious aggression of defeat.
25472	3	a	It takes this never-ending confusion and hatred, puts a human face on it, evokes shame among all who are party to it and even promotes understanding.
25473	3	a	Let's hope this crew from the UK continues to stand up against the Starbucking of movies.
25474	3	a	An enjoyable, gorgeously photographed aquatic adventure whose stars are blissfully bodacious.
25475	4	a	'Despite all its flaws, this Phoenix rises to an acceptable entertainment level.'
25476	9	a	There is nothing wrong with Stallone's performance, or anyone's - all the big names in this movie were working hard to make sense out of a painfully empty, stupid script. 
25477	0	a	While it may seem dated today, the film showcases Sharon Stone, evil wife to Schwarzenegger. You may want to take notice of how precious air is after seeing it.
25478	3	a	'...a film that is both a great time in the present and a fine tribute to the past.' 
25479	2	a	"I imagine the four screenwriters divided it up: ""I'll make a list of places on the plane the snakes will be found, you do body parts they can bite, you do items on a plane that can be used as weapons, and you do things that can go wrong."
25480	6	a	Overlong, with interchangeable characters.
25481	3	a	The idea has likely been in Allen's head since forever, but it's arrived at the right moment.
25482	4	a	Interesting but never really compelling expansion of Lucas' student film.
25483	4	a	...as far as action flicks go, you could do worse.
25484	5	a	Well acted, but ultimately disappointing drama that's let down by a tedious script, sluggish direction, cloying sentimentality and an overwhelmingly sanctimonious central message.
25485	3	a	A movie made with the kind of vision and assurance you don't often get in a debut.
25486	2	a	A circus full of wacky and interesting characters.
25487	5	a	Sadly, while this gothic throwback is big on design it's shockingly short on actual scares. 
25488	2	a	Much like the original Death at a Funeral, it offers enough huge physically-driven laughs that it makes up for some of the lazier storytelling decisions. 
25489	1	a	This jovially sinister, middle-class morality tale-cum-horror show is predictable, implausible and fiendishly entertaining.
25490	5	a	Entertainment in dire need of its own self-assurance.
25491	5	a	This is a movie that all but licks your face and begs you to like it, and you'll find yourself wanting to oblige. But it's just too structured and seems overly concerned with conveying a sense of real time . . . 
25492	1	a	...a tender visual poem about unexpected friendship, traveler's angst and the disassociating allure of Tokyo.
25493	4	a	Amusingly off-the-wall sci-fi spoof
25494	2	a	The Veronica Mars movie is sure to delight the legions of fans of the show, while also acting as a satisfying mystery for those who are just meeting these characters for the first time.
25495	8	a	Wayne is an offbeat presence in River. His longish hair and loose gait - the latter usually indicating a relaxed sense of power - now imply a man out of his place, and a kind of restlessness.
25496	6	a	Think of it as an ancient-history lesson in the social evolution of long-extinct male dinosaurs.
25497	4	a	Nothing exceeds like excess in The Expendables.
25498	3	a	Memoirs of a Geisha is worthwhile on many levels, although it lacks the depth of feeling that would have elevated it from a good movie to a romance for the ages.
25499	6	a	"We AREN'T Marshall."" "
25500	4	a	Passable family pap.
25501	4	a	Despite the number in its title, this odd but sometimes entertaining documentary/docudrama hybrid looks at seven defendants who were accused of organizing the protests and orchestrating the resulting mayhem.
25502	4	a	The picture is high energy, feel-good, and sweet like bubblegum, and that's perfectly okay.
25503	4	a	Suffers by comparison with Hero's entrancing superreality.
25504	1	a	As a consumer, it is simply your responsibility to see it, just so that many more Love, Simons can be made.
25505	5	a	The film had eleven writers. I don't see why it needed any. It's unstructured, plotless, and even the truly funny moments are merely juvenile stabs in the dark.
25506	0	a	Brilliant, disturbing storytelling by Spielberg with standout performances.
25507	3	a	An unpretentious film that delivers more than the trailers might suggest.
25508	3	a	Jandreau proves a charismatic draw, even if some of the supporting non-actors struggle with naturalistic performances.
25509	5	a	"Yes, there is life on Mars in ""John Carter,"" and it's deadly dull."
25510	3	a	As confident and charismatic as its lead characters and every bit as fun to be around.
25511	2	a	A simple but likeable film that points out its characters' foibles while retaining an affection for their eccentricities.
25512	0	a	... no film lover can afford to miss this film... [Full review in Spanish]
25513	3	a	Banderas has some hair-raising scenes with Anaya as his in-house patient/muse.
25514	3	a	...an entertainingly shallow, undeniably mindless horror flick.
25515	8	a	When it's hard to hear the dialogue because the audience is laughing, it's clear that Valentine doesn't even succeed on its own limited terms.
25516	7	a	A more appropriate title would be The Great Whitewashing of the Rebellion.
25517	3	a	Consider it a fine sign of emotional discipline that the movie doesn't overplay Kelly and Ben's romantic possibilites.
25518	6	a	Androids may dream of electric sheep, but I, Robot's multi-million dollar machines are remnants of summer films gone by.
25519	5	a	As a grand big screen video game brought to exaggerated life, Doom is about as flexibly entertaining as a needlessly squeaky joystick...an over-extended misfire.
25520	5	a	[It] thinks a sex-obsessed version of a John Hughes comedy by its very nature is hilarious. It's not, but there are still some things to like here.
25521	5	a	The movie's problem is the division of loyalties between these two female leads, which fatally divides and muddles the dramatic focus.
25522	4	a	Campy sci-fi cult classic features violence, nudity.
25523	0	a	"Directed flawlessly by Clint Eastwood, ""Invictus"" is an uplifting story that will have you cheering in your seat."
25524	2	a	...it's hard to get past the idea of Taking Woodstock as a missed opportunity. It's fine around the edges, but it never convinces you that the central event was the cataclysmic cultural convergence some claim.
25525	4	a	...has its miscues and one can say that the twists and turns are on the borderline of predictability. Still, this Ring is worth wrapping around your little finger of twitchy suspense.
25526	2	a	Ben Stiller is simply fantastic, and this DeNiro kid could be big someday.
25527	4	a	Bora Bora was a beautiful location to film at and added that much needed taste of paradise to a rather bitter sweet subject of a troubled marriage.
25528	4	a	It's all passably entertaining, but there's precious little that will stay with you...
25529	5	a	Any story that's been passed down through several generations is likely to have been embellished along the way, but this adaptation of a Japanese folk tale takes things a little too far.
25530	4	a	... too long and slow, ... but it's beautifully photographed and performances are excellent ... 
25531	2	a	"This ""brand new bag"" of a biopic is coursing with energy thanks to an electric, rousing performance by Boseman that simply must be seen. "
25532	3	a	Has a distinctive and original voice that is rarely heard today.
25533	5	a	The Tourist is as beautiful as it is soulless.
25534	6	a	Brilliant when it's working and dull as dishwater when it's not.
25535	2	a	Although it can get a bit wearing on me to watch puppets, this is so well written and so tongue in cheek, that it was a pleasure. 
25536	3	a	Bening and Bell sell the material, creating an unlikely partnership that earns your compassion.
25537	4	a	Borte, directing his first film, does a smooth, confident job, so that even though the set-up isn't quite plausible you're happy to go along with it.
25538	1	a	A clever, goofy and a thoroughly entertaining ride. 
25539	0	a	The man-versus-the-natural world story is in Weir's wheelhouse, and Harris and Farrell get into a scene-stealing duel. Worth the trek.
25540	4	a	The film's wry wit and understanding of childhood anxieties will remind older viewers of the television series The Wonder Years which is no small compliment.
25541	2	a	If you're willing to have your patience tested, Twohy and his cast reward it.
25542	6	a	When you remove the popping, locking, crunking and breaking from the equation, what is left is ... melodrama, shorthanded plotting, and lame characterisation.
25543	5	a	Armored should crackle with nervous energy; however, the bland characters don't get much of interest to do and are virtually interchangeable.
25544	4	a	Coffee and Cigarettes will either entertain or madden you. Maybe both.
25545	2	a	The jokes rarely miss and the result is a refreshingly sardonic fairy tale.
25546	6	a	Timeline is one of the most frustrating movies I've seen this year.
25547	0	a	Eastwood's Bridges has the energy and spontaneity of a picture that was shot quickly. And that serves the material well, because it removes the solemnity that could stiffle a modern classic.
25548	10	a	Wong goes on auto-pilot to plot even more despicable ways of killing off the survivors, preferably minus their clothes.
25549	3	a	It's quite a movie -- atmospheric, obsessive, almost satanic.
25550	3	a	Funny on purpose and that, obviously, makes all the difference in the world.
25551	4	a	Appealing eye candy, but here's hoping that Yimou goes back to making movies that can rattle a nation down to its core.
25552	7	a	This film takes the most wrenching and universal dilemma of family life and turns it into a sitcom-y love letter to Sarah Jessica Parker. 
25553	2	a	... like its prickly heroine, the film doesn't always achieve its goals ...
25554	5	a	The story's accidental timeliness may generate some interest, but the film kills it pretty swiftly.
25555	5	a	As authentic as cheeseburger teriyaki.
25556	6	a	The scenery is spectacular and the food porn is fabulous, but what should be insouciant feels insipid in this stretched-out travelogue, mostly due to underwritten characters and awkward performances.
25557	2	a	"Dating is difficult. Relationships can be tough. ""Hitch"" wants to be the Band-Aid that heals the wound."
25558	7	a	...isn't so much a bad movie as an unfinished movie
25559	3	a	Casey Affleck's performance as the awkward, awed, angry man-child carries this film, but never hogs it. It's probably too subtle and generous to get Oscar's attention, but at least the Golden Globes caught on.
25560	4	a	An agreeable period romp, missing the spark of the high-end Austen adaptations but firmly in command of its own romantic devices.
25561	4	a	"With La Debra finally in the picture, all I can say is, ""give us more Messing."" Our first date might have been a dud but I'm willing to go out again."
25562	5	a	It's the movie equivalent of a row of trophies, all with blank plaques, or a bust of some anonymous Ozymandias - a vision of greatness with all the memorable details sanded off.
25563	4	a	For all its feeling of a throwaway penny dreadful, Crimson Peak looks gorgeous ... Still, it's the film's smaller moments that set the mind racing.
25564	4	a	An entertaining but hollow venture, all bark but no bite.
25565	2	a	Free from the encumbrances of history and of Ludlum's cloddish prose, The Bourne Identity, like its hero, triumphs through sheer unreflective professionalism.
25566	3	a	The deadpan nature of the film's humor is refreshing, and the cast seems to be having a blast.
25567	0	a	Selma is an almost impassable minefield of opportunities to make a bad film. Director Ava DuVernay danced through like Fred Astair.
25568	0	a	Because Schindler's List is a movie of such power, scope and intelligence, it will eventually take its place alongside masterpieces like Battleship Potemkin, Grand Illusion and The Great Dictator.
25569	9	a	A fatuous and depressing parade of nothingness...
25570	4	a	Inventive visuals and lively voice cast lift this finely animated film above the fray. So it's a shame that the story feels both random and predictable.
25571	2	a	Performance remarquable au coeur d'un film moyen.
25572	5	a	Despite solid backup from the ever-formidable Gene Hackman and others, this routine hiatus schedule-filler proves to be a shaky platform from which to launch the likable Romano's candidacy as a big-screen leading man.
25573	5	a	I haven't seen so many cold stares in one movie since March of the Penguins.
25574	3	a	an odd concoction of black comedy, crime-movie cliches, and social satire.
25575	1	a	Gory and shocking.
25576	2	a	The series has found new traction in the heist format -- resulting in a fun and immensely entertaining ride.
25577	9	a	"As I was an infantry soldier in Afghanistan, the situational comedy related to Fey being in danger, or experiencing some mild hardship was just too slight. I kept wanting to say to the film, ""Hell, that's nothing..."
25578	4	a	Just charming enough to keep it from becoming a dud... It's Robinson's delicate touch that keeps us watching.
25579	1	a	Logan Lucky is sensational, the fact it stole my heart away with seemingly so little effort whatsoever the greatest heist of them all.
25580	8	a	Brandy, the nerdish character who wants to lose her virginity, is unlikable, annoying, grating and so unpleasant, there's no reason to care whether she will or won't.
25581	3	a	Even those unfamiliar with the good ship Bebop will enjoy the high-intensity action and witty dialogue.
25582	5	a	Do you always talk in bumper sticker? Julia Roberts asks Richard Jenkins as they banter back and forth at an ashram in India. Yes, he does. And so does Eat Pray Love. 
25583	5	a	I, Frankenstein looks suspiciously like it was conceived more as a ready-made franchise property than as a strong individual story. 
25584	0	a	A classic gets even better.
25585	1	a	Don Cheadle practically bounces off the screen with a high energy, hilarious, and heartrending performance where every unexpected word keeps his audience--and that includes us--spellbound.
25586	6	a	While there's a certain poetic symmetry to a lethargic film about lethargy, it doesn't make for a terribly edifying viewing experience.
25587	1	a	This movie was not a pleasant experience, but it was exhilarating in the sense that I was able to observe filmmakers working at the edge of their abilities and inspirations.
25588	3	a	With a large dose of Sherlock and a sprinkling of The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-Time, Benedict Cumberbatch is just brilliant in the role of Alan Turing.
25589	5	a	It snows one day in Max Payne, rains like crazy the next, and then it snows again. But any way you slice it, the movie's all wet.
25590	4	a	It's all good fun.
25591	9	a	Rest assured that nothing of significance will disturb said infant, neither feelings nor images nor ideas. No danger here; just a faint, faraway tickle of boredom.
25592	1	a	What Campion does is seek visual beauty to match Keats' verbal beauty. There is a shot here of Fanny in a meadow of blue flowers that is so enthralling it beggars description.
25593	6	a	Leave it to Hollywood to make a movie called Radio that would play better on TV.
25594	8	a	"A sleazy and pointless film about sleazy and pointless people, ""Killer Joe"" reminds us that what Quentin Tarantino does isn't easy."
25595	2	a	A good story with one of two parts that malfunction - the wise-guy comedy is going to make the movie more commercial, but in this case, it hurts the story.
25596	6	a	Hotel for Dogs gives the mutts plenty of personality, but every so often, the story has to fling back into the lives of the kids. That's when I'd lose interest.
25597	9	a	It also feels ridiculously out of touch.
25598	8	a	A disaster area.
25599	5	a	Alas, this is neither edgy nor funny enough.
25600	5	a	No legitimate characters or performances here, just impersonations of the easy target clods that grace the stage of 'American Idol' and White House press conferences.
25601	4	a	Funny, dated sexist comedy
25602	6	a	The Dressmaker is a visual feast -- contrasting a dreary rural Australian town with outrageous couture costumes -- but it's let down by an inflated running time and confused tone.
25603	6	a	Get on Up is full of standard-issue biopic moments, but they're played slightly out of order, with a fractured chronology that's more confusing than illuminating.
25604	4	a	Streamlines a fascinating true story into functional prestige filmmaking, but it's still plenty engaging, thanks largely to its lead.
25605	6	a	"The first feature film from ""Funny or Die..."" director Jordan Vogt-Roberts, ""The Kings of Summer"" isn't very funny and dies slowly but surely as a coming-of-age film that bludgeons the viewer with its own quirkiness."
25606	1	a	Liam Neeson was the only man Jordan ever wanted to play this role, and for good reason.
25607	10	a	...vulgar, disgusting, tasteless drivel.
25608	4	a	A depressing, trite and mawkishly Hollywood story about the death of a creepy old man and its effect on his spoiled grown-up daughters.
25609	8	a	Jonah Hex lost its way long before it hit the screen, laboring mightily to deliver a threadbare collection of postmortem detritus.
25610	2	a	This is an unconventional boxing story that sells out a bit by playing with history, but it gives us enough gritty realism from the cast and camera work to make Bleed For This a solid boxing flick.
25611	3	a	Gabriel Byrne is the fisherman who won't interrupt his trip; Laura Lin ney is the wife who finds his actions hard and, finally, horrifying to comprehend. And for the most part it works.
25612	2	a	If you enjoy a good mystery that's as grimy as a stomped on cigarette on the pavement then this film will have you hooked. Fans of the books should be pleased.
25613	1	a	A masterful human comedy and a sincere drama, as imaginative as it is unpredictable.
25614	4	a	It's the increasingly complicated dance setpieces that most fans will be here for - and they certainly don't disappoint ...
25615	6	a	An incredibly dull low-key thriller barely driven by its two A-list leads.
25616	6	a	There's a nice little gem of a movie hidden within Roll Bounce, and a tired, needlessly schmaltzy one.
25617	3	a	...a fairly winning animated endeavor.
25618	0	a	The most perfect film of the year.
25619	3	a	"While ""Hitchcock"" is a fascinating look behind the scenes at the making of one of the greatest suspense films ever made, there's not really much insight to be found about Hitchcock himself."
25620	2	a	Despite its challenging central character, The Libertine offers a curiously entertaining look at a true original, as well as a glance at a fascinating age in English history as a society goes bonkers after a time of repression.
25621	9	a	Is it a thoroughly offensive attempt to disguise a reactionary view of African-Americans as manipulative, self-serving, serial complainers as 'comedy'? Definitely.
25622	0	a	Uplifting, heart-warming, hilarious... not necessarily words you'd expect to apply to a black and white silent French film. But The Artist is no ordinary movie.
25623	4	a	Nice look at the early life of the Beatles.
25624	3	a	The comic elements are handled with a delicacy so that they do not overwhelm the dramatic underpinnings.
25625	6	a	There's something to be said for restraint, even when dealing with impulsive characters in a carefree scenario.
25626	3	a	Definitely tilts toward the white guy POV, but still a smart, quotable and well-acted drama that turns stereotypes on their ears.
25627	0	a	Lost in Translation is a witty laugh out-loud tale of friendship. Coppola breaks through and stands firmly at the edge of her future.
25628	6	a	It may not go yard, but it doesn't strike out either.
25629	6	a	Despite good intentions, the movie never lives up to the breathless excitement the real-life story promises.
25630	0	a	It's outlandish fun, dramatic and exciting, too - pure entertainment with a capital E.
25631	5	a	Heavy-handed erotic political drama.
25632	1	a	The movie is paced with precision. Although we spend plenty of time getting to know the characters, there's never a dull moment, and the transitions from one scene to the next are particularly smart.
25633	5	a	This sluggish would-be adventure is further burdened with a turgid, overly complicated plot.
25634	3	a	It's hard not to wish that maybe there was a little less of Muhammad Ali promoting himself and a little more of the concert.
25635	4	a	a disposable family adventure it more than fits the bill
25636	4	a	Very visual but I couldn't tell you what happened if I had to.
25637	7	a	As I, Robot details how Smith must fight for his survival against an army of white men whom he alone knows are evil, the film might have been called 'I, Hollywood'.
25638	4	a	Like eager kids on their first date, this romantic comedy stumbles and fumbles at times but its heart is definitely in the right place. Sometimes that's just enough.
25639	5	a	There's a potentially innovative teen comedy in here somewhere, but it's surrounded by one that's much duller.
25640	3	a	A vibrant, funny, moving, highly entertaining and richly rewarding movie experience. Don Cheadle soars into the highest rank of film actors with this role. Ejiofor and Henson are magnificent.
25641	1	a	The film is teeming with an overwhelming amount of integrity, heart, soul, and some of the best written characters to invade genre fiction in quite some time.
25642	4	a	It's a good script, packed with knowing zingers about the game of love.
25643	4	a	a chaotic yet amusing tale of animated avians battling plundering pigs
25644	1	a	The tension of being around a psycho-killer like Anton keeps you on the edge of your seat, with the much-needed relief coming in the brand of humor that only the Coen brothers can deliver.
25645	5	a	Dazzling visuals, gob smacking editing, flamboyant sets and deliciously over the top characters...I fail to see what the attraction is with this film
25646	9	a	A run of the mill cop movie that's stylish but ultimately boring.
25647	4	a	Amol Gupte is perfectly cast, leaving an impact with a superb, killer performance.
25648	2	a	"The movie boasts a fantastic performance by Vera Farmiga and an exceedingly unhappy storyline. It's a movie you ""appreciate"" more than you ""enjoy."
25649	1	a	As Nim's story turns from scientifically compelling to tragic, Marsh is able to craft a drama that appeals even to those who aren't exactly card-carrying members of PETA.
25650	3	a	Macy and Allen prove once again why they are deserving of their respective places on the acting pantheon.
25651	4	a	Neither Rango the mash-up movie nor Rango the lizard is particularly lovable. But there's no denying the intrigue in its combination of the good, the bad, and the ugly.
25652	9	a	The most unintentionally hilarious film so far this year.
25653	1	a	Love, Simon is filled with humor-in its characters, dialogue, and situations-but it doesn't sacrifice emotional depth. The two work in tandem.
25654	3	a	Despite controversies swirling around the movie, one cannot deny that Gibson has made a stunning film, beautifully photographed in contrasting dark and golden hues by Caleb Deschanel.
25655	3	a	Krasinski stitches these raw blasts of the subconscious with interludes that exude a pleasing, Woody Allen-esque tone, all fall colors and potent theorizing over white wine
25656	6	a	John Malkovich and Josh Brolin are too good for the sloppy, overripe Jonah Hex. 
25657	3	a	It's a big, extended live-action pop-up book that adults will be able to smile with alongside their own kids.
25658	3	a	This kind of film should be like a porno: Don't even bother trying to come up with a plot, just cut to the money shot.
25659	3	a	The film, anchored by an entrancing performance by Amy Adams and a strong ensemble cast, is cleverly written. The situations are funny, and the story feels effortlessly entertaining.
25660	6	a	As generic an action film as you can make.
25661	4	a	Some good characters and some funny scenes, and maybe some insights, but that doesn't add up to as much as it might have.
25662	3	a	Ringing true fairly consistently and lingering afterwards even in its lightness, the film doesn't have to try to please. It just does.
25663	3	a	A total delight, thanks to its proven formula of clever pop arrangements, dry humor and superb casting.
25664	4	a	Pulsing with incredulity and dread, it's less a fully developed argument than the seed of one.
25665	4	a	Against the Ropes may not deliver a knock-out, but it does land some pretty good blows.
25666	1	a	On the surface, this Italian dramedy about a troubled cardinal reluctant to accept his election to the papacy is a likable, understated farce. Look closer and you'll see that it has serious issues on its mind.
25667	6	a	You can often gauge how desperate a comedy is by the number of attacking animals it features.
25668	9	a	The basics of the story remain unchanged, but it's the wanna-be-blockbuster additions that rankle, be it the incoherent direction of first-time feature director Carl Rinsch or the copious CGI beasties who look like rejected Lord of the Rings villains.
25669	2	a	Go for the spectacle, go for the fun, just don't expect anything as significant as the impact made by Burroughs' books.
25670	5	a	The acting is atrocious and more obvious than you see in many high school or college productions. The jokes are stale. The storyline is so predictable, I'll bet nearly everyone in the theater will guess what happens next.
25671	0	a	Kids will love it and want to see it again and again. Adults . . . probably will too.
25672	4	a	Though not a bad film, all too often it feels like a slickly made studio offering with nary the juice and verve of the zombie master's prior, lower budget, ventures.
25673	6	a	Everybody's least favorite hive workers get an anthropomorphic makeover, courtesy of Jerry Seinfeld, in this animated flick that's got some stinging wit but a story that's strictly for the birds.
25674	5	a	I appreciated the film quality and the acting but the story meandered in superficial courtship for too long without delivering actual connection. It was all foreplay and no action. Perhaps the sequel will make this film more appealing to me in the future.
25675	5	a	Marshall remarkably has established a challenging tone making the audience aware of the world the characters live in beneath the gloss.
25676	5	a	The good news is that Letters to Juliet is only the third-worst romantic comedy set in Europe released this year.
25677	2	a	A close-to-brilliant comedy-Western ... until the end.
25678	4	a	Shadow feels like a missed opportunity.
25679	4	a	No audience will enjoy itself more at a film, as long as they remember that this film is raunchy and does not stop at any boundary of good taste.
25680	0	a	A powder keg of a movie, exploding with emotional honesty and truth and the exuberant passion of raw young talent.
25681	6	a	This is a case of good actors given earthy characters but...they are really caricatures and not much more.
25682	2	a	Flawed but engaging, with an excellent performance by Kevin Costner. 
25683	6	a	Frothy ensemble comedy/romance flick.
25684	6	a	The film's seduction is all too obvious to ravish anyone.
25685	7	a	Long before the end of the film, you'll wish you'd followed the example of the baby moose that, early into the proceedings, chewed through its rope and wandered off.
25686	3	a	Bening doesn't dodge the lens which highlights her own ageing face and gives a superbly brave performance.
25687	3	a	A powerful, complex drama and a long-overdue tribute to a true hero and visionary. 
25688	3	a	A poignant, moving film of hope and tragedy.
25689	5	a	A safely predictable, predictably safe movie about characters who never risk or question anything, and filmmakers who think poop jokes are the height of wit.
25690	4	a	"Though ""Get On Up"" never congeals into a satisfactory whole, its fragmentary portrait of the singer at the height of his fame - intercut with his troubled single-parent childhood - effectively shows his invasive power in popular culture. "
25691	3	a	How hard can life be? This hard. If you have tears, prepare to shed them now.
25692	3	a	A genial, lightweight entertainment.
25693	5	a	Parker's anti-Carrie Bradshaw messiness is coupled to a horse-like grin that is both sentimental and overcooked. I don't know how she gets away with it.
25694	6	a	[A] routine scare production from Hammer.
25695	8	a	An astounding work of mythological storytelling.
25696	4	a	The movie is all about the set-up - something that becomes a crutch disguised as a narrative tic as the story unfolds. 
25697	4	a	... The quintessence of the mainstream summer sequel: loud, slick, preposterous and thoroughly disposable, where any potentially damaging sugar of invention is quickly, safely flushed out of its engine so the machinery of manipulation and the Law of Dimin
25698	5	a	You couldn't nail a particular kind of modern French film better if you tried: explicit sex, bad behavior, and shrieking pretention all in one lumpy shock-the-bourgeoisie package.
25699	5	a	This is a story that had potential, but Michod's unwillingness to develop any of it only leads it down the path to becoming another small, forgotten film that no one's likely to take any notice of.
25700	5	a	Ultimately, despite a handful of fairly amusing moments, this is a disappointing comedy, suffering from a surfeit of characters. Still, at least it's mercifully shorter than the first movie.
25701	0	a	Wildly inventive, exceptionally cast and undeniably controversial, there's an endless list of subtexts and viewpoints which will fuel student pub debates for years.
25702	3	a	There's an insecurity to Ralph, accentuated by the fact Vanellope doesn't need Ralph's help anymore. The way they visualize that with a massive metaphor is both brilliant and heartbreaking.
25703	2	a	There's no power fantasies here, no ego trips or fairy tale stories about a loser made good. In this case, the persona serves the story, not the other way around.
25704	0	a	[VIDEO ESSAY] Here lies the defective foundation of the American Dream as viewed from an implicitly American viewpoint - Bert Lancaster's company produced the film. 
25705	6	a	Director Jay Roach gives the film no visual distinction whatsoever but packs on the jokes with tireless bustle.
25706	3	a	This engrossing doc plunges you into the chaos of this ambitious project, with behind-the-scenes glimpses of these great artists.
25707	2	a	By tying it back to characters that don't seem popped from any too-familiar mold, the film allows its sense of regret, its alarm at time passing, to feel earned.
25708	6	a	The movie builds atmosphere at the expense of action, buildup at the expense of payoff.
25709	1	a	With the events of Ferguson so fresh in our memories, Selma is uncomfortable yet necessary viewing.
25710	9	a	Earnestly heartfelt all the way, this movie goes bonkers right out of the gate and doesn't let up until the final shot of Damon having a vision of his own future, so don't worry if you find yourself giggling.
25711	6	a	Miami Vice is about as hip as a marathon session of Uno.
25712	5	a	Having seen both Anthony Hopkins and Brian Cox as Lecter, poor Ulliel is on a hiding to nothing.
25713	9	a	The story bungles ahead pointlessly, mixing melodrama and self-help book affirmations.
25714	6	a	"Christopher Robin"" misses the point. In trying to rescue the hero from his seriousness, the busy film hasn't the faintest idea how to play."
25715	3	a	The story's rambling, meandering style is just right for the melancholy subject being explored, and all the acting is excellent.
25716	2	a	On the surface, Witchboard looks like a campy, cheesy horror film that most would shrug off pretty quickly, but it's those qualities that make it more enjoyable than most of the same ilk.
25717	6	a	Zhang Yimou's film is a bit of a hodgepodge, a work that sets up as epic in scale, but then pitches its tale on a far smaller level.
25718	3	a	Boasting a clever title, this is an inspired piece of lunacy about sociology versus biology, with terrific performances from Ben Stiller and his two sets of parents.
25719	6	a	The movie plays like the kind of line a rich older guy would lay on a teenage model, suppressing his own intelligence and irony in order to spread out before her the wonderful world he would like to give her as a gift.
25720	4	a	This is a date movie that doesn't offer the sophistication it thinks it does, but is as enjoyable and good-natured as the genre requires.
25721	9	a	Awful from start to finish.
25722	4	a	With McConaughey in an entirely irony-free zone and Bale reduced mainly to batting his sensitive eyelids, there's not enough intelligence, wit or innovation on the screen to attract and sustain an older crowd.
25723	4	a	he long stretches between stations make The Way Back an arduous road.
25724	6	a	Although De Palma doesn't always stick rigorously to each separate viewpoint, there's an undeniable finesse in the way he parcels out the exposition in increments...
25725	0	a	An outstanding movie for families with older kids.
25726	0	a	The film still makes the viewer swoon, its heady mood of love and longing generated by the briefest of glances and gestures. 
25727	3	a	The film's charm, quickness and design carry the day.
25728	6	a	The disjointed mess flows as naturally as Jolie's hideous yellow 'do.
25729	4	a	"Dragon Blade"" remains familiar, but it's also passionate and competently assembled, only really losing step when it lingers on the obvious instead of celebrating the unexpected."
25730	3	a	See it, enjoy it, and remind yourself why having fun is never a crime.
25731	4	a	Subtle and sensitive, creating a fascinating, if far-fetched facade.
25732	0	a	"If there were any doubts left as to Ms. Coppola's abilities [as a filmmaker]... ""Lost in Translation"" should smash down the snickering walls of her doubters once and for all."
25733	3	a	A vicious take-off on reality TV that turns a high-school milieu dominated by cliques and childish relationships into a war zone.
25734	0	a	This is by far one of the most intriguing documentaries I have ever seen.
25735	4	a	As far as cautionary tales go, The Lazarus Effect is pretty good stuff overall and effectively rises above its mild approach to deliver a thoughtful and intense horror experience that I had a lot of fun with despite all its flaws.
25736	4	a	Equal parts amusing and tedious - but not in any sense the disaster some have called it.
25737	3	a	Fantastic fun.
25738	2	a	It's a deeply felt film that slips out of Beresford's grasp now and again, but remains engrossing and elegant to its final moves.
25739	4	a	The more dark it becomes, the more 'The Hobbit' becomes compelling as a story, and finds a fitting tone.
25740	4	a	If you are planning to shoot a visual poem, there is no one better to have on hand than cinematographer Christopher Doyle. Doyle knows how to find seduction and romance anywhere.
25741	1	a	What makes the movie so winning are its endearing and relatable characters who spout believable dialogue and amusing banter, steeped in clever pop-culture references and sharp observations of human nature.
25742	2	a	It's unusual for a quiet, mature movie to open as the summer blockbuster season gets under way. But Paris Can Wait might be a welcome respite for older moviegoers -- and even discerning younger ones.
25743	4	a	Although Rio Bravo rather ambles along, it still has enough good points to make it a genial viewing experience.
25744	4	a	It does some of what it sets out to accomplish and most viewers will depart the theater with at least the beginnings of a warm, fuzzy feeling. These days, it's hard to ask for much more.
25745	6	a	The class B movie cult that refuses to die. [Full Review in Spanish] 
25746	3	a	Despite the artifice, or perhaps partly because of it, the film manages to be enjoyable.
25747	4	a	All of these films are okay, if you order your movies up with extra CHEESE.
25748	10	a	Takes one of mankind's key tales of grace and redemption and reduces it to horror.
25749	6	a	Like those overreaching sophomore term papers we can all laugh at now, this disappointing film may free the Hughes brothers to move on to fresher, more inspired work.
25750	0	a	Scorsese's film is a work of passion and faith, and admirable for the way it fearlessly explores its themes, disregarding canonical dogma in search of human truth.

25752	5	a	Pop quiz: What's worse than a disaster flick? Answer: A remake of a disaster flick.
25753	9	a	The level of trouble you're in when you're down to stealing from Uwe Boll flies right off the scale.
25754	6	a	Who knew that a reunion of Metroland stars Bale and Watson could yield something so downright nutty?
25755	2	a	It's not as successful a satire, comedy, or melodrama [as Lourdes]. In fact, it's a bit of a tonal mishmash. Still, We Have a Pope is a nice allegory about the dangers of olde-timey traditions. 
25756	3	a	A genuinely human redemption story wrapped in a dark, violent thriller.
25757	4	a	[MacFarlane] is so naturally gifted at delivering glib laughs that he doesn't really need to try, and A Million Ways To Die In The West would benefit from a lot more effort and a little less of MacFarlane's cavalier confidence.
25758	4	a	Thanks to Fey, as well as the other actors, it has grit. But it doesn't have teeth.
25759	3	a	There are very few action stars who can convincingly mansplain their way through a scene where mystic rune stones that control the elements are used to stop and start a thunderstorm, and Diesel is on that very short list.
25760	3	a	There are flashes of wildly entertaining humour but for the most part the film keeps its chuckles on the gentler side of funny.
25761	5	a	A few bits of great physical comedy remain, as when Rogen and Efron get locked in a garage. But they could have been taken from - or slipped into - any movie. They have nothing to do with their characters, or the plot.
25762	3	a	A fascinating film about exploitation as it applies to blacks and the entertainment industry.
25763	4	a	The film is full of moments of stifled hilarity...
25764	9	a	Maybe somebody decided the movie was already so convoluted and leaden that throwing in a few swooping, screeching valkyries could only help. They do not.
25765	4	a	This love letter to Valentino from director Matt Tyrnauer seems intended for the already smitten.
25766	8	a	A bizarre cut that finds Kelly and Beau riding a freight train just adds to the sensation that we're witnessing a film career off its rails.
25767	3	a	[an] eye-popping comic book of a movie
25768	9	a	Something has gone really, really wrong here.
25769	3	a	Overwrought to contemporary eyes, perhaps, but still troubling and, in its own way, powerful.
25770	5	a	Obvious, broad and burdened by leaden lines of dialogue that are dropped here and there like demented coconuts.
25771	3	a	Aiming to instruct and entertain, and often struggling to reconcile these goals, Amistad lacks the subtlety of tone and simplicity of form that made Schindler's List one of Spielberg's very best; here, however, every idea and image are too explicit.
25772	5	a	It's not the age of the actors that makes The Expendables expendable. It's the stale storytelling.
25773	9	a	Dreadful fantasy thriller that's let down by a derivative, badly written script, dodgy special effects, poor pacing, dismal dialogue and a dull central performance from Eckhart.
25774	6	a	A movie that serves up what its debauched subject would never have countenanced -- sanitized smut with a moral attached.
25775	6	a	This is certainly a great idea for a film, it just needs better execution, less stalling for and wasting of time, and a better means of showing the difficult period that Cardinal Melville is going through.
25776	4	a	Artily composed, highly subjective and light on plot - it's still a long way from the mainstream, but well-built suspense and an instinctive feel for teen and skate life keep things ticking over until the paranoia peters out.
25777	0	a	Weird, funny, would-be cult film, filled with its strange spaces and surreal dream logic.
25778	5	a	For a supposedly strong character, Kate infuriatingly allows herself to be victimized by everyone around her, even her kids, who withhold affection when they feel she's gone too often because of work.
25779	3	a	A tale of family, history and the middle aged man trying to make sense of it all.
25780	7	a	Perhaps the biggest sin in The Darkest Minds is the film's refusal to fully explore the world it creates.
25781	9	a	Consider this one stillborn, and put your faith in better horror offerings to come. The real devil is ever having to view this movie.
25782	2	a	"Bow Wow is up to the challenge. ""Roll Bounce"" is a fun flash back film that showcases black people in a positive light, and features a thumping soundtrack to boot."
25783	3	a	Still, beneath the plethora of in-joke Easter eggs and already dated social media gags lies a film on a Pixar-like mission to make parents blub into their popcorn.
25784	4	a	The first film was revolutionary. The second is evolutionary. And therein lies the difference, and the line between great and good.
25785	5	a	One half is a characteristic sex farce, the other a surprisingly genuine and amiable romance.
25786	2	a	When Don Cheadle stands front and centre, he does special things onscreen, and he makes Talk to Me most worthwhile, despite Kasi Lemmons' unsteady directorial hand.
25787	4	a	stinks
25788	6	a	...fussily enigmatic.
25789	2	a	The film works best of all as a vehicle for Richard Gere, who has simply never looked better or held the screen more securely.
25790	5	a	After a few initial pratfalls, the humor gives way to a saccharine pathos as Dickie is supposed to be growing up emotionally and becoming mutually attached to the family. Unbelievable conversations and stupid dance numbers replace the humor.
25791	4	a	Most definitely not a movie for young children
25792	6	a	Despite some sharp dialogue, this is a nasty, derivative film, sort of a cross between Tarantino's Reservoir Dogs and Altman's The Player.
25793	9	a	The major downfall of the Elm Street series. Turned Freddy into a joke. A bad joke, at that.
25794	5	a	It's true that Lopez can't cure what ails Ayers--but it sure seems like Grant and Wright have the answer for what ails us.
25795	1	a	It's a near-perfect mix of juvenility and intelligence, and of coarseness and sweetness.
25796	7	a	Lacking anything resembling subtext and anything resembling genuine suspense, The Beginning is little more than just another hackneyed rehash of increasingly diminishing returns.
25797	5	a	rather crude, occasionally risible, if never actively dislikeable melodrama.
25798	5	a	A movie strictly for the already-converted fans of Marlon Wayans' brand of decidedly off-color, so-stupid-it's-funny big-screen goofballery.
25799	4	a	Basic Instinct transfers Mr. Verhoeven's flair for action-oriented material to the realm of Hitchcockian intrigue, and the results are viscerally effective even when they don't make sense.
25800	7	a	So, what's it all about? Is it still for the moment we live?
25801	3	a	Delightful and clever.
25802	10	a	Avoid at all costs.
25803	10	a	Doom is irritating enough to make you blow off some steam by spending a couple hours gunning down demons.
25804	6	a	With approximately six more hours to go, it's tough not to shudder at the sheer lengths director Peter Jackson is about to go to stretch this story into paper-thin taffy.
25805	4	a	Despite a few pokes at the folks from Pixar, nobody will lose any sleep over it. Obviously, these R-rated cinematic tricks from Rogen, et al. are not for kids.
25806	9	a	One of the reasons we don't miss Demi.
25807	3	a	Sex is the star here, and she shines.
25808	9	a	If ever there was a movie that used the R rating for all it's worth to do things that could not be done on television, it's this one.
25809	4	a	It rides on the charm of its actors, particularly Amy Adams as the hapless, homicidally upbeat princess and James Marsden as her would-be prince charming.
25810	4	a	Never reaches the bar it sets for itself.
25811	3	a	This isn't so much a horror film about monsters as it is a psychological thriller about isolation, the choices made for survival, and the struggle to remain rational against an unseen, enigmatic force.
25812	3	a	Thanks to Kevin James' earnest portrayal of an earnest guy, I was won over by the film's goofy charms.
25813	3	a	Orange County is a very smart movie masquerading as a very dumb one.
25814	1	a	...in many ways remarkable, one of the best conventional Hollywood movies to ever engage the seemingly intractable American problem of racial injustice.
25815	0	a	Javier Bardem makes for a terrifying villain. He looks physically corrupt but seems every bit as relentless as the Terminator. He's also believably, psychotically human.
25816	3	a	It's easy to see why this is a classic. It's got a great story, pacing that keeps you on your toes, decent performances, and a style that's timeless.
25817	5	a	An insane fantasy for rich people.
25818	4	a	One senses the filmmakers were going for something more profound and transformative than what ended up on screen.
25819	4	a	It may be seriously flawed, but American Dreamz is still amusing and pleasantly subversive.
25820	4	a	While Yates' story retains flecks of perceptiveness, this is as disappointing as the characters' compromises.
25821	5	a	Instead of focusing mostly on the budding relationship between the two leads, the movie throws in useless subplots and needless distractions when all we really want is to see Grant and Bullock fall in love.
25822	3	a	Not only is it hysterically funny, but it's refreshing to see a movie about adults that's not dumbed down for kids.
25823	0	a	Graceful, heartfelt and infused with a generous spirit, this is a rare and lovely drama.
25824	1	a	The film...asks the question: what if the universe as we live it, not just as we theorize it, really isn't as we imagine it? In making the mundane as bottomless as the cosmic, Donnie Darko has the guts to remain a riddle itself.
25825	3	a	A cautionary tale of what unchecked ambition and lust can do to a person, a family, a nation.
25826	10	a	Watch as millions of dollars are hurled at us in the form of bad special effects and an impenetrable labyrinth of a story that I cannot imagine a single soul caring about.
25827	2	a	A fascinating portrait of the marriage and creative partnership of Alfred Hitchcock and his talented wife Alma Reville. 
25828	2	a	A slow, complex tale about how people live together, and about the rituals and relationships that constitute community.
25829	1	a	"Not a mawkish dying-dog tearjerker, ""My Dog Skip"" carries a touch of Mark Twain, with quasi-dangerous tall tales and awareness of a gap between childhood and boyhood. Plus, as it's said of ""The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn,"" there's cussin' in it."
25830	5	a	Miami Vice, although stunning to look at, is ultimately a joyless viewing experience.
25831	10	a	Identity Thief is a cinematic shart - a huge mess that's no fun to clean up.
25832	9	a	A movie that runs out of people to kill very quickly and seems in a huge hurry to be over.
25833	4	a	...for those looking for something slick and supernatural and just a bit goofy, it's an enjoyable treat with a few tricks up its sleeve.
25834	4	a	It is very derivative -- but it has been made with diabolical amounts of energy.
25835	0	a	The most auspicious debut film ever for a director.
25836	6	a	Surreal but disappointingly drab, it's still not the best Almodovar in years.
25837	7	a	The comedy and drama simply don't jive and the end result is sheer and utter idiocy.
25838	1	a	This is a brilliant, personal film.
25839	2	a	Hollywood at its hokum best.
25840	4	a	Despite a potpourri of minor delights, the film ends up a disappointment.
25841	1	a	You realize that the movie is not just a superior model of teen comedy; it may, in fact, be the equal of those beloved Eighties touchstones. 
25842	9	a	Shake this one back into the film can and let it rot there.
25843	3	a	May be one of the most impressive portraits of an artist ever committed to film, if mostly because it also transcends its subject as a masterful examination of medieval Russia.
25844	0	a	Though these events occurred half a century ago, their power and relevance are undiminished.
25845	4	a	Bright Star is an admirable film made by a superb craftsman, but for me, Campion fails to deliver the big emotional punch she hopes to land.
25846	8	a	Not good enough for even a rental, this 'Barnyard' should be burned for fear of mad cow disease
25847	3	a	A skillfully wrought, if somewhat predictable, farce involving belligerent opponents, blundering international peacekeepers and excitable journalists.
25848	6	a	Though it features some good laughs and decent performances, the movie never really goes anywhere.
25849	4	a	A fun and unpretentious romp that benefits from smart pacing, likeable characters and a stick-it-to-the-man undercurrent that helps keep things moving along.
25850	5	a	Expectations of farce are stymied by long stretches of mid-life navel gazing.
25851	3	a	Black or White is far from perfect, but it's an ideal way to kick off a healthy discussion on race in America.
25852	4	a	This DreamWorks film is not the sliced-bread marvel it has spent an enormous amount of money pretending to be. But it must be said that Seinfeld's script is a thing of wonder.
25853	2	a	Bleed for This is a scrapper, with solid mechanics and a true story that would otherwise be dismissed as too incredible for a movie. 
25854	6	a	Pictorial beauty in a David Lean sort of way and a mesmerizing quality might convince a viewer 'The Light Between Oceans,' a contrived and emotionally manipulative tale, has real credibility.
25855	3	a	a delightfully warm-hearted look at the joys and exasperations of both family and ethnic heritage, an ode to everyday people and the joys of romance turning into lifelong love.
25856	3	a	Pitt is quite good in the lead even if it does take close to two hours for him to show up in a matinee idol form we've all come to know. It's an underplayed performance, nicely pitched against great actresses.
25857	4	a	It's the most convincing and well-staged skydiving film ever.
25858	4	a	Subtle shades of friendship are lost in a melee of violence, which quickly crescendos and then maintains a one-note intensity for the duration of the film, punctuated only by an ill-advised narratorial voice that serves to keep the viewer at arm's length.
25859	2	a	Along the lines of a touchy-feely, sentimental cross-generational film such as 'On Golden Pond.'
25860	3	a	The story is fragmented into flashforwards and flashbacks as Alex's narration skirts around the traumatic event, but culminates in a low-key but meaningful realization of sorts for the quiet teen.
25861	1	a	Who knew that Ted Kennedy's story would feel so vital to the current climate in America. 
25862	5	a	The kind of lame, unimaginative comedy that constantly takes cheap shots at elderly characters, and then turns on a dime and begs you to see the humanity in them.
25863	6	a	Not even the ever-likable Seyfried at full-blast sun-kissed luminescence can win the battle against such trite, tired material nor make a viable leading man out of her pretty boy zero of a co-star.
25864	1	a	... a genuine honesty and realism that lets R-rated hilarity ensue from the truth instead of mere spectacle.
25865	4	a	Bening avoids doing an impersonation, but she's obviously studied the actress, and is able to suggest aspects of Grahame that made her so watchable on screen.
25866	3	a	Fincher renders the era with a precise eye for atmosphere and physical detail.
25867	3	a	Top notch spy thriller
25868	5	a	Failure To Launch tries very hard to break out of the romantic comedy formula with some additional wackiness and guy humor, but they might have been better sticking to the formula.
25869	4	a	Murder isn't allowed to become a distraction. Consequently, with all its haunting moodiness, moral alarm bells and relational issues, the film isn't much more than the unexpanded short story it derives from.
25870	1	a	A personal film in the best sense of the word.
25871	3	a	It still manages to squeeze a great deal of tension into yet another situation where we're already aware of the outcome.
25872	4	a	Somber, sinister, grimly sparse Australian Western, filled with pointless bloodshed and explicit violence.
25873	1	a	It's a remarkably powerful film and yet another reminder that the talent on board are some of the very best cinema has to offer.
25874	6	a	What starts off as a biting comedy turns out to have a soft, squishy middle.
25875	4	a	It's a surprise, really, that this entry is as much fun as it is, but trilogy looks about as far as this destination can go.
25876	3	a	Brilliant.
25877	1	a	Matthew McConaughey steals the show with a ferocious, transformative performance worthy of awards attention, and Friedkin restores his stature as an architect of taut, muscular cinema.
25878	1	a	Doing away with the formalities helps Chamber of Secrets immensely, allowing it to concentrate on unfolding its involving mystery, using the running time to pace the action and the development.
25879	1	a	Straight-ahead star power is provided by teeny-bop pop star Miley Cyrus as Penny and John Travolta who looks better as an animated dog than he did in drag in Hairspray.
25880	4	a	Whatever else it is--a romantic biopic without compromise--it is also, and for me, mostly, a celebration of the huge talent that is Abbie Cornish.
25881	3	a	"Funny, creative, and the refreshing heist movie of its genre since ""Ant-Man"", ""Logan Lucky"" is an entertaining romp from beginning to end."
25882	2	a	It's funnier and more polished than it deserves to be. There's absolutely nothing you can take seriously, which is a good thing since none of the cast seem to be taking it seriously themselves. So just sit back and, like them, enjoy the ride.
25883	2	a	New viewers will be a little bit lost, and old fans won't get quite everything they wanted, but there's enough going on in Serenity and it's all so much fun that it doesn't matter.
25884	1	a	"A ""Taxi Driver"" for the present day, with Hawke in a career-best performance."
25885	1	a	Von Trier is vicious when it comes to milking the melodrama.
25886	3	a	Some may cynically scoff at Country Strong's rollercoaster of feelings, yet it's almost completely appropriate considering the high drama present in the lyrics of country music.
25887	4	a	Death may not be quite as creative in past films, but the trick isn't in merely using a tanning bed or a nail gun to kill somebody. It's how you do it.
25888	3	a	Resident Evil is not a cautionary tale about scientific experiments gone awry; clearly, it's meant to be a blood-spattered, shoot 'em up, slice 'em and dice 'em, horror sci-fi popcorn flick to the nth degree.
25889	6	a	I'm happy to report Radio is tolerable. Better than tolerable, in fact, but not much better.
25890	0	a	Allows for a certain worldliness, cautiousness, and darkness in Indy's character. He's far from reckless or noble.
25891	1	a	A moving, suspenseful, exquisitely photographed look at an insane surgeon's activities.
25892	3	a	As with films typically released in January, the film's staying power is about nil once you leave the theatre, but you're certain to enjoy the time you spend watching it.
25893	3	a	The Bourne Identity crackles with equal measures of efficiency and energy.
25894	0	a	The drowsy surrealism and elaborate inconclusiveness of Donnie Darko will simultaneously guarantee it a rabid cult and put it way off limits to the don't-get-its.
25895	5	a	Knocked Up is like a Hallmark Greeting Card with crude verse. It's is an uneasy mix of ethnic humor, slacker humor, and human drama -- some is amusing, some is indulgent, and some is strained.
25896	5	a	What if they threw a satire and no jokes came? This is the question American Dreamz answers in its interminable running time.
25897	5	a	Whatever charms the first one had, the sequel badly misses the Diesel-injection.
25898	4	a	Arnold Schwarzenegger is a fool to think he'll make it as the Johnny Carson of action films.
25899	5	a	You can feel the flopsweat of the screenwriters, laboring to make their jokes work and their scenes interesting.
25900	4	a	Snakes on a Plane may not be a good movie by conventional standards, but with the proper amount of love via audience participation, this genre picture is exactly the sort of silly fun that mega-priced, B-grade tentpole films often fail to be.
25901	2	a	"Singleton's ""Baby Boy"" discovery, Tyrese, steps on the gas and leaves former star Diesel in the dust."
25902	5	a	Larry Crowne, Hanks' second effort behind the camera, makes It's a Wonderful Life look like Enter the Void. It's a cute movie that never meant to hurt no one, and that's the best thing I can say about it. 
25903	3	a	An eye for the devil in the details gives the story its heart -- a broken heart, but that's better than none at all.
25904	3	a	The movie is harrowing, as any story about Alzheimer's should be, but Moore gives it an extra layer of gravity and heartbreaking inevitability.
25905	3	a	"There's a sweetness to Italian director Nanni Moretti's ""We Have a Pope"" that belies its seemingly unholy premise..."
25906	6	a	By the end, everything that was initially serious about the film becomes silly and everything appealing about it turns sour.
25907	3	a	Harrison's life is a quest only for pleasure, and Kline and Dano definitely provide it, even if their arc is short and shallow. See it for Kevin.
25908	3	a	It's a delightful film, excellently acted and charged with undercurrents of familial emotion.
25909	5	a	"Can't hold a canndle to ""Girl Happy."
25910	0	a	Far from playing it safe, Romero sees this sequel as an opportunity to challenge the viewer.
25911	8	a	The new Phoenix lacks the very things that made the old one special.
25912	0	a	Deliriously funny and exciting.
25913	1	a	Director Ava DuVernay has given us Selma, a docudrama about a pivotal campaign in the fight for civil rights for black Americans. You could say this film writes history not so much with lightning as with compassion.
25914	1	a	an impressive, overripe cinematic feat that makes up for its somewhat pedestrian plotting with a stunning visual imagination that impresses in both the scope and detail with which it merges so many of del Toro's cultural obsessions
25915	1	a	[An] intriguing, mind-altering skateboard elegy.
25916	1	a	More than lives up to the promise Troche showed in Go Fish.
25917	4	a	The problem is the movie is too predictable--so predictable that it keeps it from truly generating suspense.
25918	2	a	A very moody, well made retelling of Stieg Larsson's book, but the film also lacks much purpose and sometimes focuses on the grim with an exploitative eye.
25919	6	a	A heavy slog.
25920	2	a	I liked the movie - it's certainly well made, and a lot of fun - but I mostly found myself laughing at it, not with it.
25921	1	a	It's hilarious and sad and, especially, entertaining.
25922	1	a	... Adds up to far more than the formula typically allows.
25923	3	a	Pike triumphs in this emotionally and physically taxing role.
25924	9	a	In this noisy, joyless, bizarrely static fiasco, every element on screen seems to let the air out of the one before it.
25925	5	a	A pleasant, inconsequential movie.
25926	3	a	While Benjamin Button demonstrates imagination, it doesn't inspire it.
25927	4	a	A great send-off for one of Hollywood's unlikeliest double acts.
25928	4	a	As lovely as it sometimes is, what this film needs is a little more shape and a little less ambience. It's a delicate balance admittedly tricky to achieve, but one that is clearly within the capability of this talented new filmmaker.
25929	6	a	"Eastwood faced similar issues with his last film, ""Sully,"" and he still hasn't figured out how to take a relatively short dramatic event and build a movie around it."
25930	0	a	Johansson [plays Charlotte] perfectly, with the kind of intelligent beauty that could bring Krzysztof Kieslowski out of his grave to cast her in a new Colors film.
25931	1	a	It's a tense, concise and elegantly shot film that creates a sense of menace from the very beginning - - and in a way that's unusual.
25932	4	a	It's ambitious as hell, and all three actors are up for the challenge, but the film's momentum slips away in the final movement when characters are separated and isolated by the demands of the plot.
25933	5	a	"When it shifts away from the relationship, it really starts to feel forced. You can feel Cahill's hand leading you down the path toward another ""discovery,"" and you can only hope the end will justify the means. Put simply, it doesn't."
25934	4	a	Enjoyable romantic comedy that is sharply written and frequently laugh-out-loud funny, thanks to a hilarious performance by supporting actor Kevin James.
25935	3	a	Its performances are appealing, and its heart's in the right place.
25936	6	a	Every story needs some kernel of internal logic, some hold on reality. But Lyne's film is like trying to scale a mountain of Jello. There's no solid ground. Everything is constantly shifting and undulating.
25937	4	a	A perfectly serviceable addition to a well-stocked genre that acts as a fine showcase for not only the strong cast but the timeless tunes that made Chess Records a cornerstone of popular music.
25938	1	a	As one who's ingested a lot of superhero comics, books, and movies over the years, I can attest that this works as a genuine superhero movie, not just as a family film.
25939	5	a	"Overplotted, undercooked and extremely well-dressed, ""The Dressmaker"" has style to burn, but it has a mean streak as wide as the Outback."
25940	10	a	One big problem with the film from the start: I never understood why being a Skull was so special in the first place.
25941	0	a	"Chicken Run's"" finale is on par both with ""The Great Escape"" and the classic Wallace and Gromit ending to ""A Close Shave"" for rousing excitement and ingenuity. When it comes to clever and fun entertainment with a twist, it's the cock of the walk."
25942	5	a	Byrd haphazardly assembles a bunch of overly exaggerated caricatures and parades them around in a dissolving farce that has all the wayward charm of a botched lobotomy
25943	4	a	Caffeine and nitroglycerine power this special effects thriller.
25944	6	a	Striking visuals tell a story where words aren't necessary ... until that turning point, when dull dialogue, a complicated plot and cheesy graphics start to muddle things.
25945	8	a	An elaborate letdown.
25946	9	a	The movie is less than nothing special.
25947	0	a	While it is definitely Fellini-esque, it's also a crystallization of Sorrentino's own distinctive style.
25948	0	a	Sentiment is explained by science as the family impulse that motivates so many Steven Spielberg stories is revealed to be an evolutionary imperative in this near-perfect action-adventure.
25949	6	a	This flick has little intrigue to tie it to its namesake and it comes off more like a very expensive John Woo spoof.
25950	3	a	Anthony Hopkins' first action movie casts him as a gentle, brainy tycoon stuck in the Alaskan wilderness with only voracious bears and, just as threatening, Alec Baldwin for company.
25951	7	a	Filled with so many improbabilities and leaps in narrative logic that it is, at times, quite ludicrous.
25952	2	a	Rude, crude and lewd. As nasty as it is naughty. Savagely satirical. Sexually disturbing. And absolutely for adults only. Most of that is a good thing.
25953	5	a	"Throws down a dare by expecting its audience to be the cool connoisseurs of the story's ""comic"" outrageousness, then rubbing viewers' faces in close-up scenes of brutality that reasonable people ought not to be able to watch."
25954	5	a	Disappointing, over-long and over-directed Oscar-bait drama that's further hampered by a trying-too-hard performance from Jamie Foxx, though the always-excellent Robert Downey Jr. ensures that it remains just about watchable.
25955	9	a	The idiotic story and low-rent animation will bore children to tears.
25956	6	a	A stodgy, dull, Southern-apologist rehash of the first half of the Civil War.
25957	3	a	James comes crashing nervously into the movie like a fat guy who went through the wrong door and ended up on the fashion show catwalk. He's perfect.
25958	4	a	Guaranteed to put you off suggested Sunday outings for life.
25959	5	a	Dour and charmless.
25960	3	a	It's extremely clear, from start to finish, that the master is back -- and he's going to show all the Romero-wannabes how to craft a truly great zombie movie.
25961	5	a	"It's like if ""Whiplash"" was intended as motivational. "
25962	3	a	The fourth, most commercially successful Bond to date, is known for its pre-credits sequences, underwater battles, and escalating number of violent deaths.
25963	5	a	Neither good enough to be an instant classic nor bad enough to disappear from video stores' seasonal rental shelves for many Christmases to come.
25964	6	a	Setting out to be both a parody and the very thing that it's parodying, the movie comes up short on both accounts.
25965	6	a	In my view, Bernardo Bertolucci is one of the world's most overrated high profile filmmakers.
25966	0	a	an instant classic of dystopic angst
25967	5	a	It's frenetic and knowing in the modern manner, though, a couple of good gags apart, not very funny. Its patchiness merely demonstrates the gap between Pixar and the rest of the field - which is the distance between genius and talent.
25968	4	a	A worthy but slightly cold adaptation of a classic American novel that fails to fully engage the audience's sympathy despite first-rate performances and some sublime camerawork by multiple Oscar nominee Roger Deakins.
25969	3	a	Director of photography Benoit Delhomme shot the movie in delicious colors, and the costumes and sets are grand.
25970	5	a	It's sometimes wondrous and often amazingly goofy.
25971	6	a	If you thought Matthew McConaughey lost his mind awhile back when he was caught playing the bongos naked in his home, wait until you see him in Reign of Fire.
25972	6	a	A mildly amusing political satire from Moretti, which is relevant but not witty or ferocious enough.
25973	4	a	It's borderline parody of a kind of fey filmmaking popular at crunchy-granola festivals, but the counterfeit aesthetic is ultimately outshone by the life-affirming message.
25974	1	a	Almost as good as its predecessor.
25975	4	a	At least there's director Nick Park's playful Silly Putty visual imagination to take your mind off just how thin the story is.
25976	3	a	Weinstein's ability to notch up the dramatic side of the story without bringing manipulative tricks into play is praiseworthy. His work serves up a tart platter that gives you food for thought.
25977	9	a	Save yourself the trouble of watching it and just check out Goodfellas instead.
25978	3	a	By the end of Secret Window, I was too busy being amused by the film's undeniable sense of thrills to care that much about the flaws.
25979	3	a	Classic sci-fi tropes blend with rambunctious fight choreography along with a witty and touching story about letting go of the past while fighting for the now.
25980	4	a	Every internal decision, from cameo casting to the eerie quiet of the sound design enclosing us in this air-conditioned luxury coffin, is just about unimprovable.
25981	2	a	"George A. Romero's Land of the Dead is a decent follow up to his classic ""Dead"" trilogy, delivering compelling characters, a thrilling narrative, and plenty of zombie action/gore."
25982	3	a	There's a lot of sadness, but the film's grasp of small human truths and sense of low-key humor keep it afloat.
25983	4	a	"although [Close] brings truth to her performance, the quietness and unassuming blankness of the character may temper critical and audience response in much the same way as Peter Seller's alien remove did in ""Being There."
25984	10	a	Little Man is so childish and absurd that there should probably be a law against seeing it. The penalty: seeing it again.
25985	5	a	About as much fun as standing in line at Customs for hours after a long-haul flight.
25986	4	a	as a tribute to Chess and its importance to modern music, this is half-baked heritage, entertaining but incomplete.
25987	3	a	Riveting entertainment thanks to its three leads and evocative production design, Crimson Peak is also surprisingly heartbreaking.
25988	0	a	I walked in there all crabby, tired, bitter, and sad, and I walked out with a beatific smile on my face that not even Beowulf could remove entirely.
25989	7	a	The film goes to the dogs. They don't steal the scenes, they are the scenes. They bring so much personality that it's hard for any of the actors to compete, even the kids.
25990	7	a	Feels more like an extended riff than a fully fleshed-out film.
25991	5	a	Is this guy qualified to save an entire holiday?
25992	1	a	...founded on a communal sense of historical accomplishment.
25993	2	a	Actor and director work hand in hand to make this road to recovery as harrowing as possible -- you will feel every bite of the screws bored into Vinny's skull.
25994	5	a	All-in-all, what we have here is 'classic' Seagal. And that means, for anyone who isn't an admitted fan, an uninspired outing.
25995	3	a	Funny, pathetic, sad, absurdist -- writer-director John Herzfeld plays it any number of ways, and makes them all work.
25996	5	a	Perhaps the greatest tragedy of The Vanishing of Sidney Hall is that nobody told writer/director Shawn Christensen that his gag-on-impact green smoothie of dated arthouse tropes was, in fact, a comedy. 
25997	6	a	Rising is beautifully made, its rich colors emphasizing the atmosphere of decadence and waste, but it's not especially dramatic.
25998	0	a	The subtle build of anticipation makes the coming of age romance Call Me By Your Name so irresistibly delicious. 
25999	0	a	What marks Parker and Stone as satirists rather than shock jocks is their perceptive analysis of the world's craziness.
26000	1	a	The world the characters inhabit is less expressionist than impressionist, blessed with a delicate evocation of natural light and color that subtly incorporates Miyazaki's environmentalism. 
26001	4	a	It isn't quite a religious experience, but it is a sweet one. In other words: We have a charmer.
26002	7	a	"Did he hire three non-actors or only two?"" Well, to tell you the truth, in all this tedium I kind of lost track myself."
26003	4	a	while still further proof Tim Allen was always better suited to Television, is one of the Toolman's best forays into film. The bottom line is kids will get a kick out of it, and parents can rest assure by the end of it's hour and a half they'll have had s
26004	4	a	The film roars with rapid-fire chatter and a great deal of heated arguing. It becomes abrasive and oppressive, and we yearn for a break.
26005	5	a	The performances are good, the visuals are lush, the span is epic, but the film simply never soars.
26006	0	a	A thought-proving and entirely moving portrait of human arrogance -- in general and with some very, very specific examples.
26007	6	a	Inside this film, a poignant and personal story is struggling to get out. But it's couched in such awkward sentiments that it can't emerge.
26008	6	a	Laurel Canyon is neither profound or particularly insightful about the Mephistophelean bargain that success in show business often represents. But it is also never dull, riding along on McDormand's blazing performance.
26009	7	a	Could have been a solid, straightforward rom com coasting on likable leads; half-hearted additions trying to link the movie to economic crisis just detract.
26010	3	a	A visually astonishing picture that brings script, performance and, alas, displays of violence up to the modern standard.
26011	3	a	It's a smart script that has a nice respect for books, ideas and the written word.
26012	3	a	"From the first smoky notes of a theme song sung by Adele, it's clear that ""Skyfall"" will be both classic and of-the-moment."
26013	3	a	It all adds up to an entertaining mash of suspense and melodrama.
26014	0	a	Meticulously researched and elegantly scripted by debuting screenwriter Paul Webb, Selma toggles between moments big and small, though everything feels necessary.
26015	2	a	No, it doesn't stand up to March of the Penguins or soar like Winged Migration, but this family-friendly flick does manage the happy feat of raising eco-awareness.
26016	5	a	Weighted down with a turgid story and utterly middling special effects, The Fantastic Four isn't likely to be Stan Lee's favorite of the nearly dozen Marvel Comics adaptations either out already or on their way.
26017	7	a	The writing is lazy, the movie focuses on all the wrong things and the tone lurches unpleasantly between gum-soft comedy and lukewarm thriller.
26018	4	a	Teller totally immerses himself in the physically taxing role and the movie distinguishes itself thanks to its painstaking depiction of the real-life Paz's grueling comeback.
26019	4	a	Chen and Chiu's genuine, rarely cloying performances along with Cheung's urgent sincerity add immeasurably to this timely film's many modest pleasures.
26020	9	a	Some more whine with your waffling? All of you?
26021	3	a	A movie with an appeal almost impossible to describe.
26022	6	a	The movie's simplistic storyline does not match its stunning visual accomplishments.
26023	6	a	About as impressive as rival gangs of Renaissance Pleasure Faire geeks launching bottle rockets and flaming rolls of toilet paper at each other.
26024	1	a	Its gimmick allows, in our post-ironic era, big musical production numbers in Central Park
26025	3	a	Marvin won an Oscar for his dual good guy/bad guy portrayal.
26026	6	a	strictly ordinary and joins the ranks of the soon to be forgotten
26027	2	a	This new Bourne adventure, adapted from Robert Ludlum's book, is somewhat too long and burdened with one too many exhaustingly chaotic car chases, but it's still almost as intelligent, exciting and fun as its predecessor.
26028	0	a	The first and finest Indiana Jones adventure.
26029	7	a	Miami Vice is long, dull and dark and does little to stimulate the moviegoer's mind or eye.
26030	9	a	We never get the feel that this is a monumental conflict with nothing less than the human species at stake.
26031	4	a	Winslet gives a fearless performance here. It's not her fault her husband has shrouded it in Taste.
26032	4	a	The badly titled American Violet comes from filmmakers who had clearly made up their minds long before they had written a word. And it's aimed at people who have too, before they've seen a frame.
26033	5	a	It's as if there were a terrible telephone connection between the film's vivid sound track and its tepid romantic melodrama, to which the music is supposed to give style and substance.
26034	5	a	A very predictable and obvious film... but the impassable presence of Lane and the claim of gastronomy as one of the greatest pleasures of life are worth the price of the ticket. [Full review in Spanish]
26035	1	a	Filmmaker David Fincher is extremely conscious of the details he needs to exhibit to keep each isolated moment at a highly concentrated level.
26036	0	a	An incredibly well-executed thriller that transcends its admittedly pulpy and occasionally ridiculous source material with an extraordinary degree of technical skil
26037	7	a	This love story never convincingly goes beyond the depth of two good-looking people falling in love based on their looks.
26038	7	a	Not Easily Broken would make a decent parable for use in a church sermon, but does not deserve your hard-earned money to be seen in an overly padded movie format.
26039	4	a	The cynical film has its fun poking fun at college life, the system and marriage.
26040	4	a	Like the guards in the film, Armored knows it has a job to do, and established procedures to follow, and that it's just another day at the office. But if a job is worth doing, it's worth doing well ...
26041	9	a	Early on, Lucy informs the crew there's been a 'failure to engage.' I think she was talking about the movie.
26042	3	a	Sausage Party has plenty of funny moments, especially for fans of lowbrow humor.
26043	2	a	Palo Alto displays a keen eye and ear for teenage interaction.
26044	6	a	Ah, the London Blitz. Bombs falling, buildings on fire, people dying all around. Good times, good times.
26045	10	a	Controversy over whether it will inflame anti-Semitism guarantees huge audiences, and many people may be profoundly moved. But as a film it is quite bad.
26046	0	a	Brutal, brilliant, depressing and riveting.
26047	6	a	The screenplay by Christopher McQuarrie and Nathan Alexander introduces a seemingly endless series of characters, but there's no time to flesh any of them out enough to make you worry about their fate.
26048	4	a	Woo is a singularly graceful filmmaker, a true believer in the power of elegant stunt choreography and the infinite allure of the human face.
26049	9	a	It's not every movie that would announce its shortcomings right in its title.
26050	1	a	A winning comedy-drama built around one of cinema's most endearing leading ladies.
26051	6	a	Furman has a true story and a compelling cast on his side, but his bland direction leaves The Infiltrator struggling to find its own identity.
26052	0	a	Not only is the film an interesting real-life drama, it also works as a buddy comedy thanks to the versatile performances of both Steve Coogan and Judi Dench.
26053	1	a	The Savages proves there's a rich vein of humor to be mined from the darkest of themes.
26054	6	a	A tough watch.
26055	5	a	Less outrageous than simply desperate.
26056	4	a	Not a complete success but enchanting performances and one especially superior showing by Aniston make it a decent watch.
26057	6	a	The result is more tedious than insightful, and the film just meekly limps along, without any wit, passion or fire.
26058	5	a	The Skulls? More like numbskulls.
26059	3	a	The Way Back is an inspiring story that is beautifully photographed and full of interesting and well acted characters.
26060	3	a	William Freidkin's film is full-frontal in every sense, an unabashed pulp romp stuffed with ugly acts and primal screams.
26061	1	a	More than just a film, David Fincher's THE CURIOUS CASE OF BENJAMIN BUTTON is a genuine accomplishment. It stylistically shows a span of history, carefully orchestrating an evolution of style and mood that tracks the passing years.
26062	6	a	It's like dating Britney Spears. Too much drama.
26063	2	a	While it is well acted and well written, the execution does sometimes have a Hallmark-Movie-of-the-Week feel to it, heavy on the portentous drama and intrusive score.
26064	5	a	This is Hitchcock for a tabloid audience: simplistic, judgemental, smug and pat. Rewatch the actual films instead.
26065	0	a	You'd have to be a heathen to argue with the fact that Raiders of the Lost Ark stands as the best action-adventure movie ever made.
26066	4	a	Good enough to make one have faith in certain things again, like spy movies, sequels and the charismatically low-key, quietly lethal movie-star charisma of Matt Damon.
26067	3	a	Sacha Gervasi's broadly enjoyable pop-art biopic about Alfred Hitchcock and the making of Psycho ...
26068	2	a	There is in fact much to relish in this epic but somehow, despite a nearly four-hour running time, there is something missing.
26069	4	a	Sticking closely to formula, Disney delivers a sweet script and charming storybook backgrounds, with serviceable, if sappy, songs from Carly Simon.
26070	3	a	Are guaranteed to cause alarm and even tears.
26071	7	a	The design is uninteresting, the characters are bland and the story is terrible.
26072	4	a	...off-kilter and persistently irreverent...
26073	9	a	The problem with Diary of a Wimpy Kid is the wimpy kid is a jerk.
26074	3	a	From screaming mandrake plants to animal transfiguration to ethereal letters literally hanging in the air, [Columbus'] approach to the books' enchanting elements is marvelous to behold.
26075	6	a	More bewildering than entertaining.
26076	3	a	Intelligent and sensitive and assembled with a great care, and worth watching just for its images of the jungle ...
26077	5	a	Though it has moments of inspiration...at best the picture is only fitfully amusing, certainly not up to the standard set by the 'South Park' movie.
26078	2	a	Alexander Payne once again proves that he is a director who will always deliver meaningful content in his films.
26079	6	a	This material requires a great deal more suspension of disbelief than even this hokey genre normally demands.
26080	6	a	What the audience ends up with is a watered down whitewash of Kallen's life story.
26081	6	a	You could attempt to summarize the plot of 'Stay' -- or could try to catch the morning fog in a butterfly net: Either activity would produce the same results.
26082	5	a	Somehow, Schneider enthusiasts will find their needed escapism in a clueless comedy that has more holes in it than rotted Swiss cheese.
26083	3	a	[Sharif] imbues this seemingly simple man with the wisdom that age brings the lucky ones -- his Ibrahim is a subdued Zorba the Greek.
26084	6	a	Barnyard is not without laughs, but they come in inverse proportion to the viewer's age.
26085	4	a	I don't mind a film with a surprise ending but, rather than enhancing the film, the climactic revelation in Fight Club cancels out everything previously seen. In fact, the bitter end of the film is a hypocritical cop-out.
26086	4	a	Miller gives a go-for-broke performance as the increasingly desperate and undone Sedgwick. But she lacks the fragile charisma evident in even the coarsest Warhol films, and without it there's no reason to care.
26087	3	a	For women, it purveys the dream that men really, really care about what they think. For men, it holds out the fantasy that babes are attracted to geeky men who really, really care about what they think. What's not to like?
26088	0	a	The film triumphs thanks to Chalamet's performance, as it's hard to recall seeing a young actor turn in as accomplished a performance as he manages here.
26089	5	a	An abusive, shallow, sleazy gangsta film that, at best, is a cautionary morality tale.
26090	6	a	Awash with celebrity, the documentary is a rubbernecker's delight.
26091	3	a	What I couldn't predict was how much I would enjoy the simple pleasures of a warm, witty, well-written story -- especially when it is told with the state-of-the-art computer animation that is easy to take for granted in these techno-savvy days.
26092	1	a	Tender but never sappy, Monsieur Ibrahim brings two people of vastly different age and background together in ways that are touching, and telling.
26093	6	a	Stupid, silly and gory.
26094	2	a	The young actor does his best, and, whereas we certainly root for his character, the movie is just too formulaic to be able to recommend it.
26095	1	a	Nearly any other film would be guilty of lionizing it subject. Certainly that's a danger given the nature of both the woman A Private War portrays and the issues it discusses.
26096	3	a	Even without handicapping for the limitations of its gentle genre, the film has moments of whimsical humor and thoughtful plotting that soar tantalizingly close to something that could be enjoyed on its own merits.
26097	2	a	There is something so incredibly special about these characters and seeing them come to life on the big screen.
26098	3	a	Garbage Dreams's images have the unsettling primal power of a dystopian sci-fi movie come to life.
26099	6	a	A sumptuously photographed road trip that becomes a dramatically inert journey of self-discovery.
26100	1	a	A completely charming reality-based romantic fantasy, both sweet-natured and sympathetic.
26101	6	a	A scattershot ensemble piece that exceeds its reach in its retelling of the origins of Chicago's Chess label.
26102	4	a	...counts on its audience not thinking about what they're seeing, but instead being mesmerized by flash and boom ...This is a movie to make you angry, but not with the straw evildoers it puts on screen.
26103	5	a	The movie plays like a global-political farce made by people who've never left the Upper West Side.
26104	5	a	..little action, almost no suspense or believable tension, one-dimensional characters up the wazoo and sets that can only be described as sci-fi generic.
26105	4	a	Another mindless adventure flick you can add to my Guilty Pleasures pile.
26106	7	a	We're starting to think Martin Lawrence's presence might not be a sign of quality.
26107	9	a	This new movie's got hot bods to spare; it's just too bad they belong to some of the most annoying characters I've seen in the movies all year.
26108	8	a	Two Weeks Notice is a defiantly unoriginal film that attempts to coast on the putative charm and speculative chemistry of Sandra Bullock and Hugh Grant.
26109	3	a	The movie gets credit for not making the high life seem colorful or funny.
26110	1	a	This is filmmaking on a grand scale.
26111	3	a	A thoughtful and provocative film about the way we live now.
26112	3	a	Haynes designs a perfectly nostaglic sensory experience - something like a Manhattan department store window - needing a suppler story to sell.
26113	9	a	Spielberg should have sued for 'breach of earth-shattering stupidity'.
26114	3	a	sets an atmosphere of creepiness that doesn't let up
26115	4	a	"Evelyn"" is one of those uplifting underdog tales that threatens to drown the audience in treacle, but screenwriter Paul Pender and director Beresford offset the kiddies' plight with enough matey jockeying jocularity among the male"
26116	4	a	Does the title refer to the plot device or the final cut?
26117	9	a	Envision what food poisoning does to a gastrointestinal tract. Now think of that substance as fodder for the lowest aiming standup act in America.
26118	2	a	Follows the standard crude romantic comedy formula, but it does so with remarkable intelligence. It's not just crude and funny, it's also perceptive and smart.
26119	3	a	The bigscreen version does not disappoint, though the non-anointed may find both the genre and this particular storyline a bit more dense than the usual American studio animation.
26120	4	a	Gore fans will doubtless enjoy the film, which could spin off several more sequels. After all, Death is the one villain you can't ever kill off.
26121	6	a	The outcome of the election is never in doubt in this fluff, and neither is the dramatic face-off.
26122	2	a	The film even manages things neatly at the end: we get a mixture of closure and openness, in which things are rounded off, yet there's still the possibility of another adventure.
26123	3	a	How America responds to the concept of its funny girl, drained of her effervescence, wearing bad sneakers and slumming it with the ordinary people, remains to be seen, but it's heartening to see Aniston challenging herself.
26124	9	a	This neurotic comedy tiptoes from one boring setback to the next, bottling its issues in schmaltz, and thus, costing the film its heart. 
26125	5	a	The novelty was refreshingly spry and creative in its first go-around. But guess what--the butt-kicking shellshockers are running out of excuses to exist in their campy chaos
26126	3	a	The movie has been attacked as pro-drug and defended as anti-drug, but actually it is simply pragmatic. It knows that addiction leads to an unmanageable, exhausting, intensely uncomfortable daily routine, and it knows that only two things make it bearable
26127	5	a	Maybe it's a wonderful inside joke - a suspenseless suspense film.
26128	5	a	"An awfully contrived and awkward ""true-life"" drama, film tries desperately to be a crowd-pleaser without delivering the necessary narrative punch or action."
26129	1	a	Have you noticed that the older he gets, the more Matt Damon resembles Ray Liotta? 'It's essential preparation for my remake of Operation Dumbo Drop,' notes Matt.
26130	6	a	There's no Jane Goodall required. And the absence of humans proves we needn't be onscreen to make our presence known.
26131	8	a	"It all comes down to the ""Olympiad,"" a battle of idiotic proportions between the two camps, and if you can't guess what happens next, this just may be the movie for you."
26132	3	a	Intelligence is Tina Fey's trademark. You could always see it right in the frames she wears for her eyeglasses.
26133	4	a	There are some nifty things in between the lulls...
26134	0	a	A rich, rewarding, polished diamond of a film.
26135	6	a	When the stars aren't charming the viewer, the film is busy shooting itself in the foot.
26136	0	a	It's great to see a movie so courageous and affecting, so committed to its own differentness.
26137	3	a	An oft-confusing, occasionally silly mega-expensive thrill ride that, for sheer audacity, is the biggest thing to come down the cinematic pike since Avatar.
26138	0	a	As screen chemistry goes, they've cooked up the strongest of stuff.
26139	4	a	Were you expecting a teen remake of The Hands of Orlac? Don't hold your breath.
26140	3	a	"Boating"" is an offbeat and rather moving romantic comedy, an ensemble piece in which Hoffman's generosity towards his co-stars is palpable."
26141	4	a	This movie feels more like a relapse than anything else, nestling back into an old habit.
26142	5	a	It's ye olde clash of religion and science, though the real struggle is between coherence and cockamamy grandiloquence.
26143	6	a	After it's over, the nagging feeling will hit you in the parking lot that it really doesn't make any sense.
26144	4	a	Writer/director Malcolm D. Lee delivers a relatable comedy that drops viewers off in this family that just happens to be African-American.
26145	5	a	The shallow characters and simple writing make the movie seem like a cartoon
26146	5	a	We understand -- immediately, like in the second or third scene, thank you -- that they are tragically suppressed; why should we care?
26147	1	a	A dubious proposition for the Francophobic, but it acquits itself with a script so ridiculous that it can't help but be engaging.
26148	6	a	". I hate to label this lightweight romp a ""chick flick"", but when the title actually issues a challenge to the fairer sex, well, the writing is on the wall."
26149	6	a	Once John Carter gets past laying out the specifics of the various Martian cultures and tensions, it settles into a pleasant groove that recalls the old Saturday afternoon serials.
26150	3	a	The name everyone will be talking about after seeing this movie is Casey Affleck.
26151	0	a	Such is the power of McDonagh's screenplay, that you'll feel as though you've been taken on a journey that's as profound and moving as it is -- at times -- shocking and thought-provoking.
26152	3	a	Knocked Up reinvents the romantic comedy for a new generation.
26153	3	a	Embrace of the Serpent is a mystical movie missile from Colombia. It's ballistic, balletic, sometimes brilliant.
26154	3	a	You don't need a deep, dark forest to tell an unsettling fable about the struggle for freedom or the battles waged between the shadows and the things that glow.
26155	3	a	You'll spend hours after seeing it trying to figure out how [the Nolan Brothers] did the trick.
26156	3	a	Sade is Quills without the hyperbole and melodrama.
26157	6	a	Vaughn is a guy's-guy kind of actor -- his characters are more comfortable shooting pool or knocking back beers than getting romantic on the couch -- so it's no surprise that the chemistry he generates is with Favreau rather than Aniston.
26158	4	a	It is disturbing, to say the least, and seems destined for 'cult classic' status.
26159	3	a	The best blend of human activity with computer animation since 'Who Framed Roger Rabbit?'
26160	4	a	Sporadically entertaining, light, shallow, self-plagiarising.
26161	4	a	Worthy of thine attention? Corset is.
26162	1	a	The spirit that emanates from the setting, characters, relationships and direction is brilliant.
26163	1	a	A stunning indictment of institutional betrayal. It plays like a Catholic Watergate, going right to the top with hard evidence that stuns, dismays and sickens.
26164	3	a	It says something for Almodovar's skill as a filmmaker that he can still jolt viewers after three and a half decades in the business.
26165	5	a	Do you wonder how this movie will turn out? As with most romantic comedies, the joy is in the journey.
26166	4	a	Taken bite by bite and with a measure of patience, Moorhouse's directorial return is as delightfully chaotic as Tilly's homecoming, a colorful, one-of-a-kind affair that's not afraid to shake things up a bit.
26167	3	a	Deliciously slow-paced film.
26168	0	a	Anyone who ever told you that a sequel couldn't be as good as the original needs to see this.
26169	4	a	The humor is tasteless and racist, but the action scenes are fantastically choreographed and executed.
26170	4	a	We're not talking a Disney treasure here, but if Treasure Planet falls short of gem status, it should provide youngsters with a reasonable amount of diversion.
26171	6	a	Stay attempts to justify the entire price of admission with its ending twist.
26172	4	a	Woman Walks Ahead is a solidly crafted and well shot, if basically unchallenging film.
26173	7	a	The movie delves into a weak exploration of Hunt's private life.
26174	9	a	The Savages naturally invites comparisons to Away From Her--all of them unflattering.
26175	0	a	Inspiring, sentimental tale of survival.
26176	5	a	Save for its dalliance with the everyman action movie, there's no surprises in Paul Blart: Mall Cop, another largely listless comedy from Sandler's Happy Madison production company.
26177	5	a	The movie's final attempts at tugging at the viewer's heartstrings ultimately fall flat, and it's consequently impossible to label The Soloist as anything other than a well-intentioned misfire.
26178	3	a	A wittily self-referential romp about the disillusionment of age.
26179	3	a	Scott has seldom been this playful in a film, save for a few moments perhaps in Thelma and Louise.
26180	0	a	There's something both simple and sweet about Bolt, yet epic, that's entirely surprising.
26181	6	a	Neither supergood nor superbad, but passable doesn't exactly raise the bar.
26182	3	a	It sticks to the rules of its genre, right down to the cloying music and obligatory schmaltzy climax, and uses them to demonstrate a truth that should be obvious: all love stories are essentially the same.
26183	3	a	A dynamic and captivating bio-drama of a gifted young ballet dancer from communist China and his quest for respect, love, and a new life of freedom.
26184	9	a	A crushing bore. Even Connery can't save this one.
26185	3	a	Some people find this twisty and twisted psychological thriller arty and pretentious. I find it arty and provocative.
26186	6	a	Somehow, despite that boatload of talent, the movie never really comes together.
26187	3	a	Once it dropped a lot of its satirical baggage, I was able to stop considering it an important film, and start watching it as an entertaining one.
26188	0	a	Best of the Bonds, thanks in no small part to Diana Rigg.
26189	1	a	So many incredibly raw, wrenching--and, crucially, unsparingly unsentimental--scenes and moments that it's impossible to not be haunted by the film.
26190	3	a	With Caine and Duvall two kings of the acting jungle in top form; more proof why good casting directors are worth their weight in black gold.
26191	3	a	Is the film more than a novelty plaything? Perhaps not. But within its confines it multi-achieves.
26192	3	a	The Imitation Game is a great biopic. The trouble is, biopics just ain't that great.
26193	2	a	There's check-your-brains-at-the-door and then there's brain-dead. Fast Five, the improbable fourth sequel to The Fast and the Furious, falls somewhere between the two. 
26194	6	a	A cold, calculating virtual redux of The Bourne Identity that leaves a bitter aftertaste in its wake. Audiences have seen this all before, many times over.
26195	0	a	The inner tension of the film emerges from Jackson's enjoyment of the girls' bustling insanity and then his gradual withdrawal from it.
26196	4	a	Even if it might not satisfy the generations who grew up on Bellairs' book, it'll probably be good enough for their kids.
26197	3	a	"Skyfall"" is a different kind of Bond movie, one that works just fine on its own terms, but a steady diet of this might kill the franchise. One ""Skyfall"" is enough."
26198	1	a	Created as the movie your perverted older brother made in high school but you can't help but love him for it, the definitely offensive but enthusiastically rapturous romp is the surprise hit of the summer.
26199	3	a	Not since Thelma and Louise has Scott showcased such wonderfully eccentric and memorable characters.
26200	6	a	A cynical attempt to cash in on the popularity of Warner Bros. cartoon characters and basketball player Michael Jordan, inspired by a Nike commercial.
26201	4	a	A fervent, sweet-natured tragic romance.
26202	3	a	It will be hard to lure audiences to this downer, but its acute understanding of such a monster's misery furthers our comprehension of how and why human atrocities occur.
26203	4	a	It's a pleasant enough way to mark time, which is exactly what the rest of the Disney crew is doing -- until inspiration, like a beam from the far end of the galaxy, strikes again.
26204	3	a	Expect a map, and you'll be sorely disappointed. Work to make one, and you'll be happily addicted.
26205	5	a	Star power is an interesting thing, especially when it goes wrong.
26206	6	a	I like what it was about more than how it was about it. 
26207	6	a	"Another cheapie from the producers of ""Paranormal Activity."" Aims low, but hits its target."
26208	0	a	Sharif gives a wonderfully understated performance . . .a half-smile, a pursed lip, fills the screen with the warm glow of emotions deeply felt and expertly rendered.
26209	10	a	At least Gaulke and Wolf didn't have to go far to kill their reputation: During the jungle piranha attack scene, a mallard floats by in the background.
26210	3	a	A hilarious, vulgar, crude, smutty film that will have you snickering at jokes you'd like to think that you're above.
26211	6	a	It's more of a graduate seminar kind of fun than a Singin' in the Rain kind of fun.
26212	4	a	a watchable, but otherwise unremarkable flick.
26213	9	a	There is exactly ONE scene worth watching in Rob Schneider's latest pathetic romp... is it worth ten bucks? No way in hell.
26214	4	a	There's such a good-natured heart beating beneath the cliches that it's easy to appreciate the film's willingness to poke gentle fun without a whiff of nastiness or judgment.
26215	3	a	An irresistible gimmick meets a warm, witty presentation. It's no bother at all...
26216	9	a	The animation is so stiff it makes South Park look like Walt Disney's Fantasia.
26217	3	a	Love, Simon is a fun and surprisingly deep film that sets a new standard for the teen comedy genre while also breaking new ground in its portrayal of coming out.
26218	0	a	It's exhilarating, in a violent sort of way. It's witty. And it's completely engaging. 
26219	2	a	I wasn't quite as impressed as I was apparently supposed to be, and I feel oddly left out because of that.
26220	4	a	All Zhang's splendor does is foster cognitive dissonance in an audience.
26221	4	a	Really, this a two-hander that unfolds at two distinctly separate speeds.
26222	4	a	The Technicolour film's strongest suit remains the way it captures the jubilant celebrations in the city, and the dance sequences which showcase the samba skills of the leads.
26223	1	a	A nice mix of arthouse quirk and genuine heart.
26224	0	a	The Adventures of Baron Munchausen is a fairy tale of large heart and limitless vision. Like its maker, it staunchly defies the exigencies of reason to pursue a bigger vision of imagination.
26225	1	a	The film itself is a magically strange hybrid, a spoofy computer-animated Western acted out by anthropomorphic desert creatures.
26226	5	a	"Think Like a Man Too might have been more accurately titled ""Think Like the Most Hackneyed Rom-com Team Around.''"
26227	2	a	[Looks] better not only than effects-driven movies of the same period, but better, frankly, than half of what gets released nowadays.
26228	4	a	Though shrapnel-ridden and faulted, still stands proud. 
26229	9	a	A convoluted, discombobulated take on a small-town drama, Lake City shifts gears so often it never gets out of the driveway.
26230	3	a	Before getting into what Man of the Year is actually about though this is a related subject it should be noted that the film allows Robin Williams a return to comedic form. Williams, who has shaped up as a very potent actor in drama...
26231	3	a	The story is so gripping and the ensemble performances so dominating that Donaldson really manages to disguise the fact that the movie is just a succession of conversations between middle-aged white men.
26232	9	a	As inane, sloppily edited, painfully awkward and unintentionally funny as an Uwe Boll film. 
26233	4	a	Where Chamber of Secrets will be viewed a success is in accurately, and occasionally imaginatively, bringing the book to life. As a movie, judged on its own merits, it's too long, too slow and too unfocused.
26234	3	a	This is a resounding return to form for Payne: there are moments that recall his earlier road movies About Schmidt and Sideways, but it has a wistful, shuffling, grizzly-bearish rhythm all of its own.
26235	4	a	The story takes forever to get going, but this animated caper is fizzing with bright ideas, the best of which is a skit featuring all of Disney's princesses.
26236	3	a	As emotionally and racially charged as the film's story is, director Ava DuVernay is determined to deliver a full-bodied, balanced drama that derives its power from the central fight for understanding and respect.
26237	0	a	If there's one thing Marsh knows, it's how to reach your deepest emotions. He did it with 'Man on Wire,' and he does it again here.
26238	6	a	May be slick, but it's as cold and dehumanized as a robot.
26239	9	a	A tour-de-farce of depressing inanity, that's unable to do anything more than offer a messy, incoherent pastiche of other, better movies.
26240	3	a	Smart, sweet and emotionally rich.
26241	6	a	Heartfelt but fatally overwrought romantic melodrama.
26242	0	a	A landscape-changing film for what it represents, as well as for what it contains.
26243	3	a	It's time for the Barden Bellas to either exit stage left or be dragged off by the hook.
26244	6	a	full review in Greek
26245	6	a	Benefits from a good voice cast, bright and beautiful animation, and very funny and charming moments. 
26246	2	a	The performances are uniformly good.
26247	0	a	Godard's ode to a hooker remains a bleak, sexy and heartbreaking work of art
26248	1	a	From the opening shot, in which two Brazilian musicians literally burst through the frame, one can sense the explosiveness of Black Orpheus.
26249	9	a	Let's face it. This whole movie is based on stereotypes.
26250	4	a	The heartwrenching tearjerker love story surfaces at the end as a winner by a narrow decision.
26251	3	a	"Call Me By Your Name"" is transcendent in its first hour, communicating much through the camera's evocation of nature and the screenplay's clear yet subtle dialogue."
26252	6	a	A more dramatic story and tauter screenplay would have turned it into a true blue horror film. But in the present form, the only feeling it evokes is of sadness brought out by the fact that a brilliant opportunity got lost. 
26253	2	a	For a melodrama concerned with emotional pain, this fairy tale favours formal trickery over human connection to a fault.
26254	3	a	I can't shake the notion that The Incredibles may not be all it might have been. It stomps all the expected bases instead of streaking by with daring innovation. 
26255	8	a	"You know how sometimes something can be so bad that it's almost good? Well, that's more or less the case here, with stress on the word ""less."
26256	0	a	It is a question without an answer in Shame, which does not deliver a message in any formal way, but simply offers people and their lives and leaves us to conclude what we choose. 
26257	0	a	A meticulously shot and sharply written character study, it plays like a blend of the Coen brothers and Quentin Tarantino.
26258	2	a	A parody on sexual preoccupation in a pastel-colored unreality.
26259	6	a	Fugit ably keeps this superficially controversial, and yet actually rather conventional, film from devolving into obnoxious oddness.
26260	3	a	While Apatow's movie isn't perfect, it's still a fumbling and funny valentine to the shock of pregnancy, the reality of love and the chaos of all that comes after.
26261	3	a	Amy Adams provides the pixie dust that turns New York into a land of enchantment.
26262	9	a	Admittedly, I was not expecting much from a film whose television trailer features Meg Ryan screaming every two seconds ... but even I was surprised at the level of ineptitude.
26263	5	a	A formula movie about Meg Ryan wearing skimpy clothes and uttering dialogue as painful as the heels in which she's strutting. 
26264	6	a	There's just enough of a hint at something interesting beneath the surface to make you wish Ozon had actually had the nerve to really go for it.
26265	5	a	"Like that other witch hunter movie, ""Hansel and Gretel: Witch Hunters,"" this is a film that is completely looney tunes, and it only half knows it."
26266	1	a	A highly unlikely blend of savage violence, farcical humor and impossible romantic yearning, acted out with sometimes awe-inspiring precision.
26267	6	a	Will Smith and a great cast are not enough to keep this from becoming a soaring disappointment in this summer's superhero movie sweepstakes.
26268	3	a	Weitz has a clear-eyed vision of the zeitgeist and tosses it up on the screen with a deadpan veracity that is as unflinching as it is hilarious
26269	5	a	When it's not forcing you to stifle a laugh, there are moments when the unwavering sincerity of the cast add up to some decent scenes.
26270	0	a	This movie is more than one joke or one idea. It's a thoroughly satisfying comedy -- and a respectable space adventure, as well.
26271	3	a	Hereafter unfolds with the patience of a good book, a factor likely to turn off more antsy audience members. Yet those who don't flinch at its meditative rhythms will find much to appreciate.
26272	9	a	There is not a shred of hope, light or even life in Mendes' fourth film.
26273	3	a	Though a classic rags to riches saga, this biopic of Loretta Lynn doesn't fall victim to cliches, and benefits immensely from the astonishingly authentic turn from Sissy Spacek, who does her own singing; even real-life singer Lynn liked the picture
26274	7	a	I don't mean to dismiss his films, which I enjoy, or cast aspersions on his character, but I've got to admit -- when Tarantino plays his own sordid parts, he gives me the creeps.
26275	0	a	What Spielberg has done in this Holocaust story is simply and forcefully place us there.
26276	7	a	This sanitized version of inner-city life deserves points for its game attempt to create an uplifting tale, but outside some flashy basketball sequences, it rarely comes to life or generates much believability.
26277	1	a	Like Hero, this one is almost nonstop action, and fans of martial-arts films will surely love it just as much.
26278	1	a	Nebraska is one of Payne's best films, a near-perfect amalgam of the acrid humor, great local color, and stirring resonances that run through his work.
26279	6	a	Summing up a complex human being in two hours is like an MTV spot about Nelson Mandela cut to a Kanye West track. We don't really get to know Sedgwick at all.
26280	6	a	Stick a fork in the Final Destination franchise - probably something that's been done in some variation to a poor slob in every one of the ongoing series. It's done.
26281	10	a	A flat, tedious and overlong experience that will drive away all but the most hardened Zombie fans.
26282	3	a	The action scenes are huge and excessively violent on a scale not seen since the closing scenes of Commando. At one point, in the absence of any buildings to detonate or ammunition depots to destroy, I think I saw an explosion explode.
26283	4	a	Beyond a few shining moments, Billy Lynn's Long Halftime Walk is a bit of a trudge.
26284	9	a	A dark pastiche of murky drug deals and menacing thugs sans the tongue-in-cheek humor and neon nights of television's crayola-washed classic.
26285	6	a	It's a movie possessed, in the end, not by the devil, just by errant ambition.
26286	1	a	Land's gruesomely creative zombie atrocities stretch an R rating's limits like a bloody tendon about to snap.
26287	4	a	Humid and overwrought, with Ricci working at fever pitch and Jackson bringing fire, brimstone and some passable blues licks to the equation, Black Snake Moan is no polite little indie thing, and certainly no formulaic studio exercise.
26288	1	a	Nail-biting until the end.
26289	4	a	"Vin Diesel and Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson square off in a movie at last. It's a cosmic event, like some freak planetary collision."
26290	2	a	Gripping rodeo film showing sympathy for the Native Americans living in need on the Pine Ridge Indian Reservation in South Dakota.
26291	8	a	The makers of the movie you're slogging through will spare no expense to demonstrate how much they hate us.
26292	3	a	Linney, in particular, is heartbreaking.
26293	2	a	[Turing is] a puzzle, yes, but to its credit, The Imitation Game doesn't pretend to solve him.
26294	9	a	A disaster from beginning to end. If you're going to Stay anywhere, Stay at home.
26295	6	a	The film consists mostly of action and romance, two things Liman does well in his comedies, but rather poorly here.
26296	4	a	But it has energy, it has a gonzo go for broke attitude and it also has a Cage willing to do just about anything to keep things interesting, three items many films would fall all over themselves to possess.
26297	5	a	It's all incredibly routine fare, borrowing as much from the old Doris Day and Rock Hudson comedies as from their numerous knockoffs.
26298	5	a	The radiation-altered members of the Fantastic Four don't show their humanity. Rather, the superpowered quartet is little more than a bland collection of four-color caricatures.
26299	3	a	The wonderfully expressive features on Bolt make him feel almost real and the movie has enough charm and humour to please both adults and children.
26300	6	a	'Mark Felt' certainly is not an awful movie. It simply has a feel of 'been there, done that.'
26301	1	a	Hang on and prepare to laugh continually.
26302	0	a	With an unforgettable opening sequence in which our hero flees through a trap-filled tunnel from a great ball of rock, Raiders Of The Lost Ark is a film which wastes no time and never lets go of our attention.
26303	2	a	No, it's not the best work of a studio known for much higher quality, but it's far from terrible. As they say: their heart is in the right place. [Full Review in Spanish] 
26304	3	a	The film is drowning in so much depraved gunk that subtleties are lost. The payoff is dandy anyway ...
26305	6	a	John Carter is arriving late to the party, after George Lucas had already pillaged the source material and squeezed it for every dollar it was worth. Stanton has created a sci-fi adventure that feels both old hat and sub-par.
26306	3	a	Ang Lee's latest dissection of the American dream is one of his most complex and even most deceptively subversive films.
26307	1	a	If you think the Star Wars prequels are a disease, then Serenity is the cure.
26308	0	a	A darkly comic Jeremiad whose time has come
26309	0	a	Bursting with humor, great acting and David O. Russell's abundant filmmaking talent, American Hustle is a joy to watch.
26310	2	a	The film has one of the best lines of the year, by Hopper, 'Zombies, man, they creep me out.'
26311	6	a	I was able to guess what would happen to most of the characters most of the time and come through perfectly.
26312	7	a	The saddles aren't blazing; they're damp.
26313	3	a	Tina Fey's funniest, most pointed big screen outing. 
26314	6	a	Who will make these arrests and when? It's hard to develop an intense involvement around the question, and heading toward the who-cares resolution are lots of scenes paced with maddening slowness.
26315	5	a	F illed with little but disappointment.
26316	3	a	The movie matches its subject with a beautifully appropriate intelligence, and is smartly structured, switching perspectives from Alice's self-preservation to her family members' dealings so imperceptibly that a decisive moment never arrives.
26317	2	a	Tommy Boy is a good belly laugh of a movie.
26318	6	a	"Cosmopolis,"" because of its allegiance to the book's mannered, offbeat language, feels like it never wakes up."
26319	5	a	Not just confusing, predictable and mis-sold as a feminist film, the calamity that is Jane Got A Gun is hobbled by the dullest of plots.
26320	3	a	It's challenging, artfully made work from Shults, requiring those electing to see it to relax some expectations as the movie endeavors to unnerve, not shock.
26321	8	a	This is the action movie of the year, maybe the best in several years. It is trying to be the next Bond-type franchise series and if the next one is anywhere near this good, it may succeed.
26322	5	a	The movie's biggest sin lies not in where it chooses to cast blame, but in its bungled attempt at manufacturing what I suppose you'd have to call an epiphany of excess.
26323	5	a	Handsome and sometimes creepy, but formulaic in the extreme.
26324	0	a	A piece of investigative reportage that is as compassionate as it is riveting.
26325	4	a	Romero finds creative ways to stage zombies feasting on flesh while tackling...gated communities, war profiteering, and entertainment as a weapon of mass distraction.
26326	3	a	Disney offers a delightfully affectionate, and surprisingly entertaining, parody of its own traditions.
26327	0	a	A provocative Holocaust drama saturated with tension and streaked with dark comedy.
26328	4	a	A strong, brutal look at the lure of drugs and its effect on young people as well as the cops out to stop it.
26329	4	a	Dreyfuss at his usual, amusing best
26330	5	a	Astro Boy may have many of the same parts as the source material, but as Dr. Tenma learns, trying to replicate something doesn't mean you end up with the same original.
26331	5	a	I am just about ready to write off movies in which people make bets about whether they will, or will not, fall in love.
26332	0	a	...ascetic, poetic, and prophetic.
26333	4	a	Loud, fast, derivative, and hypnotic...if there are two things that [Rob Zombie] is all about, it's horror movies and the art of the spectacle...campy and often funny
26334	7	a	The only thing saving Lake City from total ridiculousness is Spacek.
26335	3	a	No air quotes or winks at the audience, just a fresh, sweet story. And that's movie magic.
26336	3	a	It has a jamming B-picture buzz -- the kind of swift filmmaking and high spirits that have been missing from movies for a while.
26337	0	a	This Best Picture nominee is a beautifully filmed coming-of-age and coming-out story.
26338	4	a	It Comes at Night works best in the moments when it drills down into the social dynamics of the six survivors.
26339	7	a	It's a dreadful comedy that's only for diehard fans, critic apologists for such lame slapstick laced with sentimentality and the French.
26340	0	a	One of the toughest movies ever made, an uncompromising and frightening film that lays bare the inhuman conditions of the penal system in post-WWI Georgia.
26341	9	a	Generates little in the way of genuine terror or suspense.
26342	5	a	"Silver Linings Playbook"" is a Hollywood romantic comedy made to mask the horrific downside of mental illness while still giving the audience a little sense of superiority as they walk out of the cinema."
26343	3	a	You may not trust the facts in American Hustle but you can rely on it as one of this year's most aggressively entertaining films.
26344	4	a	It's still fascinating to get a glimpse of what athletes sacrifice to entertain us. It would have been considerably more fascinating if more of the people involved had seemed more human.
26345	0	a	[Jennifer Aniston's] exquisitely modulated and heartbreakingly understated performance is a revelation...easily one of the year's very best motion pictures.
26346	1	a	"Frantic and fresh, ""The Bourne Supremacy"" is a chic spy thriller that's even better than the original."
26347	2	a	An effective, naive and entertaining family movie, which should serve to introduce these endearing characters to those who haven't met them yet. [Full review in Spanish]
26348	6	a	Performances, plot and pacing are as mechanical as the hard-wired cast.
26349	9	a	Inflicting pain -- both on its characters and on hapless audience members -- seems to be the play of the day as far as this cesspool of a movie is concerned.
26350	4	a	A solid thriller, let down by the questionable decision to reveal the killer way too early. 
26351	6	a	It could've been much, much worse, but that doesn't necessarily mean it's any good. [Full review in Spanish]
26352	3	a	View this movie prepared, but definitely view it - for Theron's incredible performance and its important - if difficult - subject matter.
26353	3	a	It's reassuring, a little square, and you sense that Crowe, now a father and family man, is reaching out to a new, younger audience.
26354	3	a	A rather sad movie about the potential futility of doing good, or at least taking the difficult path, in a complicated world.
26355	4	a	It doesn't disappoint in the way of visceral thrills, and for a reportedly low-budget affair, the effects are pretty gruesome.
26356	1	a	Rather surprisingly... Midnight is an absolutely terrific film, fleet and brisk and as charming as it wants to be.
26357	6	a	Lacklustre design and rudimentary storytelling sink Astro Boy below the level of the recent hits of Pixar and DreamWorks.
26358	4	a	Watchable family sci-fi comedy with at least one hilarious and rather brilliant set-piece, but there's never really any sense of danger or jeopardy so it's not quite as exciting as it should have been.
26359	3	a	With its surprise ending and solid performances, this is one of the best films I have seen this year.
26360	5	a	Oh lordy, when the music stops, this movie needs a respirator.
26361	5	a	Despite the faultless execution, this ultimately unedifying story of pointless murder is ... hopelessly contrived.
26362	4	a	This comedy enables us to imagine the surprising ways in which a person can be transformed and set on a new path.
26363	0	a	Manages to be totally surreal yet totally approachable. Quite amazing.
26364	2	a	Serenity is going to have a hard time finding that right niche audience - outside of already existing Whedon/Firefly fans.
26365	2	a	[Casa de los Babys] wanders and stumbles in search of a center, but it finds plenty of goods along the way.
26366	3	a	A brilliant mix of comedy, drama and thrills. A real delight.
26367	3	a	An infectious appreciation for rock and roll lingers past the somewhat self-satisfied finale.
26368	5	a	Partly a schmaltzy, by-the-numbers romantic comedy, partly a shallow rumination on the emptiness of success -- and entirely soulless.
26369	6	a	It's enough to make one wonder if Jim Henson would have wanted things to take this course.
26370	4	a	Weirdly entertaining black comedy, that's not for all tastes.
26371	3	a	Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets is a solid work; it's effortlessly entertaining, generously faithful to J.K. Rowling's book -- and thrilling.
26372	4	a	There's no doubt that these people deserve each other. It's just a matter of sorting out which insufferable twit ends up with which.
26373	2	a	There's no doubting the film's commitment to a compassionate understanding of the complexities of the human heart.
26374	4	a	Even with the over-the-top acting of Dwayne Johnson and mind-numbing action sequences the film is actually watchable. 
26375	6	a	Squarely aimed at teens with little regard for anyone else...
26376	5	a	Tim and Eric's man-child characters, who look at the world with wide eyes and total trust, must be an acquired taste. And while fans of the television show may enjoy this movie, this reviewer did not.
26377	6	a	While Billy Lynn does not quite come together compellingly, you cannot fault Lee for having an ambitious vision and trying his darnedest to realise it.
26378	6	a	There's still an inexplicable, weird appeal to this not-so-charismatic killer and the movie series that just won't go away.
26379	5	a	If you're going to make a serious tearjerker, somebody's got to die. It's in the handbook of romantic platitudes.
26380	3	a	Holds up against the Coens' earlier genre masterpieces like Miller's Crossing and Fargo.
26381	0	a	A glimpse into the hell of our secret selves.
26382	6	a	The movie suffers from various technical difficulties -- like choppy editing and songs that get cut off mid-groove -- and in the end everything collapses in a heap.
26383	0	a	One of the great screen romances.
26384	3	a	This movie touched my soul, speaking a language that swept me back to my own childhood days.
26385	1	a	It's a western destined to outlive the pronouncements of its own death, because it knows that death is only the first stage in the life of legend.
26386	4	a	The wonder of the first movie is long gone, but a few thrills still remain.
26387	9	a	The Iditarod lasts for days - this just felt like it did.
26388	6	a	It's one thing to ask an audience to love a mechanical man, but quite another to love a mechanical performance.
26389	6	a	...a clever story ruined by a fight so poorly done it's laughable, and an unbelievably silly but graphic simulated sex scene in the finale.
26390	6	a	Everything in Jaws the Revenge is utterly expectable, which isn't a bright idea for a film relying on suspense and tension.
26391	4	a	A fun, fast and fantastically performed movie, and a pretty good interpretation of the comic
26392	5	a	This one's a nuts-and-bolts sci-fier that looks good but its dialogue is just terrible...
26393	0	a	Another instant classic.
26394	6	a	The fact that it remains watchable and enjoyable is a credit to its actors and its writer ...
26395	0	a	Ed Wood [is] a comedy of the ridiculous in which the ridiculous turns unexpectedly sublime. 
26396	3	a	Director Brian Henson, son of the late Jim Henson, has captured his father's vision and carries on the tradition better than anyone could have expected.
26397	0	a	Consistently hilarious.
26398	5	a	Every moment of The Skulls is just as idiotic as it sounds.
26399	10	a	Pre-packaged dog crap, a dumb movie made by dull-witted adults who clearly believe that just because some viewers currently reside at the lower end of the age spectrum, they don't deserve better.
26400	6	a	Handsome, but curiously cold, considering the emotional heat of Anglo-Irish matters. Fortunately, Liam Neeson commands almost every frame.
26401	4	a	The film is at its best in querulous, nervy scenes of cabined panic as the unknown lays shadowy siege.
26402	0	a	As in his gorgeous film Far From Heaven and TV series Mildred Pierce, filmmaker Todd Haynes tells a simple story with visual impact and thematic resonance.
26403	4	a	The toughness, tragedy and street slang built into it give it an aura of reality.
26404	4	a	Singer and his collaborators have decided to present what ought to be an exciting story with frankly comic solemnity.
26405	3	a	The film is probably best taken as an ultimately slight but still compelling Eastern that plays like a vintage Western about personal redemption.
26406	4	a	It's good enough to make a third Bourne movie a welcome possibility.
26407	4	a	As fine-tuned and moving a performance as Cumberbatch delivers - all the more impressive for being created from scratch, since no audio or video recordings of Turing exist - the film's Turing suffers an acute lack of an inner life.
26408	4	a	Private eye mysteries are so rare these days - indeed, the form is almost extinct on the big screen - that the film ends up feeling surprisingly fresh. 
26409	1	a	As a filmmaker, Allen has grappled with the temptations of repeating himself instead of forging a fresh path. You can feel that conflict here, and watching him work it out is exhilarating.
26410	5	a	Collins has a gamine-like quality reminiscent of a young Audrey Hepburn but her effervescent charm isn't enough to hide the chronic absurdities in the storyline.
26411	3	a	a disturbing and darkly revealing psychological thriller
26412	4	a	While it still falls short of becoming the classic fans so badly want it to be, the film is livelier and better overall than The Sorcerer's Stone, mostly because J.K. Rowling got all that tiresome exposition over with the first time out.
26413	2	a	Some of the scenery in the film, including a waterfall, is spectacular. The location shots are sumptuous. The acting is subtle and moving. This film has a lot going for it, but it is also very low-key, relatively non-dramatic and slow-moving.
26414	9	a	Any room in that freezer for this inadequate, inauthentic, indigestible film?
26415	3	a	Someone would have to be coldhearted to not smile watching Christopher Robin, whether it's from tapping your feet to the classic songs or soaking in the valuable life lessons
26416	5	a	If Jackie were Jack, this film would probably make TV, nothing more.
26417	7	a	The characters were as empty as the story.
26418	8	a	A big, dumb action fantasy that could be easily digestible and provide some rollicking Saturday matinee entertainment. Outside of the big and dumb part, it fails on almost every other level.
26419	3	a	"The World's End"" has the aura - and this might only be an attractive illusion - of something imagined whole, in a burst of inspiration, rather than as something labored over."
26420	4	a	Absorbing, well-crafted and appropriately tense, with a smart cast that raises it a notch above average.
26421	9	a	A cranium-pulverisingly dull and badly acted sci-fi action non-thriller.
26422	9	a	[A] lumbering, aptly titled hulk of a movie.
26423	3	a	The images are fresh and imaginative and yet perfectly believable, mixing the normal with the inconceivable,
26424	6	a	A tip of the hat to the good intentions; it coulda been a contender.
26425	7	a	Feste captures the heightened reality of performing before a massive crowd, when audience expectations and JumboTron screens can blow delicate emotions up to monstrous proportions. The problem is everything else.
26426	3	a	An unusually tough and daring film for both Willis and Moore.
26427	1	a	Apatow...makes the nicest movies to have ever been rated R.
26428	4	a	Land of the Dead is a perfectly adequate horror romp, but it's hard to imagine anyone remembering it five years from now.
26429	2	a	Better when it's resisting the need to be about something, the movie starts strong.
26430	4	a	A distinctly gallows take on contemporary financial mores, as one absurdly rich man's limo ride across town for a haircut functions as a state-of-the-nation discourse. 
26431	1	a	Actions don't have consequences, but that seems unimportant in this slice-of-real town USA drama.
26432	4	a	The most handsome funeral procession ever mounted--which is, in the end, better than feeling like you're the corpse lying inside the coffin.
26433	0	a	The Artist is a joyous and enchanting film.
26434	5	a	Screenplay writer John Patrick Shanley fails to shed any new light on the thorny problem of senseless urban violence.
26435	0	a	Freedom proves to be a very delicate value, and a very exacting reality. This is not a film to approach lightly. 
26436	7	a	If American Hustle has anything real to say, it's some minor bromide about greed and corruption. Ultimately, like its central characters, it's is all about 'tude; of that, it's got a ton.
26437	3	a	A thoughtful and ultimately deeply moving story about family ties, tradition, and acceptance.
26438	7	a	[Madonna] can barely muster even the rudiments of human expression.
26439	5	a	"Hitchcock once famously said that a good filmmaker should always ""always make the audience suffer as much as possible."" I don't think he meant the kind of suffering ""Hitchcock"" inflicts on its audience."
26440	4	a	Mostly ponderous, despite the unceasingly beautiful imagery.
26441	2	a	An amazingly powerful piece of news journalism.
26442	5	a	Forster never really mines the actor or the heavily stitched-together screenplay for more than mannered cliche.
26443	4	a	"Beresford hasn't usually allowed himself to become this corny. This new film appears calculated to do two things: make everyone cry and maximise its appeal to those red-blooded, childlike Americans who think ""freedom"" is a US concept."
26444	6	a	Great, good for her, Theron's performance here easily one for the ages. Too bad the movie it's given in doesn't deserve it, Monster a monstrously disappointing mess.
26445	6	a	There are contrivances of convenience in Secret Window, all of which keep the movie from ending too soon.
26446	6	a	The film's hit-to-miss joke ratio isn't as favorable as you might wish.
26447	2	a	Steinfeld is outstanding. Good thing, too, because in lesser hands Nadine would be insufferable.
26448	5	a	Paper Towns is a breathtakingly vanilla adaptation of another soppy novel from The Fault in Our Stars author John Green.
26449	4	a	It's undeniably riveting.
26450	0	a	This is not a melodramatic movie - there's not so much as a fistfight, and the ending will be too quiet for some - yet at times its sadness is almost overwhelming.
26451	4	a	The suspense is restrained and subtle, with some genuinely delicious scares.
26452	2	a	A gripping film...even more effective for being a somewhat muted, well-modulated one, characterized by resigned grief rather than anger.
26453	2	a	Derek Cianfrance can't quite thread the needle between John Cassavetes and David Lean, but it's fun to watch him try.
26454	3	a	Turing is a tougher role to play than it might once have been, but Cumberbatch burrows beneath the surface to reveal someone with machine-like logic locked in a soulful struggle against an inhuman society.
26455	0	a	It's not enough for a movie to have a Black cast for it to be good, it must have good writing, engaging stories and impassioned actors. This film has all three.
26456	7	a	I doubt many people are going to find it funny without some sort of chemical help.
26457	5	a	Over-familiar and industrial, a factory film made because a recycled script, minimal budget, a location, a grab-bag cast and some armored trucks were available.
26458	3	a	An amazing mood piece that captures the characters' inner turmoil, confusion, restlessness and the strange, surreal surroundings that are the cause for their discord.
26459	0	a	Killer Joe is a white-hot fever dream of a film. A toxic swill of sex and violence, Joe is mordantly funny, tantalizing and, ultimately, shocking.
26460	5	a	The film wastes the talents of such funny people as Lewis Black and Teri Garr, as well as cast members from TV's Arrested Development, The Office, The Daily Show and Kids in the Hall.
26461	4	a	Quite a bit of the film's political satire is surprisingly smart and amusing.
26462	0	a	Both a surefire crowdpleaser and a magnificent piece of film-making.
26463	1	a	Cumberbatch does what he can to fill in the blanks and he is the real thing here -- all shyness, rudeness, acid comments, pathos, dazzling intellect and aching melancholy, while suppressing his velvety star charisma.
26464	3	a	One of the smartest, most nail-biting thrillers in EON's
26465	3	a	By the time we get to this Phoenix, it looks like numerous days of scorching sun and blasts of sand are pretty much good for the complexion. 
26466	5	a	'Where could all this be going? you might wonder. Sadly, the answer is 'Nowhere.'
26467	6	a	"Crimson Peak"" is frustrating from nearly every angle. It lets the audience race ahead of the reveals, while struggling to put all that tantalizingly rich atmosphere to effective narrative use."
26468	6	a	Taking Woodstock fails to immerse us in the visceral feeling of being there.
26469	1	a	A summer pleasure.
26470	0	a	It's Sienna Miller's star that shines brightest in this heartbreaking cautionary tale.
26471	4	a	"Radha Mitchell is the reason to sit through this overblown Grand Guignol entertainment from the director of the similarly overblown ""Brotherhood of the Wolf."
26472	4	a	Smith charms his way through piled-on platitudes and social faux-pas' with his groove intact.
26473	3	a	This witty Korean satire dissects men's self-absorption, insecure sexuality, and fear of intimacy with critical honesty, wry humor, and delectable irony.
26474	4	a	How about The Okay Quartet?
26475	4	a	Joe Eszterhas shamelessly reworks ideas and themes he had earlier exploited in films such as Jagged Edge and Music Box, but the sheer overheated nature of Verhoeven's direction makes this extremely watchable.
26476	8	a	The problem is that this story and all its supposed shock value is just plain boring.
26477	3	a	Vera Farmiga gives an astonishing performance in this complex chronicle of a drug addict who goes through rehab, yearning for redemption, but her experience is not tidy and there's no neat conclusion.
26478	4	a	Ultimately, we are welcome to marvel at A Most Wanted Man, but it'd be nearly impossible to revel in it.
26479	0	a	This is a long sweet breath of fresh air in the action genre...
26480	4	a	Actor Vincent Gallo makes a feature directing debut with this bizarre, self-indulgent tale of a troubled guy, played by him in a narcissistic mode, who has never reconciled his unhappy childhood.
26481	3	a	Fab animation from Wallace and Gromit creator.
26482	10	a	Memo to Hollywood: Find another use for Keanu Reeves.
26483	3	a	It loses its way, but the first half is fresh and funny enough to make it worthwhile.
26484	3	a	The film is an exercise in improbable contrasts. The more extreme the actions of the characters, the more contained and fastidious the director's technique.
26485	7	a	Even the full monty as promised, was not delivered.
26486	5	a	The only question left is who will despise The Cloverfield Paradox more; fans of the franchise or those turning it on seeking some sci-fi escapism
26487	5	a	Laughter comes from the movie's absurdity, not its comedy.
26488	2	a	Contracted does for sex what Jaws did for beaches, let's just leave it at that.
26489	2	a	Don't leave your brain at the door like other critics are suggesting, just hide it behind a beer helmet and gleefully guzzle Teh Stoopid away.
26490	3	a	Colvin was a force of nature, and it's no surprise that she's now lauded cinematically. Hers is a story that begged to be told, because to witness this level of courage, integrity, passion, authenticity, and dedication is to empower yourself.
26491	7	a	Was Wrong Turn directed by the kind of in-bred mountain men depicted in the film? The opening credits is the only device that drive the plot -- the rest is simply a squeal-inducing hunt movie.
26492	0	a	Welles not only inspired the bright young men with whom he collaborated, he shamed the Hollywood hacks into a realization of just how deeply they had betrayed their talent.
26493	0	a	Bergman's often heralded masterpiece of European cinema is more than a formal delight. It's funny, touching, and very, very emotional.
26494	5	a	After five films consisting mostly of sinister establishing shots of screws unscrewing themselves, I'm ready to cry 'no mas.' 
26495	3	a	Click to read review
26496	5	a	The problem with Albert Nobbs though is that it's hard to believe that the people around the heroine haven't figured her out yet. Even with prosthetics, Close isn't all that convincing as a man.
26497	5	a	his time-travel romcom wastes lead Aubrey Plaza and dithers until its geek-pandering finale.
26498	6	a	Treasure Planet is a handsome picture, with lots of nifty borrowings from the Star Wars galaxy, but it's never particularly compelling as a story or as a vehicle for emotions.
26499	3	a	A wonderfully quirky character-driven drama about friendship, sexual desire, and being a true gentleman. 
26500	10	a	You want real terror? If this second outing proves profitable, we'll be looking at Yet Again I Recall the Summer Before the Summer Before Last. Now that's scary.
26501	1	a	A key part of the film's success is that Penny, the object of Bolt's devotion, really is a sweet kid who loves her furry co-star.
26502	3	a	Droll and poignant, if a little overextended.
26503	2	a	"It takes a while to get going and is about half an hour too long, but ""John Carter"" has some spectacular visuals and well-staged action scenes. "
26504	4	a	A winning madcap comedy...
26505	6	a	"Paris Can Wait"" is a modest, genteel piece of cinematic escapism, a silky testament to sensuality as impeccably tasteful as it is utterly undemanding."
26506	6	a	The rules of good screenwriting are mostly broken, though Jamie Foxx's smash-and-grab charisma remains intact.
26507	4	a	The Good Son has a handsome, scenic look that sustains interest, and a suspenseful ending that is quite literally gripping.
26508	3	a	[The screenplay is] good enough to keep things moving, to supply Smith with one- liners and to provide an excuse for the compelling backdrop.
26509	8	a	A truly disgraceful outing that amounts to little more than an unbelievable Steven Seagal self-love fest.
26510	7	a	This slapdash comedy barely coughs up more than a couple of funny scenes as the story moves in predictable fits and starts before sputtering out of fuel half way through.
26511	3	a	Crank High Voltage delivers everything it promises -- if it were a politician, it'd have my vote.
26512	3	a	Bright Star is at once sublimely swoonsome yet marvellously down to Earth.
26513	5	a	The images are cluttered and murky, the comic rhythms falter, and the adult humans in the cast, including Lisa Kudrow and Don Cheadle, seem resigned to being upstaged by the kids and dogs.
26514	3	a	"For all the talk of ""morals"" in the American cultural dialogue, stoner Ben says the only thing that really should matter: ""I just want to do right by you."
26515	4	a	Watching The Prestige is like observing a magic act where the magician's sleight-of-hand isn't deft enough. The trick almost works, but not quite.
26516	4	a	Perhaps Almodovar and film noir simply don't mix.
26517	8	a	...an incredibly entertaining, if derivative around the edges, family-friendly fantasy flick...
26518	8	a	"National Security"" is another in a string of indistinguishable dumb action comedies that would all run together in the mind of anyone unfortunate enough to watch them if they were not so instantly forgettable."
26519	1	a	It is at once artful and unpretentious, sophisticated and completely accessible, sure of its own authority and generous toward characters and audience alike -- a movie whose intended public is the human race.
26520	6	a	Messy but periodically funny.
26521	6	a	The same plot the first four versions had but this time with a more inventive way of killing and some needed humor.
26522	2	a	The film's charms and strengths are undeniable... but none of it is enhanced by the bloated last hour, or the logy overall pace.
26523	5	a	This straightforward schematic biopic never talks to me.
26524	3	a	Oh, did you want to see a Jennifer Aniston romantic comedy? Life isn't always about Hollywood expectations; let's cut Jennifer some slack and enjoy her doing good work.
26525	2	a	Does capture the true spirit of the adventure.
26526	2	a	Fast-paced and visually breathtaking.
26527	1	a	A wild and visually stunning quest through a fantasy world all done with the noble spirit of courage and goodwill.
26528	5	a	Tom Hanks confuses 'likeable and nice' with 'boring and pointless.'
26529	1	a	Featuring some of the best writing and acting on screen all year, The Savages shouldn't be missed.
26530	3	a	"Like the speedy vehicles that can be seen throughout the film, ""Spy Kids"" moves at an agreeably quick pace, never letting up for such petty things as catching your breath."
26531	0	a	A film that will enthrall the whole family.
26532	4	a	Black Nativity is ungainly in execution, yet still infused with enough passion and reverence for Hughes' original work to be more success than failure.
26533	3	a	"It's been a while since we've had a rousing, inspirational film about rectifying social injustices a la ""Norma Rae"" or ""Philadelphia."
26534	4	a	The Ring doesn't have the wiliness or conviction to exploit either a single mother's guilt over child neglect or our collective queasiness over potential bad seeds. It merely alternates these themes and toys with them.
26535	4	a	The daring Brad Furman is still looking for his style among Heisenberg and Narcos. [Full review in Spanish]
26536	5	a	Drama about Deep Throat, the whistle-blower who wanted to save American democracy.
26537	3	a	You cannot deny the power of what both Ronan and Robbie bring to this elaborate and visually operatic drama.
26538	5	a	In reality Man Of The Year is one half The Robin Williams Show and one half dour thriller involving a rigged election and the evils of electronic voting machines. The second half nearly obliterates the film.
26539	1	a	This superb documentary about the Catholic Church's worst pedophile scandal is in many ways far scarier than any fiction.
26540	0	a	... The best non-Pixar animated movie in recent memory ...
26541	5	a	A turgid lump of narrative and not much else.
26542	6	a	A lot of sexy stuff wrapped in an obvious morality tale with some philosophical hooey and clunky symbols thrown in to justify the cheap, but undeniable, thrills.
26543	1	a	An especially fun movie and a rare instance of a sequel that not only equals, but even betters, its original.
26544	5	a	Sienna Miller brings bright eyes and shapeshifting commitment to a script that doesn't always deserve it.
26545	3	a	Call Me by Your Name is a perfect, lazy, worry-free day, practically devoid of any real-world concerns and absolutely dripping with intellectual and artistic stimulation, and all manner of sexual enticement.
26546	3	a	Demented. And deep. 
26547	3	a	This is magnetic, beautiful stuff.
26548	3	a	Hilarious, wistful and eventually bizarre ...
26549	2	a	As dreary as the film is, it draws you in with its captivating, yet sober, cinematography and the solid performances of the cast.
26550	2	a	sweet, not altogether satisfying variation on the fantasy-becomes-reality conceit he used in his Depression-era The Purple Rose of Cairo.
26551	5	a	A manic Melissa McCarthy does her darndest to save this overly familiar comedy. Alas, it isn't enough.
26552	6	a	Just as often the film is as monotonous and despair-inducing as three hours on an airplane with nothing to read but the in-flight magazine.
26553	3	a	Hugely enjoyable and cleverly written, this is an impressively directed, thought-provoking comedy-drama with a pair of pitch-perfect performances from David Duchovny and Demi Moore.
26554	6	a	The wonderful character actors in the original ... are succeeded by a fairly anonymous bunch.
26555	5	a	This anthropomorphic Disneyfication -- presumably intended to give youngsters something to relate to -- is made worse by the film's elementary dialogue and Queen Latifah's crass 'n' brash delivery.
26556	4	a	Robert Downey Jr. and Jamie Foxx are highly convincing. Problem is, the film lets them down. It is not as powerful or moving as it could -- and should -- have been.
26557	3	a	Pure magic.
26558	5	a	The structure doesn't work and the various directorial flourishes can't disguise the fact that nothing really happens, plot-wise.
26559	1	a	Of the four absurdist comedies the director made towards the end of his life, this is the best and most accessible.
26560	3	a	...the emphasis is on comedy and lightness highlighted by award quality performance, especially by Lawrence and Adams, who appears in extremely revealing clothes throughout.
26561	6	a	Tries to justify its ugly sadism through some very black comedy and a revival of the Vietnam-era cultural politics of the original: The cannibal family represents an establishment that turns young people into not just cannon fodder but literal fodder.
26562	1	a	It's Mr. Bertolucci's most rewarding, most invigorating film since Last Tango.
26563	1	a	An equal-opportunity slapdown to those on the Liberal Left, Self-Righteous Right and anyone in between.
26564	5	a	The melding of a modern family saga with the Nativity is too awkward and hectic to let audiences sit back and appreciate some powerhouse singers and music.
26565	4	a	This is really two movies in one -- an exemplary political satire and an average thriller, tied together with romantically shopworn president-as-an-average-Joe tropes from Dave and The American President.
26566	7	a	It's pretty to look at, but so low-voltage and instantly forgettable that it's hardly worth anyone's time.
26567	3	a	A couple of the sketches in the middle drag lifelessly, but the best ones -- usually revolving around a sharp satire of celebrity -- buoy the whole.
26568	8	a	A sleek, stylistic adventure thriller, a fun-filled popcorn picture that will not self-destruct.
26569	5	a	...a hopelessly frivolous waste of time.
26570	3	a	A truly captivating, pertinent piece of cinema.
26571	10	a	Utter rubbish--loud, chaotic and ugly...Eviction would seem the only perfect solution.
26572	4	a	Handsome production design and sweeping battle vistas lend a touch of class, with Chan directing the action scenes with trademark brio.
26573	4	a	Love Ranch proves to be a provocative, highly entertaining and surprisingly touching peek into a unique world movies don't often explore.
26574	1	a	Beautiful and slow and never boring -- just a gentle, hazy sleepwalk through a time in life that never really feels fully settled or awake.
26575	1	a	A film of abundant visual beauty through whose heart blows a chill valedictory breeze.
26576	2	a	Valkyrie offers something to filmgoers weary of excessive pretense, but not quite desperate enough to watch Jim Carrey flop around on the ground.
26577	4	a	An anthology of curiosities, some more curious than others...
26578	0	a	The whole franchise has been given a new shot of vitality and vigor.
26579	4	a	'Identity Thief' is not a great movie. But it is a great vehicle for two terrific actors who drape themselves in material perfectly tailored to them.
26580	9	a	...a bottom-of-the-barrel children's movie...
26581	6	a	Considering the naughty subject matter, Middle Men is a shockingly dull affair.
26582	6	a	The truest thing to say about Miami Vice is that it's an OK picture with some superb things in it.
26583	1	a	Creepy, funny, poignant, and stunningly imaginative and original.
26584	0	a	Could we be ready to stop snickering about it and admit to its status as a modern classic?
26585	3	a	A must-see for movie buffs curious about a new technology.
26586	6	a	A pointless satire on high school coeds acting bitchy and hanging out in cliques.
26587	9	a	not the worst example of the genre. Nor is it even the worst of its own particular sub-genre, the Sarah Jessica Parker chick-flick. This should not, however, be misconstrued as an endorsement
26588	9	a	Director Nolan's fascination with magic and with tricks in general comes through without question, but he approaches the subject with a seriousness that soon turns grim.
26589	2	a	It's an original, and a real gem.
26590	3	a	Most of Hancock's faults can be forgiven because Will Smith creates a quintessentially American hero: flawed, frayed, but always sacrificing for the sake of others.
26591	5	a	Sienna Miller embodies Edie Sedgwick with a thoroughly convincing highwire act to match Guy Pierce's incarnation of Andy Warhol in Hickenlooper's perfunctory biopic.
26592	2	a	Good-natured and fun.
26593	9	a	Graffiti Bridge is essentially a series of music videos strung together uncomfortably with awkward dialogue and stiff acting. 
26594	6	a	It's hard to concentrate on normal points of movie criticism when you're trying to keep your lunch down.
26595	0	a	Cholodenko has an extraordinarily assured hand; the subtle and detailed touches with which she sets each scene force you to take her characters seriously, no matter how superficial and contrived their plight.
26596	4	a	rises above plot holes and stilted dialogue just enough to be a fun Sunday afternoon Matinee
26597	9	a	Beyond stupid.
26598	4	a	"Director Andrew Stanton has a strong sense of what makes ""adventure"" adventurous, helping John Carter encapsulate everything about a great time at the movies."
26599	5	a	It should have been great but it just doesn't have enough magic dust to fly.
26600	5	a	Humor leans heavily on elementary pop-culture parody, a particularly tiresome and parasitic form of humor that depends on an audience of smirking know-it-alls who can be trusted to snicker whenever they get the reference.
26601	5	a	Depp opens the movie by looking into the camera and announcing, You will not like me now, and you will like me even less as we go on. That turns out to be true.
26602	1	a	Sensation is essential to [Guillermo del Toro's] aesthetic, and Crimson Peak is a film that's all about engaging the senses.
26603	3	a	"B.B. King. Bill Withers. Miriam Makeba. Celia Cruz. And James Brown, earning every inch of the title, ""Godfather of Soul,"" who all by himself probably deforested a few acres around Kinshasa with the volcanic blast of his set."
26604	1	a	while their fictional family fabric resembles that of March of the Penguins, Arctic Tale is the more gripping, moving film by far.
26605	3	a	The movie's space battle...have a swiftness, an electricity and, most importantly, a clarity lacking in the works of other so-called sci-fi masters.
26606	4	a	a predictable and genial romantic comedy that's not very romantic and never really all that funn
26607	1	a	Best of all, this is a story that's actually about something.
26608	7	a	O brother Cianfrance, where art thou? Maybe next time.
26609	5	a	Award-winning director Ang Lee assembles a collection of effective scenes in this serious effort, but it also several moments that don't really work; in the end, it doesn't seem to add up to much. 
26610	3	a	Steinfeld attacks the role with a sly ferocity and a fearless streak of self-deprecation - you either know a Nadine, or you are Nadine.
26611	3	a	What's interesting about the movie is that, while it's only moderately funny, it's extremely amusing...It held my interest throughout.
26612	3	a	If Into the Wild falls short of giving McCandless an indelible cinematic life, the film gets under your skin anyway. It doesn't feel improvised, exactly, but it does feel inhabited.
26613	3	a	It's essentially a weepie, and as such it's a winner: nicely acted, fairly restrained in its emotionalism and bringing us a curious true story.
26614	3	a	Unpretentious and efficient.
26615	5	a	Not Easily Broken is a marriage-in-crisis melodrama baked from the Tyler Perry recipe.
26616	3	a	In the end what makes Cold Creek Manor work is Figgis' pacing and attention to detail.
26617	3	a	Without Limits is an admirable departure from the norm, but its greatest strength doubles as an undermining weakness.
26618	3	a	The Light Between Oceans is completely engaging and it's heartbreaking, though not so heartbreaking, Mr. Cianfrance seems to suggest, as the simple passage of time.
26619	2	a	The music is truly the thing in Songcatcher and it's awesome, haunting stuff.
26620	3	a	It brings to mind the bookish charms of undervalued Disney cartoons like The Rescuers and The Black Cauldron.
26621	2	a	Trying to address important and serious social issues in this violent world rather than just creating something sensationalistic or exploitative gives Elite Squad an edge over normal police thrillers.
26622	9	a	It has all the philosophical depth of a greetings card message but it's underscored with a nasty little edge of misogyny.
26623	3	a	Pavan Moondi mines hilarious comedy from this tale of doofuses in oddball situations.
26624	4	a	As the film eschews self-importance, it engages more directly and universally, if only in a rudimentary fashion that fails in terms of overall staying power.
26625	9	a	A meandering contemplation on teen angst but with nothing new or interesting to say about it.
26626	3	a	A classic. Funny, great special effects and a cultural phenomenon.
26627	3	a	"Who knew that the best place to put Vin Diesel would be between the Rock and a hard place? The spot has never been tighter, or righter, and the testosterone never higher than in the hot jacking action of ""Fast Five."
26628	4	a	Any of these musicians deserves a Walk the Line or Coal Miner's Daughter-type biopic of their own; perhaps this flawed but enjoyable movie is the first step toward that.
26629	9	a	Despite some rather surprisingly good acting by some of the most unlikely of cast members, the film's directing and editing style ultimately ruin Alpha Dog.
26630	9	a	Almost astonishing in its thinly plotted, shamelessly derivative amateurishness.
26631	3	a	It's a clever variation on the buddy cop picture, with Jackie Chan showing both his comic chops and his martial arts skills, and Owen Wilson doing what he does best-playing a laid-back, chick-magnet California surfer dude.
26632	8	a	Leave this one for the dogs.
26633	4	a	It's an A-grade cast all right, but there's no escaping that this is a B-movie.
26634	3	a	[A] wonderfully mad odyssey of a movie, in which a man sets out to find his biological parents and winds up meeting more weirdos than Alice found down the rabbit hole.
26635	3	a	... grim but striking ... Still, Fincher's remake is not up to the Swedish adaptation, which was creepier and more exhilarating, especially as the Old School/New School investigatory methods kicked in. 
26636	4	a	The techno thriller is more boring than thrilling.
26637	4	a	A restrained film that has its entertaining moments.
26638	9	a	It doesn't help that Zellweger has become so hard to like, horribly smug and pious when things are going right, abjectly hysterical when she sees the error of her ways.
26639	6	a	I'm tired of teens talking about make-up and making out. A lesbian twist to an otherwise standard story just isn't enough to make it compelling.
26640	0	a	An overdue tribute to a revered icon and to some unsung foot soldiers who played a critical role at a seminal moment in the courageous African-American struggle for freedom and equality.
26641	3	a	Don't be fooled by the soft-core poster; this haunting tale of pain and memory is as good as they come.
26642	5	a	The worst thing, though, is that there's already a masterpiece of a film telling this story from the other side, Alan J Pakula's All The President's Men.
26643	6	a	'Fantastic Four' could have been hot, but in the hands of some studio blockheads, the premise is stretched so thin that it disappears.
26644	2	a	Valkyrie, as field-commanded by director Bryan Singer, succeeds on its own terms as a handsome hybrid of conspiracy thriller and history lesson, of Mission: Impossible and The Day of the Jackal.
26645	4	a	Thanks to the combined charm of the leads, this remains a most agreeable cinematic portrait.
26646	5	a	Ultimately, the reason that The Soloist fails is because the writer and the director have been bamboozled by the seriousness of the subject matter.
26647	0	a	So sharply written that it cuts, the third movie from award-winning playwright Martin McDonagh is a dramedy that starts with cleverness and wit, then opens up into something truthfully human. 
26648	1	a	This is about two people who didn't know what their lives were until they met each other, then scrambling, in their muted, buttoned-up way, to figure out what happens next. Haynes loves them so much that he believes they can. You will too.
26649	1	a	Blue Streak is a decent action flick packed with laughs.
26650	1	a	Teller is a knockout. He nails the hometown hero's accent, fighting style and goofball charm.
26651	3	a	If Matchstick Men isn't the classic con The Sting was, it still empties our pockets with the fast hands of a master.
26652	4	a	Law delivers unflinching, unanswerable truth. 
26653	6	a	The premise is overshadowed by the uberviolence of the Clericks as this becomes just another kung-fu sci-fi movie with silly action sequences.
26654	0	a	a masterpiece
26655	1	a	Counterbalancing the energy vacuum that is Cruise is the good news that this is also a Bryan Singer movie.
26656	3	a	Fincher's chilly, precision filmmaking knows how to tease, while still looking head-on into the abyss.
26657	0	a	Jaws remains, decades later, a near perfect film.
26658	0	a	Enjoyment derived from tension and fear, interspersed with brief breathers to allow nerve-relieving chuckles and smiles.
26659	7	a	Perhaps the blandest movie ever, directed so squarely down the middle of the road that helmer Donald Petrie might as well be painting yellow lines.
26660	5	a	Bening is good as Grahame, but it has practically become an annual ritual for her to excel in something forgettable.
26661	4	a	A staggeringly inane B-grade monster movie that doesn't pretend to be anything but a staggeringly inane B-grade monster movie and in fact so embraces its staggering B-grade inanity that it achieves a kind of elevated pop-cultural integrity.
26662	2	a	A perfectly likeable romantic comedy, containing not a single unforeseeable plot twist but featuring a good deal of witty dialogue and amusing interaction between the lead characters.
26663	1	a	Gyllenhaal is great as a troubled soul, but it's Aniston who pulls out everything un-Rachel-like for a performance that'll leave most amazed and many shocked.
26664	0	a	It's hard to believe this is writer-director Danis Tanovic's first feature fiction film.
26665	6	a	Fact and fiction intermingle in Paper Heart, but discovering where the line is drawn is the tricky part.
26666	5	a	Awfully disappointing coming from the director of Swingers and Go.
26667	1	a	The left testicle certainly gets it where it hurts, but the right is just centimeters away and is skewed so perfectly that they may not even recognize it.
26668	1	a	One of Hitchcock's more charming efforts.
26669	4	a	It's a movie that wears the trappings of the countercultural movement like bunting, yet is essentially mild-mannered and rather conventional.
26670	3	a	... it seems uncharitable to deny poor Jane Austen this chaste, hypothetical affair
26671	3	a	Awesome. Truly.
26672	4	a	A genuine guilty pleasure.
26673	1	a	A sure-footed thrill ride with more suspense and spine-tingling scares than a Tom Cruise publicity junket.
26674	0	a	This magnificent film represents the best work the Coen Brothers have done since Fargo. Like that classic this is a cold-blooded thriller with a darkly humorous edge. 
26675	0	a	What a supremely stylish and watchable picture it is.
26676	6	a	Fey can't save this disjointed, war comedy.
26677	4	a	This mindless mayhem preys on contemporary angst and uncertainty.
26678	3	a	It is not easy to walk that tightrope between clever, witty, insightful humor and bawdy farce, but Apatow seems to walk it with ease.
26679	3	a	We Have a Pope is a film concerned deeply with how religious doctrine stresses a disconnect from human experience and, by extension, the very notion of humanism.
26680	2	a	There are no easy answers in dealing with aging and dying parents, and Jenkins doesn't try to give us one.
26681	0	a	No Country for Old Men is the first movie I've seen in a very long while that deserves to be called a masterpiece. It's such a stunning achievement in storytelling.
26682	5	a	Who needs a story that makes sense when it's only camp that you're after?
26683	3	a	Somehow this is fun -- a result of a unique synergy between Cage and Herzog.
26684	3	a	Great Bond. Lousy title.
26685	6	a	Hitchcock is a stab in the dark. The film gets the suspense part of Alfred Hitchcock right, but for the wrong reasons.
26686	1	a	Cate Blanchett may well be on her way to a third Oscar, and it would not be undeserved. Her Carol is assured, but her consequences are greater, as is the range of emotion Blanchett displays.
26687	4	a	Cameron's self-importance turns Ghosts of the Abyss into an interesting ride with a tour guide you wish would sit down and shut up.
26688	4	a	The footage from the dives shows perfectly preserved details from the inside of the ship.
26689	6	a	Everything is beautiful -- even the squalor of poverty, the suffering of war. And nothing, ever, is revealed.
26690	5	a	Barnyard isn't a complete waste of time, it's just too familiar.
26691	0	a	Document?o excepcional que explora as mazelas da sociedade e do sistema judicial brasileiros. Retrato acurado de um Brasil desesperado, o filme nos leva a questionar quem s?as verdadeiras v?mas da viol?ia que impera no pa?
26692	1	a	As rich in ideas as it is in fine acting, Los Babys is another smart movie from a smart man who will likely never make a blockbuster.
26693	4	a	Alicia and Deanna's journey toward friendship, or at least a truer understanding, is moving.
26694	6	a	It's not perfect, but it is a wild 'n' crazy road trip on the lighter side of a topic that, as a lot of folks have discovered, is no laughing matter. 
26695	6	a	Fleder attempts...to puff this picture up with quasi-intellectual hot air. But the truth is, Don't Say a Word is the kind of movie Hollywood makes on auto-pilot...
26696	2	a	Carefully crafted, notably in its deft dramatic structuring, and has become timely in a way its maker could never have anticipated.
26697	6	a	It's a strain to care about Pat, and it's impossible to believe in his world.
26698	4	a	Does it work? Yes, if you like Rogen, but if you don't you'll feel that Gondry has fiddled too much with the original by giving his star full rein.
26699	6	a	The director, Pete Travis, is a pulse-pounding technological showman whose high-strung, quick-cut style might be described as JFK meets Paul Greengrass meets Jerry Bruckheimer. That said, it's not the plot that thickens -- it's the pulp.
26700	8	a	The verdict: Two bodies and hardly a laugh between them.
26701	5	a	An overlong bore that either mistakenly thinks it's something more than a humdrum romance or has incorporated a variety of pretentions as window-dressing.
26702	3	a	A compelling journey into the depths of hell on earth.
26703	3	a	For anyone looking to add a single Hepburn/Tracy movie to their collection, this is the one.
26704	4	a	"An oddly effective little charmer, ""Safety Not Guaranteed"" ekes out a victory over so much of its indie-darling competition simply by following through on the ideas it introduces."
26705	1	a	You'll go a long way to find anything playing right now that's as downright peculiar as Werner Herzog's The Bad Lieutenant: Port of Call -- New Orelans.
26706	3	a	"Gradually, you're reminded why Brooks gave us so much good television over the years, in addition to his better movies, chief among them ""Broadcast News."
26707	3	a	Easily Mike Myers' best movie.
26708	4	a	It becomes exactly what it had avoided: a sports story that just happens to feature tragedy.
26709	6	a	A well-played if too-familiar story of oppression and injustice.
26710	0	a	Reign of Fire will likely reign over the box office.
26711	2	a	A neo-western as... bitter as a Nick Cave song. [Full review in Spanish]
26712	3	a	Even if it's exaggerated and improbable on every level, the film still manages to grab our eye with its spectacular artistry, and our heart with its simple tale of yearning.
26713	9	a	It is depressing to reflect on the wealth of talent that conspired to make this inert and listless movie.
26714	3	a	It's frustrating but the movie works thanks to Cumberbatch's excellent performance and the eternally powerful image of the tortured hero.
26715	4	a	Van Sant opens a window onto the teen life ..., but the insights have less depth than a skateboard wheel's imprint.
26716	8	a	If your idea of a good time is laughing with repulsion at a humpbacked Romanian nympho with a torture-loving midget dad, or tittering every time a bong appears, a darkened theater awaits you.
26717	1	a	A pleasure.
26718	5	a	Unlike Hitchcock's work, it fades from memory almost immediately.
26719	4	a	The movie has just enough funny lines and amusing casting choices to make it all go down pleasantly, and Hanks' sweetly brash charisma could fill an entire multiplex of movies and then some.
26720	3	a	[T]he movie works off its trio of delicious star performances, its sumptuous production values, its sprawling sets of old Kyoto, its sweeping John Williams score and haunting cello solos by Yo-Yo Ma.
26721	1	a	An exhilarating, sweeping epic that begs to be seen on the largest possible screen.
26722	1	a	"Resembling yard sculptures in a trailer park, where trash becomes art, ""Killer Joe"" is a Picasso signed with a branding iron."
26723	8	a	One of the funniest movies I've seen all year.
26724	3	a	No kiddie movie would be complete without spazzy supporting characters, booger jokes, yucky food and toilet humor; Diary delivers them in abundance without straying too far from Disney Channel wholesomeness.
26725	6	a	Offers some entertaining punches, but ultimately goes down on a split decision.
26726	10	a	Watching Wonderland is like being trapped in a reeking shed under a naked light bulb, morosely reading old tabloids that have lost their shock value.
26727	3	a	Part revisionist Western, part social commentary, and part hallucinatory dream.
26728	0	a	In a word: Incredible.
26729	4	a	Colin Farrell as an amoral Russian gangster, Ed Harris as an enigmatic American and Saoirse Ronan as a vulnerable young woman all make enough of an impression to make us wish we knew more about them.
26730	4	a	Adapted from the Jonathan Ames novel, the film is too precious around the edges, but it gets somewhere.
26731	1	a	Ultra-stylish and handsomely acted by Bale and Jackman, The Prestige is a workout for your mind and entertainment of the highest order.
26732	6	a	If you are into extremes this ultra-violent blood feast is probably just your ticket.
26733	4	a	A notable debut for director Monica Stambrini.
26734	3	a	Skyfall is a brilliant Bond.
26735	2	a	It's a valentine to the cinema that comes from the heart.
26736	5	a	[Depp's] readings and body language . . . comment on the action with a wry snarkiness that is, in the end, the only thing worth watching
26737	2	a	Like many other good docs, this one leaves the audience thinking about the validity of the experiments.
26738	4	a	Fincher's Dragon Tattoo rockets through the freezing northern European landscape like the most powerful car on the market.
26739	1	a	The masterpiece among Lubitsch's later films.
26740	0	a	Such a project may seem pretentious, however, the charm of the film lies in its honesty, its purity and transmitting the mere pleasure of the director to honor the life of a silent film artist... [Full review in Spanish]
26741	4	a	It doesn't always work, but the film makes for an entertaining argument to reevaluate the legacy of Mary Queen of Scots, beyond the time-worn focus on her tragedy.
26742	3	a	One of the great social dramas of all time. The finale is a knock-out. One of Muni's best performances.
26743	3	a	What makes the film so powerful is how Tarkovsky's vision transcends the mere people politics of its frame to conjure an idea about Russian history and the transience of man.
26744	1	a	Bright Star isn't just a superlative achievement, for director Campion it might just be her best work yet.
26745	0	a	Hiller earns our emotional response because of the way he's directed the movie.
26746	2	a	The CGI animation is crisp and colorful, the characters have some complexity and there is clever enough writing to keep the parents amused while the kids have fun.
26747	5	a	"This comic book adaptation is an ill-defined mess of a film that attempts to shoehorn its character into a superhero ""origin story"" with vague hints of the supernatural."
26748	2	a	The cast is consistently strong, particularly Deneuve and Ardant, bravely throwing caution to the wind and mugging fearlessly in an all-out effort to bring down the house.
26749	4	a	An unexpectedly engaging futuristic mystery.
26750	4	a	Despite its charms, the movie didn't push over the top into true inspiration.
26751	6	a	Crossover comes with more swooshing/zapping/whamming sound effects than a year's worth of The O'Reilly Factor.
26752	3	a	You want great dinosaurs, you got great dinosaurs.
26753	4	a	Thankfully, there's no contrived Hollywood ending but you can't help thinking this is more a three-minute wonder than a dramatic symphony.
26754	5	a	The original was blissfully simple: alien sadist messes with the wrong dude. Here, nothing adds up.
26755	7	a	A lovable but bad mad scientist B-film.
26756	4	a	Good thing the people serving this utilitarian story have the wit to dress it up a little and make it dance.
26757	5	a	The Other Boleyn Girl is the kind of potted historical drama that's not good enough to take seriously and, sadly, not bad enough to be any fun.
26758	6	a	It's a horror movie one moment, a comedy the next, as if Netflix were streaming several different titles at once.
26759	6	a	The cleverness dies slowly in this horror spoof ... reaching bottom with a bevy of bathroom jokes and the offal appearance of Leslie Nielsen as a dithering, Bush-league president.
26760	4	a	You can guess the whole film but the picture postcard locations are easy on the eye and the wonderful Redgrave steals the show. Her heartfelt conviction and natural warmth slice through all the schmaltz to make the silly storyline feel real and touching.
26761	3	a	A feature-length demolition derby custom-made for members of MADD - Moviegoers with Attention Deficit Disorder.
26762	3	a	Amistad is a good, but not great film.
26763	5	a	Despite Paxton's whooping every time a new artefact comes on screen, it's hard to be constantly excited about watching a bunch of rusty, decayed junk -- historic and three-dimensional though it may be.
26764	0	a	...a romantic, gentle, and magical movie.
26765	6	a	It's hard to imagine this overlong, overplotted and underdrawn animation winning many new converts, either to the series or to anime in general.
26766	4	a	If the serious critic in me weren't fighting to be heard there'd be an extra two stars to give out.
26767	3	a	the clueless parents provide that Golden Age anchor to the piece that rings disquieting in the face of all the real wolves their Gidget is facing alone in the pathless wood.
26768	3	a	This is easily Van Sant's most satisfying film of his recent youth alienation pictures.
26769	6	a	These flies drift lethargically from place to place, and the movie bogs down in their lackadaisical pace.
26770	5	a	Eastwood's latest drama fails to ignite a spark that will bring an audience to see a film involving the afterlife and supernatural.
26771	8	a	A mean and nasty film about men consumed by the goal of triumphing against their competition in the most merciless way.
26772	4	a	[Garland and Rooney] seem like old pros at making the plot machinations seem at least a little fresh.
26773	9	a	Och, lads and lassies, on the souls of our shape-shifting Gaelic forebears, do not enter unwarned into that dark cave of confusion known as Highlander: Endgame.
26774	2	a	Succeeds as a laugh getter because of the spot-on satirical notes.
26775	4	a	"Gene Hackman and Ray Romano lead ""Welcome to Mooseport"" right into mediocrity."
26776	4	a	In his maturity, [Almodovar] remains a distinctive stylist and a dazzling film-maker with technique to burn. Yet while his new film Broken Embraces parades his many virtues, it treads water rather than breaks new ground.
26777	6	a	Another pot boiler with a great cast and a story that emphasizes facts, figures, and mood while leaving character in the background.
26778	5	a	"This sub-par scare-flick entry in the ""back from the dead"" genre starts smart but gets dumber as it goes."
26779	9	a	This film went so wrong somewhere, the
26780	6	a	Like David Spade's underrated Joe Dirt, Dickie is great in concept, so-so in execution.
26781	5	a	Heads into the garage for almost the entirety of its sluggish middle section, which turns into a second-rate Ocean's Eleven-style heist movie.
26782	4	a	Powerhouse casting and a heartbreaking history make the screen version of Marvin's Room more memorable than it otherwise would be.
26783	1	a	A flawed biopic anchored by solid performances and fascinating drama even if it poorly handles its gay subject matter.
26784	3	a	Screamingly, achingly funny. It's the kind of movie that repeatedly hits a comic high note and holds it for a sustained period.
26785	4	a	Has its share of memorable funny moments. 
26786	3	a	Infectiously amusing? More often than not.
26787	3	a	The ability of political power to impose narratives, says Chappaquiddick, has always been conditional on our willingness to believe them.
26788	2	a	It's warm and humorous and avoids being mean-spirited, which alone makes it special.
26789	2	a	This in-your-face homage to The Texas Chainsaw Massacre is the most unrelentingly sadistic flick to come out of Hollywood in quite some time.
26790	6	a	Del Toro has crafted a predictable movie that will likely only appeal to modern moviegoers thoroughly unfamiliar with Jane Eyre or Henry James or Bluebeard or Daphne du Maurier or, heck, even The Silence of the Lambs.
26791	2	a	Grohl's heart is always in the right place, and with his directorial debut, he has effectively translated his passion and knowledge into a delightful and engaging documentary.
26792	5	a	Hampered mightily by Luke Wilson's casting, Middle Men has energy and some sleazy fun around its edges, but critically fails to locate a sincere lasting feeling, be it titillation or trepidation.
26793	8	a	The ultimate example of heavy hype and puny payoff.
26794	5	a	...suffers from happy feet.
26795	3	a	With current comedy obsessed with oh-so-clever ironic gestures and tricksy pastiche, Meet the Parents' dedication to consistent, straightforward belly laughs is totally refreshing.
26796	1	a	Remarkably, given the very serious subject matter, the film exhibits an infectious comedic flair that never goes too far.
26797	4	a	Adults will get enough laughs to survive gags such as the chickens using a Col. Sanders dartboard but will likely lose patience waiting for the very predictable story and sentiments to slowly play themselves out.
26798	3	a	all of Law's talents are called into play and displayed to exquisite advantage
26799	0	a	Christian Bale's debut is a doozy.
26800	3	a	Wisely, James White leaves the unresolved troubles and feelings of its eponymous character unresolved.
26801	3	a	There should be a sequel to further explore this intriguing concept. Gather your pennies, Marshmallows.
26802	3	a	This is not an easy film to watch but it's relevant, courageous and full of grace.
26803	4	a	There are some decent special effects, but overall it's about what you'd expect from a movie inspired by a line of toys.
26804	0	a	Epic story of Jews during the Russian Revolution.
26805	4	a	One of those movies that gets a couple of things exactly right.
26806	1	a	Claustrophic and taut right up until the aforementioned pseudo-limp ending, it makes a great rental for edge of your seat madness.
26807	2	a	This is a good-looking film, and Jackson is just so much fun to watch. The other horror films that are out there? This one's a slither above them all.
26808	5	a	Hugh Grant just grins and grins as if to explain that he knows the material isn't up to par and he's just along for the ride.
26809	6	a	I've never seen anything like it. It's not that you look back after the credits roll and realize where the movie went wrong. It happens right before your eyes.
26810	2	a	Plaza is hilariously blunt, in a Sarah Silverman's brattier kid sister sort of way.
26811	9	a	It jumps from one path to the next without any sense of continuity.
26812	7	a	Another nail in the coffin of Ewan McGregor's career.
26813	8	a	There was reason to expect more from American Pastoral, and just as much reason to figure it was doomed from the start.
26814	3	a	Laugh-out-loud funny, with less sugar and more teen spirit than the likes of High School Musical.
26815	1	a	An astonishingly smart satire of superheroes, James Bond movies and, just for fun, socially engineered mediocrity.
26816	3	a	The world's only Charlie Chan film noir.
26817	4	a	If Russ Meyer had made The Other Boleyn Girl, Anne and Mary Boleyn would have yanked some hair, scratched some eyeballs, walloped each other in their respective kissers, and the movie would have been all the better for it.
26818	3	a	A fertile battlefield of sibling discontent and parental resentment, creating a prickly but inviting familial atmosphere that offers enough variation in woe to ease the script out of its occasional dalliance with clumsy melodrama. 
26819	5	a	It's a frightfully silly and insignificant horror film, whose only virtue is in the makeup.
26820	3	a	Shows typical insight into the awkward years.
26821	4	a	If [it] ends with a painfully contrived set piece, it also . . . adds rowing lessons to the metaphors of foreplay
26822	6	a	For its amusing premise, Fanboys is scarily flat.
26823	9	a	If you're looking for kid-friendly anthropomorphic animals, check out The Good Dinosaur.
26824	10	a	From the look of it, poor Debra Messing's first starring vehicle was an unmitigated disaster even before the cameras started rolling.
26825	4	a	Great satires draw blood. American Dreamz barely nicks the surface.
26826	6	a	Damn thing never seems to end.
26827	5	a	Despite a game performance from Christian Bale, American Psycho never quite achieves lift-off.
26828	2	a	If Crowe's films radiate one thing, it's kindness, which is something not a lot of filmmakers can claim.
26829	6	a	Similar to the scenario of the original picture, it's a band of grizzled soldier types who battle the alien menaces. Missing, however, is a formidable leading-man presence in the Schwarzenegger mold.
26830	2	a	Woody at his most autobiographical.
26831	5	a	Far from captivating.
26832	2	a	While Astro Boy might not exude the kind of originality we're used to seeing in Pixar films, it makes up for it with plenty of humor and charm.
26833	9	a	David Gelb doesn't evince so much as a single compositional sleight of hand, merely delighting in turning lights on and off and watching Zoe appear in random places.
26834	3	a	The film is sporadically hilarious in a chilly, unemphatic way. But for what may be the first time here, Kaurismaki also seems to be genuinely enamored of every mushy, underlying sentiment he might once have held up to withering examination.
26835	3	a	Relatability is certainly a key component of Knocked Up's inherent appeal.
26836	3	a	No present-day actor celebrates the working class like Hoffman, and he captures the ordinary joys and heartache of Jack, Connie, Clyde and Lucy with feeling and respect.
26837	0	a	Matchstick Men is viciously entertaining to watch thanks to a mesmerizing performance by Nicolas Cage as a man with more than a few personal idiosyncrasies.
26838	0	a	What makes the movie a masterpiece, however, is not the Coens' supreme command of their craft in these scenes, but their willingness to embrace the resigned worldview of McCarthy's novel.
26839	5	a	While the characters are interesting, their emotional connections are frayed and fragmented, leaving them floundering in this complicated dramedy.
26840	4	a	A warm and witty comedy that unfortunately runs itself into the ground during its final act.
26841	6	a	The script squanders many opportunities for real laughs and it continually plays it safe with sophomoric humor that would create giggles in middle-schoolers.
26842	1	a	"Although the story sometimes drags and the predictable rom-com ending feels too pat, ""Silver Linings Playbook"" scores some intriguing insights into what mental illnesses we consider socially acceptable."
26843	6	a	Sally Field outclasses some pretty waxy and unfocused material in Hello, My Name is Doris.
26844	0	a	Schrader puts his character on a collision course between the promises of faith and the tragic realities of world in environmental decay.
26845	5	a	About as middle of the road as comedies get.
26846	2	a	A minor classic
26847	4	a	Pound for pound, boxing must throw up more bizarrely larger-than-life characters than any other sport, and in the figure of Vinny Pazienza... [Miles Teller] is indubitably playing one of those.
26848	10	a	Remember when country music meant something to narrative filmmaking, when a tortured, soulful song put to film could document the doubts and dimensions of an entire generation? 
26849	4	a	Rewards long-time fans but contains basic flaws likely to trouble general audiences.
26850	4	a	"...a genial, inoffensive little comedy that coasts on the charm of its ""King of Queens"" star James..."
26851	3	a	Director Ava DuVernay retains a firm grasp throughout, balancing the epic and intimate, personal and political.
26852	2	a	Jim Cummings is a national treasure, if we have to be honest. And I think he has outdone himself this time, highlighting Pooh's beautiful soul using the most specific, endearing vocal inflections.
26853	6	a	There are welcome insights in to a culture largely ignored by society; unfortunately, they are married in to a domestic drama that slowly loses steam and never manages to overcome how boringly familiar its central scenario is.
26854	3	a	With its sheer warmth, openness, likability and idealism, Love, Simon won me over.
26855	4	a	Gibson has made an extraordinary, focused movie with blinders on, showing mostly one color -- blood-red -- from the full Christian spectrum.
26856	1	a	A gorgeous, fluid, soulful and often astonishing bit of poetic fantasy.
26857	3	a	A feel-good film, warm and good-hearted.
26858	9	a	...an ugly film, overwhelmed by transparent shock value, short-sighted storytelling and nihilistic undertones.
26859	3	a	...does not shy away from controversial elements of King's character.
26860	9	a	It's a billboard of a film-shallow, artificial, intrusive, and an offensive eyesore to the cultural landscape.
26861	5	a	The ending of the film inevitably leaves the door wide open for a third part, but judging from this amazingly lackluster first sequel, everyone involved should have quit while they were still ahead.
26862	3	a	As much a comedy as it is an action movie, actually it's better than that, it's one of the all too rare modern movies which manages to be both. 
26863	3	a	Still, there are moments of emotional truth, especially a key scene when Peter finds a way, however briefly, for Gloria to realize her dream of playing Juliet onstage. And if this movie revives interest in Gloria Grahame's vintage movies, I'm all for it.
26864	6	a	If you're in the mood for some school-girl daydream fairytale, Letters to Juliet about fits the bill, but even fans of this sort of thing are likely to find themselves short of patience well before the end.
26865	0	a	Paced like a Terrence Malick or Stanley Kubrick film it will not appeal to everyone, but for those accustomed to using their eyes, ears and brains at the movies this is a magnificent experience.
26866	4	a	Terrific music and a boatload of high energy can't quite compensate for a thin plot and weak characterizations....
26867	2	a	It's keenly observed, handsomely mounted, supremely well-acted, and distant in a way the period trappings can't quite explain away.
26868	5	a	Leaving aside the galloping misogyny, 'Rock the Kasbah' just isn't remotely funny or smart.
26869	7	a	I refuse to believe that there's anyone on the planet, starved enough for romantic affection, that they'd find something likable about this movie.
26870	8	a	I'm pretty sure that I can say it's not a great movie; I'm not so certain I can say it wasn't a funny one. 
26871	8	a	A witch would have to cast a spell over me to make me sit through this big, dumb, dull, dud again.
26872	3	a	It may not be the greatest love story ever told, but it might be the one with the most heart.
26873	3	a	"Ralph Breaks the Internet"" concerns a long-established friendship on the verge of inevitable, painful change, and Reilly and Silverman work every part of that dynamic successfully."
26874	4	a	What really shines in this animated work is the artwork itself. Its dark linearity and depth of field ensures a bounty of detail to look at.
26875	2	a	All it wants to do is scare a smile onto your face, and it often succeeds.
26876	3	a	No, Must Love Dogs, earned its smiles, and the only bone I really have to pick is that, in the end, I failed to bring enough tissue.
26877	3	a	Shifting gears to a softer, gauzier mood, Clint Eastwood's Hereafter finds the masterful icon charting new terrain.
26878	9	a	Quite possibly the silliest horror movie ever made. On the other hand, you get to see Patrick Stewart kiss a man full on the mouth.
26879	1	a	Smart, cerebral sci-fi. The perfect antidote to a mediocre summer of tentpoles. 
26880	3	a	Sausage Party isn't as profound as it pretends to want to be, but it's brilliant at being stupid. 
26881	6	a	The topic certainly suits the times, but the director's approach is as alienating as it is old-fashioned.
26882	3	a	Ms. Johansson fills the screen in her usually quiet but piercing manner.
26883	4	a	Furman is obviously working in the long shadow of Martin Scorsese and the Breaking Bad team. Still, he's learned all the right lessons, especially when it comes to music.
26884	2	a	Snow-covered trees, expansive mountains, intimidating desert; the film thrives on the brutal conditions of endless terrain.
26885	2	a	A sappy success, mixing laughter, drama and trepidation, but most of all, heart.
26886	0	a	A Cormac McCarthy horror-mystery with all its ingenuity and without Hollywood compromise. Happily for literature, the movie retains the fright and power of the novel with its shock ending.
26887	3	a	Proof-positive that screen chemistry can trump trash, and that it's hard out here for a nympho, too.
26888	5	a	Ribisi embarrasses himself by making Elliott sound like Hannibal Lecter, Flight of the Phoenix reminds you why The Aviator or Spanglish are so good.
26889	6	a	The story is so unoriginal and uninvolving that you may find yourselves wishing the drippy, howling, viscera-smeared creatures would take Mitchell and the other humans out.
26890	3	a	The slickly streetwise dialogue, atmospherically seedy UK underworld locations and the posse of hip, handsome male leads all contribute to the wild 'n' woolly high-energy entertainment.
26891	0	a	I've always said that the greatness of a film is truly measured over time, and this is one of the few films that is truly amazing to watch, and actually lives up to all that damn hype.
26892	5	a	This is the most racist film I have seen since the last Martin movie.
26893	2	a	It manages to be both funny and endearing because Field knows to play both the external comedy and the internal drama.
26894	0	a	A warm and comfy dose of old-school charm and smile-inducing entertainment.
26895	6	a	The genre's recent past has set the bar quite high, and Treasure Planet doesn't quite make it over.
26896	0	a	Any Bond fan will tell you this is the best film in the series. It's my all-time favorite movie.
26897	1	a	It's powerful material for Werner Herzog, a premier chronicler of the madness of men, and Nicolas Cage, who brings a fevered intensity to every project he takes on.
26898	1	a	An intelligent slow-burn thriller. Philip Seymour Hoffman knocks it out of the ballpark. Your patience will be rewarded. It wouldn't be surprising if he were nominated later this year for a posthumous Best Actor award. 
26899	4	a	The concept is much cooler than the execution.
26900	3	a	Amazingly, it all still feels fresh, even though Burton has since become something of his own franchise since.
26901	4	a	A worthy installment in Romero's Living Dead series or just another gory zombie movie, depending
26902	2	a	What makes this movie so adorable? It's the voices of Lumpy and Roo. They are full of sweet giggles and playful innocence and Lumpy's British accent is too cute for words.
26903	6	a	at times he gets carried away, still true, Woo is cool. This mission would have been next to impossible without him.
26904	0	a	An otherworldly tale of childhood and a definitive work of imagination.
26905	0	a	Robert Altman has delivered a lot of surprises in his long directing career, and his new comedy, Cookie's Fortune, is one of the most refreshing -- not because it's so good, but because it's so sweet and affectionate.
26906	6	a	The only really funny moments in Couples Retreat are bits that were clearly ad-libbed by the film's stars, Vince Vaughn and Jon Favreau.
26907	1	a	"Playbook"" walks a tightrope in how it portrays mental illness -- deriving humor out of its characters' actions while demonstrating just how deep-rooted their problems are."
26908	6	a	She's not who she appears to be. He's not who he appears to be. The people sitting in the row in front of you aren't who they appear to be, either. It's that kind of movie.
26909	6	a	Never incites enough of a rooting interest to capitalize on its inherent feel-good triumph-of-the-underdog arc.
26910	3	a	Leaves you with the lingering scent of truth.
26911	0	a	David Fincher has done it once again--he has reconfirmed his position as one of the great filmmakers working today and given us a film that is sure to go down as an instant classic.
26912	6	a	Following a smooth takeoff, this psychological thriller hits some turbulence and crash lands due to a preposterous, almost comical, turn of events.
26913	6	a	Paper Towns works better on paper than in practice; its ideas are infinitely preferable to the experience of watching the film.
26914	7	a	Vapid, pointless and wholly predictable.
26915	2	a	shines forth as a labor of love
26916	6	a	At times, the movie has the look and feel of the cheaply made late-night commercials that it mercilessly, and occasionally hilariously, mocks.
26917	4	a	The film's signature imagery is impressive and there are some good set-pieces.
26918	4	a	Once again, Depp slouches into a piece of mainstream entertainment and takes every opportunity to amuse himself.
26919	0	a	It's worthy of every accolade you've read with Frances McDormand's performance of vengeful grief lingering with you for a long time.
26920	4	a	The leads acquit themselves fairly well, but the biggest winner is Selleck, whose low-key charm and gift for light comedy are put to good use here.
26921	3	a	Mike White's script for The Good Girl is outstanding because of its combination of wicked mainstream humor and an independent film's dense sense of drama.
26922	3	a	The key to this movie's success rests in the central performance by Jude Law -- this easily represents his best acting to date.
26923	5	a	The master of the thriller genre, Alfred Hitchcock, knew that even the nastiest stories need light as well as shade. Fincher's too busy darkening his garish source material to care.
26924	7	a	A low-rent rip-off of Flatliners. The talented cast is wasted. 
26925	1	a	The perfect marriage of big-budget sci-fi spectacle and character-based comedy schtick.
26926	2	a	"At a time when journalists are being labeled ""the enemy of the people"" from the highest levels of our own government, A Private War is here to remind everyone that they're really not."
26927	3	a	Definitely outdoes the first film. It's the Godfather II of computer animated films.
26928	0	a	The Catholic hierarchy may be able to look away, but anyone seeing this film will not be able to follow its lead.
26929	4	a	... tremendously powerful performances... [Full review in Spanish]
26930	1	a	Such an exhilarating thriller ... don't be surprised if you leave the movie sweaty and exhausted from the workout. 
26931	2	a	The performances are a bit too underplayed to suit me, but the melancholy film is both funny and fascinating.
26932	6	a	The personable, good-looking cast helps things along somewhat but Daniel Taplitz's script falls short of success.
26933	6	a	While some parents might wish the film had more emotional depth, they will probably appreciate the gentle humor. Then they can introduce their children to the book.
26934	6	a	Usually insightful Ang Lee fumbles on this one - with shallow dialogue, inconsistent satire and stilted pacing.
26935	2	a	An intense and strangely beautiful film...
26936	0	a	A dizzying cinematic experience.
26937	0	a	Such a transcendent film--not simply as an entry into its action-minded genre, but as a dramatic piece.
26938	1	a	Skyfall is easily one of the best films in the series -- a cracking thriller molded to a shrewd study of Bond and his domain.
26939	5	a	As the film moves along, the action becomes more exaggerated, more coincidental, and more absurd, yet it never becomes any more exciting.
26940	9	a	Jamie Foxx and Colin Farrell never seem like the bricks who often star in dumb crime movies. The drug-world Miami Vice is itself the brick: dope for dopes.
26941	6	a	Jesus Christ is remote, a Superman among men, and his teardrops shake the earth.
26942	6	a	Sweet dreams are most assuredly not made of this, but then again, it's nice to see Uwe Boll clotheslined out of the video game-adaptation running for a while by such a smooth creeper.
26943	4	a	The Light Between Oceans is possibly Cianfrance's weakest film to date, but at the same time the strongest visually. [Full review in Spanish]
26944	2	a	Anderson's impeccable casting and music choices are captivating, and there is an amusing contrast between his attention to every detail and the convoluted storyline.
26945	3	a	As I watched this sequel, a certain good feeling began to make itself known. Yes, the movie is unnecessary. However, it is unnecessary at a higher level of warmth and humor than the recent remake Yours, Mine and Ours.
26946	2	a	...genuinely and deeply moving, and Damon's performance in particular grows into something uncanny and beautiful.
26947	2	a	Shults' film, which he also wrote, is a model of nightmare minimalism, trusting the audience to use their imagination to supply their own, patently more terrifying, idea of what the hell is shrieking out there in the forest.
26948	0	a	Nothing can beat a landmark, classic James Bond picture. They don't come around all that often. 
26949	5	a	...if ever a movie represented Hollywood marketing, this is it.
26950	3	a	A witty and warm-hearted romp.
26951	9	a	The script by John Scott Shepherd and Dana Stevens weds every cliche of the careerist cautionary tale with the predictable beats of the romantic comedy.
26952	2	a	It's easy to pick apart an action movie. It's much harder to produce one this clever, fast-paced and involving.
26953	4	a	A film whose limitations are the same as its appeal: It's a bauble.
26954	2	a	It is a great cheeseball of silliness, a 'B' movie that has enough sense to embrace its 'B'-ness and then squeeze, like a boa constrictor. It is intentionally sublimely ridiculous from beginning to end.
26955	0	a	A story told simply, with a dose of mordant humor that starkly puts its points across.
26956	3	a	Credit 'The Soloist' for avoiding sappiness while treating us to parts of Ludwig B's masterworks.
26957	4	a	Shows how filmmaking through market research, screenwriting by committee, and over-dependence on moviemaking technology can result in huge, colourful, loud but totally vacuous and heartless movies.
26958	1	a	The Soloist is not only a great movie experience, it's one of those rare films that might leave you a better person than when you went in.
26959	9	a	Suspension of disbelief is one thing but this movie asks viewers to suspend logic and right reason as well.
26960	4	a	If Moorhouse's film sometimes falls out of step, then it at least has the self-belief to go out in a blaze of glory.
26961	5	a	An unwise amalgam of Broadcast News and Vibes.
26962	5	a	A feeble feel-good fable that you're likely to leave with a very different feeling than the intended one.
26963	2	a	King's story is tragic, that's no spoiler. The film ends with a heavy heart, mixed with hope. Selma is an important film and it is profoundly moving.
26964	1	a	Alternatively devilish, wry, soulful, and witty, Hitchcock presents a singing celebration of one of cinema's great unsung collaborations
26965	1	a	"Impressively crafted, ""Ralph Breaks the Internet"" is full of riches, monetizing the experiences of our fateful duo and their persistent fascination with the world."
26966	4	a	While the collection of vignettes offers a few great pleasures, in the context of Jim Jarmusch's oeuvre, it is slight.
26967	3	a	Martin McDonagh channels Flannery O'Connor's humor and sensibility in a film that looks at the absurd world and laughs.
26968	3	a	What's important is that it avoids the unfunny jokiness and juvenile tendencies that define too many romantic comedies while also sidestepping the mawkishness of the Nicolas Sparks-inspired dramas.
26969	5	a	With great power comes great -- irresponsibility.
26970	1	a	This is the sort of material that can go bad easily, and Theron's performance single-handedly saves it from becoming a Lifetime TV movie.
26971	4	a	After finally seeing the film, there's no longer much mystery as to why the studio pulled it from awards season.
26972	3	a	The War Wagon is that comparative rarity, a Western filmed with quiet good humor. It is also a point of departure for John Wayne, who plays a bad guy for just about the first time in his career.
26973	3	a	"A compilation of captivating performances by legendary titans of music, ""Soul Power"" shows the real power of soul."
26974	3	a	It's an exceptional piece of work, while serving as a commentary of how the fight for human rights is still very much in its infancy, and how far we still have to go.
26975	0	a	...an impressive dramatic epic that articulates some of the myths of capitalist America in a personal and human way.
26976	3	a	"cowboy,"" no question; ""bebop,"" another matter altogether."
26977	2	a	A downbeat, elegiac mood piece and character study about angry, damaged people whose lives are as desolate as the dusty West Texas landscape they inhabit.
26978	2	a	Time will tell if this is a new Peter Jackson cash cow or just a bridge too far.
26979	4	a	... a fascinating glimpse at a lost world of women with skin of porcelain and spines of steel, and the men in their thrall.
26980	3	a	Pi is certainly about the burden of genius, but it very well may also be about mythical powers and faulty dogma in Judaism.
26981	9	a	Schmaltzed up, dumbed down, bombastically-scored family drama of touchy-feely life lessons.
26982	4	a	There's no great show of wit or tunefulness here, and the ingenious cross-generational touches are fairly rare. But there is a lively kiddie version of the Dickens tale, one that very young viewers ought to understand.
26983	4	a	Despite all of the obvious flaws, I did find myself caught up thanks to MacFarlane and Theron's chemistry, and there were just enough genuine laughs to keep me entertained.
26984	8	a	Implausible - with every urban cliche and stereotype - a complete waste of time and money.
26985	3	a	Mae West is at her inimitable best, in this risque tale that shot her to stardom.
26986	4	a	If Rock Dog were a band, they would be more opening act than headliner.
26987	6	a	Here's a movie that's not worth getting all broken up about. Or for that matter, going broke to see.
26988	6	a	The jokes are mostly funny, the divorced parents stay happily divorced, and we're treated to yet another earnestly dopey performance by the endearing Judge Reinhold.
26989	5	a	While the kids may sing a storm when at last they get down to mixing Beethoven, gospel and rap, in the good clean fun department this is monumentally weak and derivative.
26990	2	a	Wright has Jamie Foxx and Robert Downey Jr., both outstanding. Their performances make up for the meandering plot and occasional missteps; neither actor is ever anything less than compelling, giving The Soloist an emotional heft it might not have enjoyed.
26991	5	a	"Those who step up to the box office window and request ""Doom"" will get what they asked for."
26992	3	a	"It's Verbinski's trust in the audience to get his jokes and pop-culture references that makes ""Rango"" such an engaging ride."
26993	2	a	Where Agora sometimes fails as a film, it can never fail as a spark to ignite the fires of conversation. At last, this is a sword and sandal epic with its mind in the right place.
26994	1	a	a solid, resonant meditation on survival, on hope, on the value of life in the face of implacable hostility, portrayed memorably by an excellent cast and [Director] Weir's vast, brutal, awe-inspiring landscapes
26995	4	a	You can't help but feel a connection to Downey and Foxx and, to a lesser degree, a rooting interest in the story.
26996	4	a	A diverting bit of faddish silliness; enjoyable for what it is, but presuming more in its oddly postmodern way than it has any right to.
26997	9	a	No character, no commentary. Just slice-and-dice, pare-and-scare, scream-and-run and fall-and-die.
26998	0	a	Lost in Translation finds something that occasionally happens between people and presents it realistically...one of the best pictures of the year.
26999	9	a	A comedy deserving to be buried up to its head in sand, drizzled in cooking oil and then left to fry until crispy.
27000	2	a	As their entire mission rests on the most minuscule of actions, Corbijn has crafted a smart, slow-burn thriller.
27001	6	a	Poor Cuba Gooding. As if it were not humiliating enough to play a guy so clumsy that he can't walk in the snow without pratfalling, he also has to do jokes about being a black man in the Great White North.
27002	3	a	The Oscar-winning director has effectively captured the good vibes surrounding the initial festival.
27003	6	a	It plays rather like a humorless version of Barbara Stanwyck's tongue-in-cheek classic, Baby Face.
27004	2	a	The gang is back, ready to rock Las Vegas for a wild wedding weekend in the often hilarious if always cliched sequel Think Like a Man Too.
27005	3	a	[Aniston is] so good, she manages to overcome the occasional nuggets of preciousness and self-consciousness in the story.
27006	5	a	his movie, full of easy swipes at easy targets, comes off like that overly chummy guy at a party who got drunk too early and goes around taking too long to set up a joke that's already been beaten to death.
27007	0	a	A silent movie that speaks louder and with more power than a dozen films packed with pages and pages of dialogue. Definitely the year's best movie. 
27008	1	a	Coming-of-age tales are generally a dime a dozen, but here's one pretty much guaranteed to make viewers feel like a million bucks.
27009	4	a	The flick grew on me after I initially disliked it ... and that's something not many horror films can do.
27010	6	a	Bring a watch. You'll be checking it often.
27011	8	a	Silver Linings Playbook looks like your run-of-the-mill wacky family comedy, but it's an important film and a great one that deserves to sweep the awards it's nominated for.
27012	3	a	Inherent Vice is sensible and senseless, not as much a story as an experience of one.
27013	3	a	The film is sweet. Its observations of life in the aftermath of death ring true, especially for anyone who's traveled the contours of mourning.
27014	0	a	One of the most beautifully moving wuxia films you'll ever see.
27015	4	a	A kind of rehash of the fast parts in the first movie. It's not totally satisfying, but it's fun while it lasts.
27016	4	a	Despite some failings along the way, the film builds toward his and the actors' strengths; by its closing scenes, Bounce bounces back.
27017	2	a	Has no small amount of merit, especially in the areas of production and costume design, but... [not] in any meaningful way a successful or even appropriate follow-up.
27018	4	a	historical context is its great claim to fame
27019	4	a	...achieves the sort of zen chaos that defines the Die Hard films
27020	1	a	It's one of the year's most confident, visually arresting films, but it requires patience.
27021	6	a	The sight-gags and verbal repartee hinge upon uninspired, lowest-common-denominator hijinks.
27022	3	a	It will have you talking on the way out of the theatre and maybe thinking about that one glaring error in logic, but it's like an illusion, if you think about it too much, it will spoil the magic.
27023	3	a	"Not often does one see an animated family film where someone talks about experiencing a ""paradigm shift"" or says, ""I think your metaphor broke my spleen."" "
27024	3	a	What starts off as the best Charles Bronson movie not to star Charles Bronson ends up as a literary adaptation of a novel that thinks it means something or other.
27025	4	a	The Rover is dark and engaging, with superb use of the heart-stopping landscape around the Flinders Ranges, but it could be accused of mannerism.
27026	7	a	Angry Birds could be gonzo; instead, it's just kinda... there.
27027	6	a	Like a botched chemical equation, these seemingly perfect ingredients combine into a fizzle.
27028	4	a	We get to see some nifty special effects fighting scenes and stuff blow up gratuitously. What more do we want?
27029	3	a	The Good Girl'' will finally make Jennifer Aniston a movie star.
27030	6	a	Dupree sustains its groove for the most part, and in this summer of bloated spectaculars, it feels tight. It may be silly, but it's a pleasant enough diversion.
27031	4	a	It is not an especially brilliant film, nor does it execute its ideas with particular flair, and yet I cannot resist liking and being moved by it.
27032	7	a	Beyond a couple of cool guns and one long, gory, clever first-person shot, Doom is something the video games have never been: dull.
27033	2	a	Nurse Betty combines sweet innocence with the depravity that LaBute heretofore specialized in, to concoct a riveting dramedy of obsession.
27034	4	a	Fun to watch but you do feel like you have entered the movie half way through.
27035	4	a	Never quite thrilling, never quite dull, its overriding virtue is its competence.
27036	3	a	The standout is John Turturro, who makes Shooter a terrifying individual.
27037	4	a	Fey turns in a commendable display to more than prove her worth as a dramatic actress, while she is fortunate enough to be surrounded by accomplished performers making up the supporting roles.
27038	4	a	"The Soloist"" is not a film in which you anticipate Robert Downey Jr. will be twice doused in urine. Such are the territorial markings of Joe Wright, whose directorial quirks undermine moving moments and committed performances in this musical biopic."
27039	3	a	The amazing and brilliant thing about Herzog is the pure poetry he creates in his films. Really, the man is a poet
27040	6	a	Shockingly, the movie is never really heightened artistically...Miami Vice feels relentlessly tired and trivial in its raucous tracks.
27041	5	a	The CG animation looks like rubbery plastic instead of animals, and much of it is spent on jokes related to derrieres and hindquarters.
27042	2	a	The spirited combination of Black and Blanchett along with gorgeous production and costume design make this an entertaining family adventure. 
27043	6	a	The finished product so often feels like an early draft of a movie that's in dire need of further revision.
27044	9	a	When Bad Things Happen to Stupid People might have been a better title.
27045	6	a	Certainly not a good movie, but it wasn't horrible either.
27046	4	a	A solid retelling of an undeniably inspirational story but it's unforgivably bland in places.
27047	3	a	Any director this far along in developing an assured visual style truly is a director to watch.
27048	2	a	The film is void of action until a final duel that is staged with a believability that makes the supernatural skill displayed in most blind swordsman films seem preposterous.
27049	1	a	I've got nothing but praise for the work put into the art of this film, including the coloring, details, excitement and originality.
27050	1	a	My my, what a ride.
27051	3	a	Try to imagine the most disgusting, foul-mouthed, and disturbing Pixar film ever put to celluloid, and you'll probably land somewhere near Sausage Party. But not too close. It's unlike anything else.
27052	5	a	Ultimately we are meant to eat chocolates, admire their trembling lower lips, and choose sides.
27053	4	a	This movie worked beyond its gimmick. Entertaining.
27054	4	a	Sparked a big cultural discussion, but doesn't resolve its central dilemma very well.
27055	2	a	Far from a classic and won't tug at your heartstrings, but it manages to be captivating from top to bottom with a refreshingly sharp and funny screenplay, a great ensemble cast and a lively soundtrack. 
27056	5	a	The film is so slackly directed it might have been assembled by a focus group.
27057	6	a	"The Predator ... feels less like a tight action gem and more like a substandard ""X-Files"" episode."
27058	0	a	Eleven slices of comedy heaven.
27059	3	a	The Spanish director's noirish touches are a delight to behold and there are few film makers who can touch him for sheer visual artistry.
27060	2	a	Although the ensemble and energy of The Infiltrator are good, the film as a whole comes up a little short.
27061	0	a	It's also the best movie made by any American filmmaker this year, and quite possible the best thing Eastwood has ever done as a director.
27062	6	a	Feels like it was crafted by an outsider, with the cliche-filled dialogue reading like a rough translation.
27063	2	a	The film suggests the viewer see the proceedings in two ways, as a believer might and as an unbeliever might. This makes it really two films.
27064	6	a	Too scattered and insubstantial to be as funny and moving as it could have been.
27065	9	a	Sluggishly paced, shoddily staged, and featuring a plot full of inconsistencies
27066	5	a	The fatal flaw in plotting the material is that we don't care.
27067	2	a	Controversy aside, it is dramatically intense, skillfully constructed and often harrowing, in ways that should have an impact on people of any or no particular faith.
27068	4	a	A professional actor in the best sense, always credibly grounded, Damon is much better than the material, and so is Colin Ford who plays the troubled son.
27069	5	a	Only in occasional, uncanny moments - when someone uses an iPhone, or gets off a tram - does this world appear to intersect in any way with our own.
27070	1	a	In the hands of Cate Blanchett, who is wondrous and magnetic as always, and Rooney Mara, who has never been better or more touching, the movie becomes unforgettable.
27071	4	a	Right now, the question is how did Veronica Mars turn out as a movie? It's a mixed bag. Too much time wasted on a whodunit that's more like a who-cares. No matter. Mars fans will have a blast.
27072	7	a	Ultimately Hitchcock comes off as a glib film about a great film.
27073	6	a	Although the film does eventually give up its referential conceits, it comes far too late in the game to salvage any real emotional investment in the characters or their plight.
27074	9	a	Binder's script is a big-screen soap opera, which he attempts to offset with often out-of-place humor.
27075	4	a	It can try the patience. 
27076	6	a	The tables have been skewed, both storywise and culturally in a mere two years, and the comic groundwork in this sequel is the better for it.
27077	5	a	You can't help but feel that the movies have shortchanged Grahame once again.
27078	5	a	Children of Invention seems furiously scribbled in shorthand, undermining what it has to offer in contemporary resonance.
27079	6	a	At least it's a beautiful crappy movie, and nearly worth seeing for the special effects and set design alone.
27080	9	a	The nearly complete lack of laughs in Think Like a Man Too is reason enough to suggest that this production filmed in Las Vegas should have stayed in Las Vegas.
27081	4	a	They had all the makings of a top-notch thriller here, except for original ideas - a deficiency that's difficult to overlook.
27082	0	a	Like Shampoo, the movie is a comical carousel of beautifully joined overlaps.
27083	7	a	It's a very bad movie. So bad that the filmmakers have embraced its badness, relishing in its action-movie cliches.
27084	4	a	Chiklis breathes fresh life into perhaps the silliest comic book character adapted for the big screen with a genuine humanity that can be felt even through the bulky foam costume.
27085	6	a	"Everything about the way the movie version of ""Veronica Mars"" came to pass is more intriguing than the movie itself."
27086	3	a	"I Give It a Year"" holds a special place in film history. It's the only romantic comedy where you root for the main couple to get a divorce."
27087	3	a	This isn't a perfect movie, but it entertains and touches the heart, and it's certainly a big step up from Patch Adams.
27088	1	a	Cumberbatch is moviedom's man of the moment, and with this painfully human performance, the actor who has specialized in difficult geniuses finally cracks the code of compassion.
27089	3	a	The kind of slick, sleek entertainment that shows audiences a good time mostly because of an elaborately tricky plot.
27090	5	a	The turgid soap opera of a plot reveals little of the human truths [it] presumably wants to uncover.
27091	6	a	Wonderland remains too subjective and doesn't probe deep enough.
27092	5	a	Take Jack's lead and give this one a miss.
27093	2	a	An enjoyable little film about fidelity and intimacy among different generations. Worth seeing just for McDormand's performance.
27094	4	a	This film is strictly hit and miss.
27095	6	a	The story roots around dutifully in by-now-familiar SK notions of real life being stranger than fiction.
27096	5	a	A motorless, rudderless wreck that is top-heavy with cliches.
27097	2	a	In Enchanted, even the vermin whistle while they work.
27098	2	a	The period trappings remain impeccable throughout, crackling even when the script doesn't.
27099	9	a	full review at Movies for the Masses
27100	4	a	Being as susceptible to over-the-top gratuitous absurdity as the next person, I had as good a time watching the movie as I did listening to the shrieking and hooting from the audience -- both to join in the fun and keep fears at bay.
27101	0	a	A visual feast, a funny, entertaining thrill ride that's the best creation yet from the animation juggernaut better known as Pixar.
27102	10	a	Does the Nick Park charm work for a feature film? In my opinion, not really.
27103	6	a	"There is a great movie within Ang Lee's ""Taking Woodstock."
27104	5	a	The stuffed animals are more expressive than the real actors. [Full review in Spanish]
27105	2	a	Is it crunchable? Is it scrumptious? The best awful-looking film I have ever seen.
27106	5	a	The movie independently bungles everything it tries, like a Central Park busker who simultaneously sucks at juggling, harmonica playing and skateboarding.
27107	4	a	Even accepting that Close looks a bit like a fey, mummified Stan Laurel, viewers have to assume that everybody in Ireland suffers from poor eyesight to fall for THIS ruse.
27108	0	a	American Hustle is a reminder that it's a privilege to see work that's so masterful.
27109	2	a	Most times the tropes of gothic horror work well, particulary the ones relative to the geography and scenery. [Full review in Spanish]
27110	4	a	A splendid mish-mash of comedy and live-action.
27111	4	a	One comedy that will have you begging for more. A motley group of talented canines outperform the humans.
27112	3	a	I like it when Hollywood apologizes. And I liked this movie. Apology accepted.
27113	2	a	The film is far from being a breakthrough work within the horror arthouse, but reminds us that showing less often means getting more. [Full review in Spanish]
27114	5	a	Seemingly well-intentioned and inoffensive - but there are so many other films that do this sort of thing faster, better and with more jokes, including a couple from writer-director James L Brook's own back catalogue.
27115	3	a	Steinfeld's presence, and great writing, make this a movie in which most of us can see our own teen experiences relived.
27116	3	a	Does what it's supposed to do, and it occasionally goes a little farther than it needs to.
27117	5	a	Manages to be both very silly and highly forgettable. Only for those who collect killer-children films.
27118	3	a	The endearing charm of the characters - along with a plot that teases the audience with just enough information to keep them wondering what's next - makes Logan Lucky a winner.
27119	4	a	There are times you laugh, and times when you hate it all.
27120	4	a	A film with better intentions than execution.
27121	1	a	The Rider has a wisdom all its own. ... It becomes a film about how the pain of loss and disappointment enables us to bear one another's burdens. 
27122	7	a	If BET made after school specials, this is what they would look like.
27123	7	a	Seriously terrible, but it'll be roaring good fun on video.
27124	4	a	An educational outing, shedding light on a deep, dark place most of us have only imagined.
27125	3	a	Land of the Dead may not be the 'masterpiece' its promoters claim, but it is the work of a master.
27126	4	a	...at times, literally crackles with claustrophobic tension.
27127	6	a	[A] vulgarized portrayal of the Tudor court.
27128	9	a	When the executioner finally makes his appearance at the end, it will probably inspire the kind of delirious relief and good cheer from audiences that is usually only experienced when Christopher Walken makes an unexpected cameo
27129	3	a	[A] charming buddy comedy...
27130	4	a	The film keeps many of the same parts of the first one's winning formula, beginning with Hart himself.
27131	3	a	Pretty neat.
27132	4	a	Sorting through prejudices and nuances of racial perception occasionally takes Black or White into intriguing territory...[more often] a rather mushily obvious, TV-movie-style courtroom drama built on straw-man arguments.
27133	3	a	Jackson's ... fire-and-brimstone delivery adds a much-needed edge to the inspirational cliches.
27134	9	a	Watching The Angriest Man in Brooklyn is about as much fun as repeatedly punching yourself in the face.
27135	4	a	Intriguing characters that are woven together beautifully, but that doesn't mean they're people you care about and that becomes a problem when the pieces finally come together.
27136	8	a	Not since Death to Smoochy has a comedy underachieved so pathetically.
27137	5	a	Neither good enough to to really cheer for nor bad enough to really care about trashing it, it exists in that room-temperature middle where nothing feels like it matters.
27138	4	a	So-so adaptation of the Curt Siodmak novel
27139	2	a	The beginning of the movie is extremely engrossing, but just when you think Susan's journey is going to amount to something, Makavejev resorts to his old shock-value tricks.
27140	1	a	an awesome summer movie that showcases a director and some actors at the top of their games.
27141	0	a	Donnie Darko rightly made a star of Gyllenhaal.
27142	2	a	Its major problem is that it's not cinematic.
27143	3	a	The Coen brothers, once again, prove they are an American asset to film.
27144	4	a	I like the idea of this movie much more than how it actually turned out.
27145	4	a	Although there are several funny episodes, the picture as a whole never quite gels.
27146	7	a	Jacob's Ladder is the nightmare as Rube Goldberg machine. Lyne bombards us with omens and portents, but they aren't rooted in anything, and so the audience remains in a state of arbitrary, floating anxiety.
27147	4	a	The film is caught in this weird headspace of succeeding at its basest level despite missing the opportunity to excel at its loftiest instead.
27148	6	a	The characters act like robots, and the story unfolds like a computer program.
27149	4	a	It's an easy-going, likable film.
27150	0	a	Classic drama-horror with put upon Bergman and suavely evil Boyer.
27151	5	a	This film is proof positive that Bullock and Grant can make any film watchable and entertaining, no matter how ineptly made it is.
27152	6	a	It's hard to get in the film more of a sense than merely skimming the surface.
27153	5	a	A lackluster Beverly Hills Cop rip-off.
27154	6	a	Far from a championship movie, but it's fun while it lasts.
27155	4	a	Teller demonstrates the requisite pluck, while Ciaran Hinds and Aaron Eckhart are cast against type as Vinny's father and his paunchy, balding coach.
27156	6	a	Even Hitchcock might have had trouble lighting a match under these two actors ...
27157	6	a	The plot, as skinny as a latte and just as filling, won't win any new converts to the defunct series.
27158	6	a	Billingsley does a good job on selling the beauty of the island, but only a serviceable one in telling this story. Then again, there isn't all that much to tell.
27159	1	a	It won't diminish Sam Mendes' extraordinary achievement to say that those wanting a Bond film by way of Christopher Nolan shan't be disappointed. The pleasure is all ours, James.
27160	2	a	Sometimes the timing of a good story is everything, and this particular story comes at a time when the world at large needs a little more hope, a little more innocence and a lot more Pooh.
27161	3	a	...tells the story of a filmmaker who wants to make a great horror movie. Nothing more, nothing less.
27162	4	a	It is certainly not bad, but it is a more worthy product of marketing analysis than cinematographic analysis. [Full review in Spanish]
27163	3	a	What separates 'Stupid' from so many of the so-called 'sex comedies' of the period is its combination of cynicism and directness. Beneath the teasing and the titillation there are some genuinely provocative themes...
27164	0	a	...a brilliant examination of the nature of the modern encounter.
27165	6	a	Oh, and Jet Li? I tend to agree with all of you that think he's amazing, and he's phenomenal here. Too bad that quality hasn't translated into any of his English language films.
27166	6	a	The few thrills it does have are outweighed by its rather dumb plotting and an overly familiar sense of style.
27167	9	a	Everything that's good [in the film] has a downside, and everything that doesn't work has something that keeps it from failing completely.
27168	5	a	Except for 'youngster' Jason Statham, Stallone's band of geriatric heroes are pretty creaky 
27169	0	a	Heat hangs heavy in the air in this beguiling, almost overpoweringly sensual drama, which is languidly paced, and filled with the sleepy sights and sounds of a northern Italian summer.
27170	3	a	McDonagh's film is extremely well executed but it's also long, tangled and any higher purpose is difficult to discern. Sometimes, however, just saying the right things at the right time is enough.
27171	4	a	A close-to-solid espionage thriller with the misfortune of being released a few decades too late.
27172	9	a	The Break-Up is so depressing, painful and awful to watch that I felt like I had just been through a bitter divorce myself.
27173	3	a	A searing reminder of the relevance of recent history and of the timeless power of fiction to humanize people and crystallize sweeping events into personal drama.
27174	5	a	While I enjoyed Timeline on a purely brainless level, I couldn't get it out of my head that there was something stupid going on.
27175	3	a	It manages to build slowly into a whimsically charming story about finding love and making do with what life throws at you.
27176	3	a	On-location exteriors throughout the English countryside, elaborate costumes, and colorful sets overrun with tapestries, mounds of food and large sporting hounds make this one of the most authentic-looking period films in recent years.
27177	0	a	A quietly chilling nightmare of human frailty and strength, tense with a nameless disquietude. A supremely accomplished little film.
27178	3	a	"captures that perverse element of the Kafkaesque where identity, overnight, is robbed and replaced with a persecuted ""other."
27179	4	a	The problem with the film, plain and simple, is that it focuses all of its energies on the dinosaurs themselves.
27180	1	a	Offers as much delicious enjoyment to the viewer as it obviously did to the cast and crew when they were assembling it.
27181	3	a	Another great turn by the Coen brothers, with regulars Turturro and Goodman at their best.
27182	6	a	A silly, cross-cultural shoot-'em-up -- the sort of movie that will work for those with some time to kill.
27183	6	a	It's a paradox--it's at once exhilarating yet exhausting, thrilling yet boring, masterful yet banal.
27184	4	a	Most if not all of the shock jokes exist solely to raise eyebrows and break monocles. They're almost good-natured, even sweet, in their sometimes messed-up way. 
27185	6	a	The film appears to be flirting with the idea of superficiality and romance and wit and depth of character but never really explores any tack at length, except the agonies of their love.
27186	6	a	The story's dialogue may be wry, but what should have been a jumping-off point for a lively discussion about the meaning of life is really just a philosophically shallow wasteland.
27187	5	a	Leaves a viewer with the happy thought that she now can get back to nursing and away from films like Coffy.
27188	6	a	Not worth the trip.
27189	5	a	Murray is entertaining but the plot seems entirely arbitrary with characters such as Kate Hudson's happy hooker Merci popping up without much rhyme or reason. A real disappointment.
27190	4	a	Give the Wayans brothers some credit. For a movie that could have fallen flat on its infantile face, Man scores some points for thinking big.
27191	1	a	It's endearing, plotless and strange.
27192	4	a	For what it's worth, Monster seems amateurish and obvious.
27193	0	a	This is, in the end, a simple and beautiful love story-a 'Brief Encounter' that happens to be gay, told with humanity and heart-wrenching truth. It is also, of course, one of the year's very best films.
27194	5	a	It is unspeakably naff, unintentionally funny and unapologetically Christian. Judged on its own terms, it's a resounding success. But for non-believers it will likely prove a living purgatory.
27195	1	a	"There's a film to be made about how government secrecy came spiraling out from Bletchley to conquer the future in which we now live, but ""The Imitation Game"" would rather give you a very good night at the movies."
27196	6	a	As is the case with other unsatisfactory diversions, it is entirely possible to ignore the worst parts of this movie, to drift along during the lulls, slide over the half-baked jokes and just wait for Ms. McCarthy and Mr. Bateman to do their things.
27197	4	a	One of those Chia Pet movies: completely unnecessary, but vaguely amusing if you happen to have it right in front of you.
27198	3	a	"Has a certain audacity that's the product of Whedon, sure, but it also betrays a sense of ""I told you so""."
27199	7	a	The scenery is very pretty, but the constant reminders from the French guy about how Americans are always in a hurry and should enjoy life more the way the French do make you want to reach into the screen and hit him over the head with a cheese platter.
27200	2	a	Kids will be bored; adults will admire the movies good intentions, but be bored as well.
27201	3	a	Edgy and exciting.
27202	0	a	Elegant and tough, unpretentiously directed by Curtis Hanson, it doesn't for a second pander to what is supposed to be the star's target audience.
27203	4	a	The writers take the story precisely where we've come to expect. That said, we've certainly seen worse this year.
27204	1	a	For the first time in a very long while, Bening disappears into a character and turns in a performance that isn't about her shamelessly playing to the rafters to grab after Oscar.
27205	1	a	I Origins is bigger, bolder, and altogether more intellectually ambitious than Cahill's debut.
27206	3	a	Crowe finds just the right blend of easy crowd-pleasing moments while maintaining the strong sense of drama and character dynamics in which he excels.
27207	5	a	The incessant reminders of the outcome, along with the liberal use of split screen, serve only to create a disconnect from what's on-screen.
27208	1	a	[A] difficult and heart-wrenching story of justice perverted.
27209	4	a	It's difficult to dislike a film that begins with late-model, track-suited James Brown... delivering a monologue on matters of self-determination and the pleasure of bowel movements in the privacy of one's own toilet.
27210	3	a	Penelope Cruz is as hot as ever in Almodovar's noirish tale of raging jealousy.
27211	6	a	Martin Lawrence's painful penchant for overacting once again fells what could've been an entertaining comedic actioner...
27212	3	a	First Reformed is not only [Paul Schrader's] best film in a long time... but it's also the closest thing to a box office success Schrader's had since Affliction. [Full review in Spanish]
27213	2	a	An eloquent, well-crafted return to form - and return to corsets and period frocks - for Jane Campion, who uses the character of Fanny Brawne, the survivor, to give a unique perspective on the creative, terminal period in the life of John Keats.
27214	4	a	Keeps us squirming for about two-thirds of its running length.
27215	3	a	Even those unacquainted with rugby will be moved by the match itself, the sweat and blood and groans of the scrums and the torturous progress to an exhausting overtime victory.
27216	9	a	House of Flying Daggers is more like House of All My Children. With this many melodramatic twists and turns, Ziyi Zhang should have been replaced with Susan Lucci
27217	6	a	[Director Paul Weitz's] best work comes with plenty of breathing room. But American Dreamz is too busy and plotty to afford much of that. The characters end up competing for screen time.
27218	9	a	This action saga is driven into unintentionally self-parodic territory only a seven-year-old boy could reasonably stomach.
27219	6	a	It's not particularly fantastic, but Fantastic Four is passable summer popcorn fare.
27220	4	a	Somehow, Lim manages to keep you pinned to the passenger seat for over two gas-guzzling hours - with no perceptible drop in testosterone levels.
27221	3	a	Thrilling, sexy, and beautifully photographed.
27222	6	a	[It has] all of the excitement of being trapped in the desert without a map, watching a cow skull turn to dust.
27223	1	a	a film of intense yearning that uses the medieval painter as a launching point for artistic and philosophical inquiry, which necessarily makes the film narratively disjointed and sometimes challenging to follow
27224	1	a	It helps that Pattinson interacts with truly great performances from the supporting cast. 
27225	3	a	Hancock is what happens when you have talented people working on quality material: it's really a no-brainer that it works so well. 
27226	5	a	But what does it all mean?
27227	3	a	Turns a high-speed death-defying stunt into a collection of beautiful pictures assembled with visceral effectiveness,.
27228	1	a	Nothing less than a groundbreaking -- and magical -- art house reinvention of a genre that even Disney cartoons have been shying away from in recent years.
27229	2	a	Far from perfect, but it's entertaining, well-executed and definately worth a look.
27230	6	a	Vantage Point is a thriller that has quite a lot on its mind. The very structure of the movie challenges the audience's patience, if not its wit.
27231	5	a	Not Brooks' best, but it has its moments.
27232	10	a	Sex, drugs and sadistic homicide mark disappointing Sundance buzz-maker.
27233	4	a	Hotel for Dogs delivers warm messages about generosity and sticking with seemingly impossible goals. There are worse ways to spend a winter afternoon than with this amusing comedy.
27234	4	a	A twisted, well acted and quite compelling comedy of errors, until a brutal, over-extended finale leaves a very sour taste.
27235	1	a	Frequently this doc plays like a real-life Fellini movie, filled with beautiful people and bizarre incidents. And ultimately it's an unexpectedly touching love story.
27236	6	a	Eat Pray Love is mostly a slog; never giving us a compelling reason why its heroine does what she does, or how she became quite so tiresomely self- absorbed.
27237	9	a	"Christian Bale is so bad that I understand that after seeing his performance here, the film ""Newsies"" is trying to retroactively remove his name from their credits."
27238	3	a	This is a darn cute movie and I think you'll find it funny.
27239	6	a	Why must MTV stiffle the real talents of Brian Robbins?
27240	2	a	Topical director John Sayles thoughtfully illustrates two sides of the burgeoning foreign baby trade in this documentary-style film.
27241	7	a	"Little boys that play with action figures might get juiced up from cameos by the likes of Carrie Fisher and William Shatner, and the promise of a booby flash, but ""Fanboys"" is not an enjoyable ride for the rest of humanity."
27242	5	a	Feverish and unfocused.
27243	6	a	[Silent Hill] works up a decent amount of solid, creep-show atmosphere in its first act before making some absurd decisions of its own in its second.
27244	6	a	The film leaves the lasting impression of a story that takes place in its own elitist and hermetically sealed world.
27245	5	a	"If ""Identity Thief"" isn't the most outrageous social satire since ""Myra Breckenridge,"" then my name isn't Rex Reed."
27246	5	a	It looks as if it was produced by some computer programme, devised by accountants and market researchers.
27247	1	a	Liman can uncork leap-out-of-your-seat shocks, draw out suspense scenes with malicious finesse and even ease a touch of romance and droll humor into the yarn.
27248	0	a	Teens will be interested to learn that this movie was written by a man whose twin brother was for a time the more commercially successful of the two, both playwrights, which surely influenced his choice of subject and his approach.
27249	2	a	"This ""new"" Blade Runner is still a science fiction classic."
27250	6	a	A romantic comedy that's short on both romance and comedy.
27251	3	a	Touching, funny story of childhood in Sweden.
27252	0	a	A lively, exciting beat-the-clock thriller. Frequently sharp and witty. 
27253	1	a	Paranoid Park, Gus Van Sant's mesmerizing new movie, melds the dreamy languor of his last few films with a page-turner of a plot.
27254	2	a	Funded by fans, this follow-up to the cult TV show feels a lot like an extended reunion episode. But even those unfamiliar with the series will enjoy the twisty plot and smart dialog, plus the sparky Kristen Bell in the title role.
27255	1	a	What really sells it is a fantastic support cast featuring Paul Rudd, Jason Segel, Kristen Wiig, Jonah Hill and Leslie Mann.
27256	3	a	It is beyond baffling why British actor David Oyelowo has not been nominated for either a BAFTA or an Oscar for his exceptional lead performance as Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. in new drama, Selma.
27257	5	a	There are some pretty sadistic torture scenes for the gore hounds -- but ultimately this pointless prequel is about as thrilling as a wet towel.
27258	3	a	...breezy and effortlessly entertaining...
27259	6	a	The film progressively loses its credibility until there is very little left to support besides [Willim H.] Macy's latest extraordinary turn.
27260	3	a	Cumberbatch is terrific. His Turing is an intense, intellectual force and stirring mix of remote, vulnerable and present.
27261	1	a	Cameron gives Neptune a run for his money.
27262	5	a	If earlier Rogen and Stoller movies mined experience for laughs, this one is so contrived that it's like it began life as a checklist of things that are supposed to be funny today.
27263	5	a	A garbled, tonally schizo revenge dramedy with little narrative drive, which swings like a teetering drunk between Tex Avery cartoonishness and somber old school woman's picture.
27264	4	a	The film's substantial weaknesses deflate our enthusiasm and ultimately leave us wishing for a little more substance and a little less plot trickery.
27265	1	a	Cinematographer Dione Beebe ... fills the screen with lavish images that constantly amaze the senses.
27266	3	a	Intelligence isn't always a character virtue from summer comedies. But it is in this screenplay, attributed to five writers who boldly mix rude sight gags with a thoughtful story about accepting maturity and the drawbacks of equality.
27267	5	a	The film has some intriguing characters, subplots, situations. Frustratingly, though, the complete jigsaw doesn't fit together, hampered by plot implausibilities and unrealities.
27268	5	a	A serious misfire, unfunny, unexciting, uninvolving and, perhaps the worst sin of all, incredibly self-indulgent to the detriment of the audience's enjoyment.
27269	2	a	Taking its title after the famous filmmaker's surname and giving the making of Psycho itself limited lip service, the result is a Merchant Ivory experience for the wickedly cynical. 
27270	4	a	The movie makes for an engaging enough period piece.
27271	1	a	An evocative, moody road movie through the Australian Outback that's as sparse and dry as the desolate landscape it traverses, its deliberate rhythm punctuated by short periods of shocking, bloody violence.
27272	4	a	It's A Very Brady Christmas but with snappier dialogue and murder.
27273	3	a	More focused on emotion than adventure, it teases out the possibilities and perils of time travel without embroiling itself in the confusion inherent to the subject.
27274	1	a	The Artist is simply a pleasure to watch, if only for just two hours in time.
27275	5	a	Suffers from a case of schizophrenia; some of it is waaay too simple, cutesy and/or sappy for adults, while other scenes are too intense and adult for children.
27276	0	a	Apparently, their hearts did go on--and how. Easily, one of the year's best films. It's fantastic, with two amazing performances by Kate Winslet and Leonardo DiCaprio.
27277	9	a	Surely there are better alternatives for kids who deserve a respectful lesson in arctic wildlife. It may have its heart in the right place, but Arctic Tale doesn't have much of a brain to back it up.
27278	5	a	Since there always seems to be more going on in the head of the film's director than in the head of the man playing Andrei, the system did not work for me.
27279	2	a	A sprawling, melancholy epic anti-Western.
27280	3	a	Clearly, the filmmakers are in the mood for fun and not worrying how accurate anything is.
27281	4	a	"Ultimately, ""Palo Alto"" is a messy yet haunting portrait of a particular time in life."
27282	3	a	American Dreamz looks like a sitcom, plays like a sitcom and is a sitcom -- and also the riskiest political satire since Wag the Dog.
27283	1	a	A wickedly violent, action-packed old school piece of warped, twist-filled sci-fi and Schwarzenegger cheese. You'll wish you had three hands to hold this one.
27284	2	a	Hancock makes for one unexpectedly satisfying and kinky addition to Hollywood's superhero chronicles.
27285	5	a	The film is fast, colourful and weird enough not to be dull. But that still doesn't mean it is good.
27286	1	a	The Skin I Live In feels like the culmination of a process, and perhaps the beginning of something new.
27287	4	a	The deadly serious corporate malfeasance story doesn't mesh well with Williams' politically humorous antics.
27288	2	a	Three Billboards wobbles during its tightrope walk between comedy and drama, but is kept on-course by careful direction and two fiery performances.
27289	9	a	The only thing worth noting is that the film is beautifully shot, but too bad 'The Tourist' is a just a lifeless, boring romantic mess.
27290	9	a	Plaza seems profoundly uncomfortable as Brandy, maybe because she's a dozen years too old to play her. Or because the sexually frank movie calls for nudity she refused to do. That translates into a confusing character.
27291	9	a	Misses every target by a country mile.
27292	0	a	Theron makes Aileen realistically frightening and unreachable at times. Murder in her hands is certainly not cool.
27293	9	a	Ryan approaches a larger-than-life character... and helps reduce her to a plucky heroine straight out of a made-for-Lifetime movie.
27294	4	a	Whitaker's performance is the rock here. Even when the confrontations and evasions get a little ridiculous, he's neither wholly saint nor sinner, but something like a human being.
27295	3	a	A sizzling Brazilian real-life documentary by director Jose Padilha that outdoes reality TV in its dosage of reality.
27296	6	a	The Extra Man is a comedy, but the humor is so genteel and smug it's as if the movie thinks it would be rude for us to laugh.
27297	4	a	I almost wish that the film would have centered on Travolta and Haley's characters since the plot threads involving the four friends get wrapped up in about half-a-dozen The Usual Suspects wannabe twists.
27298	3	a	Mines the same dour forebodings as Cormac McCarthy's 'The Road' ... a grim little cautionary fable that relies on mood, character development and performance, not 'Walking Dead' gore effects. 
27299	5	a	It's in equal measure patronising, sententious and obnoxious.
27300	0	a	Murray is only one of many superb elements in Coppola's new film, a masterpiece on a level with her father's best work at the same age: namely, The Godfather.
27301	3	a	Any doubts about three Chinese actresses speaking English with Japanese accents vanish in the face of their deeply felt performances and the world Marshall conjures with magical finesse.
27302	7	a	Instantly forgettable fluff.
27303	4	a	This dreamy tale of wasted youth provides a familiar yet authentic portrait of the teenage experience.
27304	1	a	A compelling ride for die-hard fans of the book series, dramatic thriller enthusiasts, as well as anyone who enjoys Fincher's darker works.
27305	5	a	A quintessential paycheck movie, made not because someone had a terrific vision for how to adapt the story but because a studio owned the rights and thought they could make some cash from it.
27306	9	a	"Even by the low standards of Saturday Night Live-alumni movies, ""The Hot Chick"" is simply excruciating. It is loathsome, offensive, vile, and, even worse, it is not funny."
27307	4	a	Each scene looks wonderful, and the action is energetic and exciting enough to keep us hooked. Forget where it came from and it's not half bad.
27308	1	a	When James Cameron got a second chance to make a Titanic movie, he actually managed to make a better one.
27309	3	a	"Absorbing, often electric with the energy of the playing field, Invictus is packed with feel-good ""teachable moments"" without the sugary aftertaste."
27310	0	a	An early-established folkloric weight and timelessness runs throughout Dominik's neo-western masterpiece. 
27311	3	a	a brave, elegantly filmed, treasure of perseverance
27312	3	a	It's a classy weepy with some killer dialogue, but Bening is the big sell here. Given one of the juiciest roles of her career, she makes every moment count.
27313	6	a	Gladiator is a movie that while watching, you can enjoy; for a while.
27314	3	a	Has a terrific cast and laughs throughout.
27315	4	a	...as a breezy, mindless little comedy, License to Drive undoubtedly fits the bill.
27316	3	a	A well-written diversion film bursting with thrills, chills and well-placed humor.
27317	4	a	Interesting Coen Bros. venture. Goodman was most strange.
27318	4	a	Christopher Robin is very bearable. 
27319	4	a	"Emotional without getting sentimental, Our Little Sister is the sort of ""coming to terms"" therapy narrative that should be drooling claptrap, but Koreeda and his actresses make it seem honest and authentic."
27320	6	a	In Jonah Hex, Josh Brolin plays a Wild West bounty hunter who can talk to dead people. So how come he couldn't yank the film's director out of his coma?
27321	4	a	A rascally little play on words is the funniest element of Meet the Fockers, a sequel with big name stars and, only occasionally, laughs to match.
27322	0	a	Gazing into the abyss has rarely felt so good.
27323	5	a	Stagebound, unconvincing and tedious.
27324	6	a	Repeatedly tips its hat to Trainspotting in such a blatant fashion that it ultimately, and sadly, hinders itself.
27325	4	a	The producers have brought the franchise back to basics with more gruesome deaths and a twist that will have the audience wanting more from the series.
27326	5	a	Some movies seem so blatant an effort to appeal to a specific target audience that they ought to come with a viewers' advisory warning.
27327	6	a	"Ralph Breaks the Internet"" doesn't have anything new to say about our online behavior; it just wants us to log on and tune out."
27328	5	a	Take away the nudity and sleaze, and at its heart Middle Men is about billing. No wonder it needed all the jiggling.
27329	6	a	"Director Andrew Stanton...admirably decided to keep the material wedded to its time, but he can't get around the fact that his Tharks resemble Jar Jar Binks and the whole enterprise resembles last year's ""Conan the Barbarian"" remake."
27330	0	a	Cookie's Fortune is Robert Altman's sunniest film, a warm-hearted comedy that somehow manages to deal with death and murder charges without even containing a real villain.
27331	3	a	Clueless, Ghost World, Sixteen Candles and The Diary of a Teenage Girl are all teen classics. And now you can add this outstanding debut to that list.
27332	2	a	Black Nativity is an earnest slice of uplifting holiday drama that benefits from a smartly chosen cast.
27333	3	a	...just the sort of fast-paced adventure flick that today's kids aren't getting enough of.
27334	9	a	If you find bong hits, joy buzzers, and turkey fellatio hilarious, then perhaps sterilization is in order...best appreciated under heavy sedation and within close proximity of the fast-forward button.
27335	4	a	"As a baby boomer myself, ""Arctic Tale"" falls just short of the Disney gems. But the aquatic adventures of the walruses alone get my seal of approval."
27336	1	a	The film doesn't just feel like a double-length episode of the series. The scope feels bigger, the look is richer, and the focus on who Veronica is and why she's so good at this job goes much deeper than the show usually did.
27337	6	a	Sticky-sweet confectioner's paste, bad for your teeth and liable to give you a tummy ache two hours later.
27338	6	a	A head-scratcher.
27339	1	a	...Hoffman delivers a stunning, unforgettable performance.
27340	2	a	Some incredibly funny moments but some sail way wide of the mark and make the final piece seem incredibly uneven.
27341	3	a	In the role of the nun, Miss Hepburn is fluent and luminous.
27342	2	a	It's not entirely mindless fun on the level of the game, but it is just simple, goofy entertainment.
27343	6	a	Parts of Monster are grimly fascinating, but ultimately Jenkins and Theron don't give us enough reason to care about Wuornos or her sad end.
27344	0	a	It's hard for me to talk about this film without just hurling adjectives at the page; it's tender, beautiful, sexy, hilarious and deeply moving - a romance story for the ages, directed and acted with a passionate sincerity.
27345	4	a	The story looks promising up to a point, but then it gets downright silly with a series of car chases and improbable coincidences.
27346	6	a	For anyone who prefers their assertive homilies to crust over like a syrupy sweet, this loose adaptation of Langston Hughes's beloved holiday tradition will come on like a dream fulfilled.
27347	3	a	The movie skillfully delivers a series of fights, stalkings, plottings and chases, punctuated by a little brooding.
27348	3	a	A winner.
27349	4	a	By his [Park's] sky-high standards Early Man represents something of a slip, but so what? Not every Leonardo was the Mona Lisa.
27350	1	a	The film uses voiceover actors and Waking Life-style animation to re-create the infamous trial with amazing effectiveness and intimacy.
27351	9	a	The movie left me amazed - amazed that Nicolas Cage wasn't in it.
27352	4	a	Field, carrying the movie on her shoulders and handing it to us for our approval, makes us root for wistful Doris. Single-handedly, she makes the movie work.
27353	5	a	Like its hero, the film looks good but can't commit, talks the talk but has nothing to say.
27354	5	a	Donald Petrie's movie is so over-laundered that it has completely sacrificed shape for comfort.
27355	3	a	Unique and intoxicating, an art movie that grips like a thriller.
27356	4	a	A freshly microwaved mix of Blade Runner and Minority Report topped with a big dollop of cheese.
27357	4	a	Sinister and supernatural - with stunning sets, sumptuous costumes and stylish cinematography....
27358	0	a	"Balloons don't blow into funny shapes, and its narrative direction isn't fairly self-explanatory. Yet to watch it is to gaze at the chilling, pitch-black flipside of ""Raising Arizona,"" and be haunted by penetrating, unflinching stares it gives back."
27359	4	a	On the big screen ... Gods and Generals plays woefully stiff, hampered by the breadth of its source material and the reams of exposition required to explain the action.
27360	1	a	"The Way Back"" is a return to the historical epics of David Lean, a story of survival under unthinkable physical and spiritual hardship."
27361	6	a	Miami Vice, the movie, is an atmospheric muddle, as gorgeous and unintelligible as raven-haired stunner Gong Li.
27362	6	a	As lyrical as Angels in America may be, it hijacks the focus.
27363	3	a	A quirky May-December romancer that's subtle and low key in its sweetness. Garner and Field make for an unlikely romantic tandem
27364	9	a	When critics join in accepting this junk, is it any wonder few directors bother with fresh visions?
27365	6	a	I admired Julia Roberts' grasping for something meatier, but this film sticks her with an unrelatable character that even her coltish smile can't beautify.
27366	6	a	A weak little sister to Sin City.
27367	1	a	A criminally underrated film, featuring one of Spacey's best performances.
27368	2	a	Arteta's third feature is good step in the right direction, for him as a disrector and for Jennifer Anniston as an actress
27369	6	a	Anyway, it's all pretty ludicrous... there's not much else here that's worth giggling at, no matter how extreme the gags involving vomit, tampons, dope, scrotums and roofies might get.
27370	4	a	If reality's your bag, take a pass. But if you're looking for a harmless diversion to get you in the mood for Valentine's Day, this could be the ticket.
27371	6	a	It's an overlong film that looks great, but might leave you feeling a bit nauseous. Wait for it to hit cable.
27372	3	a	Lucas' vision of the future is disturbing. A wonderful first effort.
27373	2	a	"Zombies are back in another allegory - with the emphasis on the hardcore ""gory."
27374	6	a	As expected, She Done Him Wrong boasts few positive attributes or elements worth getting excited about aside from Mae West's typically magnetic turn as the brash protagonist...
27375	4	a	Get On Up delivers the funk, which Brown himself would tell you never dies.
27376	4	a	Gervasi misses a fine opportunity, wasting the acting talent he has assembled with a disappointingly ordinary film about an extraordinary man making one of cinema's most exceptional movies.
27377	1	a	It does what so few sequels/prequels do, making you hungry for the next of the series, while still making you appreciate very much what has come before.
27378	3	a	There is sci-fi and there is Cronenberg sci-fi and here he has reached his pinnacle with his hallucinatory, hypnotic trip. We are in Cronenberg's bubble until he lets it burst.
27379	3	a	Vinny's remarkable comeback story can make for compelling viewing.
27380	1	a	This is a guy comedy being mismarketed as a chick flick, complete with a poster that looks like a page from Lucky magazine.
27381	5	a	Bee Movie is best viewed as an oddball career move rather than as a successful movie.
27382	9	a	Why a director would try so hard to clean up the image of an inhuman convicted felon beggars belief.
27383	3	a	There's real emotion and consequence in this three-hankie weepie. It earns its tears.
27384	6	a	The good news is that this one, a ghostly gothic romance, is at least a step up from Del Toro's killjoy kaiju would-be epic Pacific Rim. The less good news is that... this one is strictly forgettable.
27385	1	a	[Sean] Penn's film does justice to McCandless' tale.
27386	4	a	...there's a feeling with Becoming Jane that we have seen it all before.... Many times.
27387	9	a	Sometimes, with a film like this, one grabs for anything potentially redeeming. It doesn't happen here.
27388	9	a	Jurassic Park III is a blunder.
27389	4	a	Pretty fair vampire film suffering from Landis' usual over-producing.
27390	1	a	Truffaut brought a fresh and piercingly honest portrayal of troubled youth to the screen. In many ways, Antonie Doinel is not only the cinematic embodiment of Truffaut, but also the French New Wave as a whole. 
27391	3	a	This is a film to be enjoyed for its eccentric performances; a hyper, engrossing dramedy of relationships.
27392	4	a	Overall this is a remarkably unremarkable film, lacking in subtlety and enshrouded in that depressing sense of Catholic guilt which Gibson no doubt wrestles with every night.
27393	3	a	...explores the same themes, but running in place has never seemed as witty, touching and visually engaging as it does here.
27394	3	a	...a stellar work of poignant cinema.
27395	6	a	I wouldn't race out to see National Security, but it does give you exactly what you'd expect: yuks, explosions and brawling buddies rolling all over those overused L.A. freeways.
27396	3	a	"A resplendently mounted thriller, old-fashioned in spirit and decked with lavish production values. ""Crimson Peak"" is classically confident, aesthetically arresting moviemaking."
27397	5	a	For all its misguided qualities, the movie is at least perfectly cast.
27398	2	a	Friends with Kids is not a lecture, though -- rather, a romantic comedy for adults for whom issues like family planning are a reality.
27399	6	a	The mixing of vague historical anecdote and pure Hollywood fantasy don't quite mix.
27400	5	a	The effect works better than you might guess, though it's still an ugly, artless movie.
27401	2	a	Wow, this movie is totally insane.
27402	4	a	While there's plenty of gothic atmosphere, and two delightful performances from Jack Black and Cate Blanchett, Roth never quite figures out how to make The House with a Clock in Its Walls tick.
27403	3	a	At times the movie approaches a purely cinematic form as the simple narrative hitches and winds around itself and the soundtrack... hums along
27404	3	a	Although the film drags with a too-long escapade through the streets of London and sometimes trips over its predictability, there is a sweetness and comfort to it all.
27405	4	a	One's admiration for Close's work becomes more for her versatility and fearlessness than a connection with the character she portrays.
27406	5	a	Tensions predictably escalate and we're forced to spend the rest of the movie pretending like we care if these two annoying slices of Wonder Bread end up together.
27407	4	a	It does feel more like a throwback to a time when studio films weren't ruthlessly divvied up as prestige pictures or blockbusters.
27408	6	a	Kind of a mess.
27409	5	a	...a festive film. [Full Review in Spanish] 
27410	4	a	... captured by the sensual camera of Sayombu Mukdeeprom: a kind of pastoral Arcadia in which all the senses reign. [Full review in Spanish]
27411	8	a	If you've never experienced GHOSTBUSTERS on the big screen, you really need to go see this. If not I'm afraid you'll have to turn in your geek card. 
27412	8	a	The story is almost identical to those who inhabit it: furious, unable to contain their words, brutal and honest at every moment. [Full Review in Spanish]
27413	3	a	Quiet, solemn, and introspective, Lost in Translation conveys so much emotion with so few words.
27414	3	a	A heartfelt, pathos-driven coming-of-age story that would make John Hughes incredibly proud.
27415	0	a	An absolute must-see.
27416	4	a	What could go wrong? Rather a lot and the most enjoyable parts of. Soderbergh's smartly written film involve the negotiations and shared worries of the amateurish but thoroughly lovable gang.
27417	5	a	How do you know you've got a dud? When a cast this talented and determined can't lift a soporific screenplay to entertaining heights.
27418	5	a	It's the recycled plot, tired romantic complications, hackneyed rivalries and soap operatics between the dance-offs that are the trouble.
27419	2	a	Works in bits and pieces and it's hard to care about the plot very much, but it's all so lovably goofy that it's hard to resist
27420	3	a	"It's no ""American Sniper,"" and enjoyable as it is, the stunt casting is self-defeating. Still, you can't help but be moved by the valor of these young men."
27421	3	a	A sweet-natured trifle, as flavorful and as thin as a crepe.
27422	5	a	It's not an inherently flawed premise, but it is in writer Roth's saccharine-stained hands. It's frustrating, because it's easy to see how it could have been so much better.
27423	6	a	The whole enterprise has the sweaty sheen that comes from trying too hard to be cool.
27424	3	a	It boasts a superb cast and features an excellent performance from Jennifer Aniston.
27425	6	a	Ang Lee's heart may be in the right place with his Iraq War thumb-sucker Billy Lynn's Long Halftime Walk, but his head is somewhere in the clouds.
27426	3	a	Aniston maintains the character's superficially simple patina even as she communicates her churning inner life. It's an appealing, highly disciplined performance.
27427	6	a	Its heart is in the right place, but a reliance on gimmicks and sentiment undermines the story. In the end, both the laughs and the tears here come just a little too cheap. 
27428	2	a	A film composed of different vignettes starring the eponymous character while breaking the conventional biopic narrative. [Full review in Spanish]
27429	3	a	not your traditional action flick, nor your traditional cop flick. It has elements of each, all wrapped up in a new type of story that drips in realism and gray characters.
27430	4	a	You realize just how forthrightly rote and businesslike Cradle is. And you don't mind. Because business, it turns out, is good.
27431	10	a	The only reason to see this atrocity is if you want your significant other to terminate the relationship because of your terrible taste in films.
27432	3	a	It's still easy to fall for this sorcerer's spell.
27433	5	a	An absurdly over-scaled and wildly implausible drama that misses the mark so often that most people will likely come out of it... befuddled as they desperately try to understand what the point of the whole endeavor was in the first place.
27434	4	a	Considering the turgid potboiler it's based on, we should be grateful Eastwood achieved as much as he did.
27435	8	a	A poorly conceived comedy spotlighting a collection of anal-centric humor that's about as appealing as baseball bat to the face.
27436	9	a	If you can work your way past Vantage Point's goofy casting that places a bland, blank-eyed Hurt in the White House, then I suppose you can manage to forgive this Rashomon rip-off's other glaring idiosyncrasies, of which there are many.
27437	5	a	This tedious vanity piece is enlivened only by the charm of its leading man, Bill Murray
27438	4	a	The movie tries its hardest to celebrate the impetuousness of its hero and the exhilaration of his accomplishments. Mostly, though, it just reminds you of the severity of his mistakes.
27439	4	a	If the film is a bit too soft on its subject, it is even more taken with its leading lady. Theron overwhelms.
27440	5	a	I kept expecting someone to run into the Knights Who Say 'Ni.'
27441	4	a	The inspirational story is better than the overall product, which contains mediocre performances and an annoyingly long ending. Invictus is a great rental.
27442	4	a	"A fine remake of ""Lady Snowblood,"" with Donnie Yen fight choreograpy to boot"
27443	6	a	An agreeable though tame animated picture that more than does the trick but is unlikely to become a super buzz flick.
27444	4	a	Uneven but oddly likeable.
27445	3	a	An underdog classic of camp.
27446	4	a	Silly grizzly horror flick; one that is so bad, it's good.
27447	4	a	Resident Evil may be brain dead but it's great popcorn entertainment nonetheless.
27448	4	a	American Pastoral is a flawed film that lacks inspiration, but it has its moments, and the story might strike a chord with parents.
27449	5	a	Kiss my asp.
27450	4	a	Fans of this franchise know precisely what to expect, and the film delivers it with wit and flair.
27451	9	a	Scenes are poorly knitted together, especially toward the end. Time and tempo break down, as if the film were snapping apart at the seams.
27452	5	a	What's left is a lot of moral grappling, not all of which has one iota of relevance to the plot.
27453	5	a	Catch it on HBO for the sheer delight of everything Hoffman and Streisand do. It's fun to meet the Fockers themselves, but the rest of the movie can stay home.
27454	5	a	Vaughn, who has fooled Hollywood into thinking he's a real actor, has two basic styles: motor-riff quickly through dialogue or stand still and imitate a brick. 
27455	6	a	In addition to its armchair analysis, A Private War offers a lead performance that calls attention to itself. 
27456	5	a	The actors are left grasping for laughs as the script tries to figure out just what it wants to be.
27457	5	a	Uneven series finale is best when there's music. 
27458	5	a	The cast often rises above this tonally bonkers fable, where dark comedy wraps around a melodrama, which all gives way to a noirish revenge story.
27459	1	a	Fantastic all the way
27460	0	a	House of Flying Daggers has all the visual extravaganza of Hero but thrice its emotional heft, putting it on par with Ang Lee's extraordinary CTHD.
27461	7	a	A blood-simple backwoods spatterfest that makes shameless use of the same old antirural moonshine Hollywood's been bootlegging for decades.
27462	3	a	The rare movie that refuses to go easy on the experience of having a serious illness or what it takes to take care of someone who does.
27463	3	a	Brosnan gives a portrayal as solid and as perfect as his outstanding performance as Bond in Die Another Day.
27464	5	a	...no matter how hard he's tried, Vin Diesel continues to struggle in movies where he's required to do more than drive a car as fast as he can.
27465	7	a	High octane camp that's so ridiculous in so many ways that it's impossible to suppose that the filmmakers weren't at least slightly doing it on purpose.
27466	4	a	The film feels as glitzy and superficial as the fashion industry itself, a bauble in full regalia, and it's likely your interest in the documentary will depend largely on your prior interest in the subject matter.
27467	3	a	Terrifyingly realistic dinos run amok in sci-fi landmark.
27468	5	a	Mixing animation and live action nearly seamlessly, I, ROBOT turns Isaac Asimov's robot world into the backdrop for a prosaic summer action film.
27469	3	a	A therapeutic guilty pleasure.
27470	3	a	A romantic comedy that's both funny and warmhearted.
27471	6	a	Dupree's actions seem to be those of an extreme closet case, complete with an Audrey Hepburn fixation and a don't-ask/don't-tell obsession for his best friend.
27472	6	a	...the movie's less-than-engrossing atmosphere [is] compounded by its stagy and distressingly uneventful midsection...
27473	3	a	The first two acts are overpowering specimens of effects-amped, screen-incinerating hysteria.
27474	4	a	...may be fluff, but it is patient, character-driven fluff.
27475	3	a	At once a compelling story and a meditative experience -- not something you'll find in Hollywood karma.
27476	6	a	Spike Lee gets a good perfromance from newcomer Phifer as the young crack dealer, but the movie is diffuse, paying too much attention to the urban environment and not enough to the personas and dilemmas of the central characters.
27477	2	a	Bold and beautiful in its hard-charging simplicity.
27478	5	a	If you've seen The Hunger Games, Divergent or The Maze Runner, there are no surprises in this low-rent X-Men knockoff.
27479	6	a	While sometimes evocative, they don't add up to a satisfying movie any more than, as several characters are cautioned, coffee and cigarettes constitute a healthy lunch.
27480	6	a	Dreamworks Animation is not Pixar, no matter how hard it tries. Dreamworks' animated films lack the sort of effortless charm, animated grace and satirical wit that Pixar seems to generate instinctively.
27481	1	a	What makes the effects work all the more impressive is how they are used to support story ideas rather than to serve as gratuitous eye candy.
27482	6	a	What is the point of 'Revolutionary Road,' besides providing a showcase for two dynamic actors, Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet, to chew the scenery in an overwrought exposition of domestic combat?
27483	8	a	The idea of a horror prequel is annoying [and] unlike Hostel or Wolf Creek, TCM:B is rank and depressing.
27484	1	a	New technology was used for the space program and, appropriately enough, new IMAX technology enlarges the experience.
27485	4	a	Amusing and impeccably designed and photographed, the latest work from Wright, Pegg, and Frost comes across a tad undercooked, as though the creative team was backed into making a movie instead of triumphantly mounting one.
27486	6	a	A desperate, unfocused collection of bits and schtick that sends you out of the theater exhausted and unsatisfied.
27487	9	a	Madonna's acting performance is not more or less than average. 
27488	1	a	Interviews, images and events accumulate, driving the story to its sad end with the implacable momentum of a Greek tragedy.
27489	5	a	"...it's like ""Farewell My Concubine"" crossed with ""The Year of the Yao"" - but despite some really incredible dance, Li's bestselling book may be preferable to Beresford's screen adaptation."
27490	1	a	A strikingly physical as well as thoughtful drama.
27491	3	a	Padhila's carefully assembled documentary has the fascination of a car wreck -- only any number of social themes ripple through this real drama.
27492	4	a	Despite its often-overwhelming nonsensicality, there's ultimately something irresistibly fiendish about Silent Hill.
27493	4	a	Sandra Bullock and Hugh Grant make a great team, but this predictable romantic comedy should get a pink slip.
27494	2	a	Yes, the plot is totally predictable. But the smart script consistently tweaks the formula, allowing director/cowriter Graff to pull off the near-impossible: making a movie that neither sells out nor talks down to teens.
27495	8	a	Brooklyn isn't heartbreaking, heartwarming, or funny. Instead, it's unbelievably awkward, and when it isn't artificial it's wrongheaded.
27496	3	a	One hell of an action movie. But yes, its goals are high enough, and perhaps even misguided enough, that meeting them may create some potential problems for the franchise.
27497	3	a	One of the best and simplest ideas for a film in a long time. It's too bad the ending doesn't compare with the rest of the film, but still a good time. 
27498	3	a	Mr. Grohl has put a lot of affection into this film, and it shows.
27499	3	a	As Aileen Wuornos, the notorious Florida murderer, Charlize Theron pulls off the year's most astounding screen makeover.
27500	1	a	[Frances] McDormand commands the material, instead, by playing Mildred small and close; her volatility-and her pain-are right there in her acute gaze and pursed mouth, but she rarely even has to raise her voice. 
27501	7	a	They did manage to achieve the near-impossible: to show all that coffee drinking without a single Starbucks, but that certainly doesn't qualify as entertainment.
27502	7	a	...The latest proof that trying to adapt a film from a video game is a bad idea.
27503	3	a	...combines skill, danger, surprise and catastrophe in one of the most effective ways I've seen lately.
27504	3	a	Almodovar ups the sicko factor with arguably one of the best plot twists in the past ten years of movie-making.
27505	6	a	Just silly and sappy enough that it might appeal to preteens, but I can't see many outside of that age group embracing it.
27506	5	a	There are several old adages actors should follow when considering a film role: never work with children, cute barnyard animals or do movie adaptations of video games.
27507	6	a	so damn weird in refusing to go where one expects that it maintains interest - too bad it missed a chance at last minute redemption with a satisfying conclusion
27508	3	a	New Hollywood moguls Spielberg and Lucas teamed up to create the first -- and best -- of their extremely popular plunderings of old adventure serials ... In retrospect, it also appears as a precise pop-culture inauguration of Reagan-era retro Americanism.
27509	5	a	The film is all special effects and testosteronic bellowing by Matthew McConaughey and Christian Bale.
27510	6	a	It rushes through history as if it were firemen rushing to a fire.
27511	5	a	The only thing that will keep your attention for the duration is the stunning Tahitian scenery that acts the films setting. On reflection this is probably what swayed most of the cast to sign up to this inane guff of a film in the first place.
27512	3	a	Here's a popcorn flick strong enough for a man and gentle enough for a woman.
27513	0	a	"Creating escapism is what Spielberg is all about, and he nails it with ""Ready Player One."
27514	4	a	A modest but bubbly comedy of manners. [Blu-ray]
27515	3	a	Ultimately, the film works because Schlesinger handles the comedy-to-drama transition with skill.
27516	8	a	Benjamin Button is an absolute masterpiece and is probably one of the greatest films of all time.
27517	6	a	The great thing about monsters is that they glide noiselessly from nightmare straight into myth, fully formed and eternally mysterious. To know what made them is to explain them. And once you explain anything, you begin to lose your fear of it.
27518	3	a	Enjoyable family comedy.
27519	4	a	The popcorn out in the lobby would seem a more compelling attraction
27520	3	a	There is... something intriguing in Younger and Teller's understanding of the film's hero. An all-round addict who frequents sleazy strip clubs and gambling dens, Vinny's rage against impossible odds is both admirable and utterly crazed. 
27521	1	a	I just don't know if we'll see a film as smart or fun or overwhelmingly rich as Rango for the rest of the year. 
27522	4	a	In this instance, Black seems intent on catering to as many different types of nostalgia as possible.
27523	7	a	A hackneyed backstage soap opera...with all the subtlety of the lyrics of the country-western songs that fill the soundtrack.
27524	2	a	It's not art ... it's entertainment, and it knows it. Boy, does it entertain.
27525	4	a	Entertaining in bursts, though lacking insight
27526	3	a	Cage's performance earns nothing but applause from me.
27527	1	a	We often feel like our hopes and dreams are over once a child enters the equation, but it's movies like this that help remind us it's only the beginning.
27528	2	a	Slight and overly eager to impress with its flourishes, but sufficiently brisk and colorful to prove satisfying nonetheless.
27529	2	a	If theory ultimately outstrips drama in this semi-serious inquest into identity, gender and love, the filmmaking is often thrilling.
27530	5	a	Despite an intriguing premise, it doesn't really go anywhere.
27531	7	a	"Sequel to the mediocre Ben Stiller comedy ""Meet The Parents"" is a bawdier but inferior movie that relies on the star power of Dustin Hoffman and Barbara Streisand as Stiller's Florida-dwelling Jewish hippie parents Bernie and Roz to fuel its ill-timed toi"
27532	4	a	[Liam's] bleak story is a compelling one, but more tiring than inspiring.
27533	4	a	The lively film's main asset is an appearance by rocker Jerry Lee Lewis.
27534	1	a	No matter how grim it's looking for certain kinds of laughter, as long as there's David O. Russell, things will be OK.
27535	3	a	The avalanche of family ... is a hoot and a half.
27536	5	a	Maybe it's too early to say MacFarlane can't make a movie. He's still young, he's compulsively creative. He'll keep getting more chances. He could figure it out, but I don't think I want to watch him try.
27537	4	a	It benefits from a supernaturally engaging cast, but this treads too closely to the rom-com model to feel as smart or moving as Westfeldt's previous best.
27538	3	a	Modest in the best sense of the word, this traditional animated film adheres closely to the gentle, easygoing tone of the hugely popular PBS series.
27539	9	a	About as contemptible as filmmaking gets.
27540	0	a	Enough to give you hope for the future of American movies.
27541	3	a	A teen comedy of warmth, wisdom, perspicacity and real emotional clout? Weren't these cancelled?
27542	6	a	Did director Bruce Beresford have to ratchet up the saccharine of an innately sentimental story?
27543	2	a	While the relationship between Moore and Stewart's characters is interesting, most of the film follows well-traveled roads.
27544	5	a	Rogen tests the limits of his likeability as the spoilt brat who inherits an empire while Gondry scrabbles for the right tone.
27545	0	a	It's both a summation of Capra's own career and a peak of achievement for a gentler kind of American cinema
27546	4	a	You have to question the time and care you want to invest in a character whose goal is to excel at insults
27547	3	a	Sure, it's a bit long but this is a weird and wonderful trip of a movie.
27548	0	a	Romero's satiric cultural slant has never been as finely tuned and elevates just another chapter into something deeper and scarier.
27549	0	a	Like his wizardly lyrics, Eminem's performance and his film have unexpected depth.
27550	10	a	The slim charms of the previous movies have been tossed away in favor of cringe-inducing cattiness and a ridiculous plot. There's barely even any music. Aca-palling.
27551	0	a	This is one of the finer dramas to come down the pike in some time.
27552	6	a	Sporadically intriguing but ultimately ineffective...
27553	3	a	A Most Wanted Man is primarily a showpiece for Hoffman, who turns in the most controlled performance in his often-overwrought career.
27554	4	a	Inspired by true events, the movie may be too simple and earnest, wearing its ideology on its sleeves, but it's powerful story of injustice that needs to be told and it's well performed by Beharie, who may emerge as a dramatic leading actress.
27555	6	a	Although it's a mediocre thriller at best, it has a certain pulp charm and appealing toughness to it.
27556	1	a	"Between the visuals and the Pitt factor, this is a movie your girlfriend will dig, but there's enough crazy fantasy stuff going on that I'd never call it a ""chick flick."
27557	3	a	Docs like this help to banish the fear of movie audiences that non-fiction pics are nothing but talking-heads bore-fests.
27558	0	a	Like its effortlessly chic central character, Todd Haynes's adaptation of Patricia Highsmith's novella is impeccably put together.
27559	7	a	The movie has an earnest tone, and a burnished golden glow that's pleasing to the eye, but the characters have no life beyond their immediate problems, and the actions the plot requires them to take to resolve them.
27560	6	a	With fire in her eyes and the riddle of the solar system in her brain, Weisz struggles in fleshing out a historical character well worth a movie, though frustratingly sketchy as written here.
27561	2	a	Gil still believes in magic and Golden Ages and idolizes the writers and artists of the Lost Generation the way some boys worship Kobe Bryant and Peyton Manning. 
27562	7	a	A disaster.
27563	3	a	"A thorough and provocative portrait, which shies away from anthropomorphising Nim as much as possible - accentuating his animal nature as well as what might be considered more ""human"" attributes."
27564	2	a	Hancock is not the light and fluffy comedy you may think it is - it's dark and coarse, but well worth checking out.
27565	3	a	The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey had me with the dulcet melancholy of displaced Dwarves, yearning to be home.
27566	0	a	Carol is a dizzyingly romantic love story that will appeal to any filmgoer.
27567	3	a	The Cornetto Trilogy deserves to be studied in schools for many reasons, and The World's End doesn't let the team down.
27568	9	a	Gives Gigli serious competition for worst film of the year honors.
27569	6	a	... deeply undisciplined, and it undercuts its own best instincts in ways I find almost unbearably frustrating.
27570	2	a	This is the kind of film that Depp loves, understands, and unfurls his nastiest acting regalia for.
27571	1	a	Is there a better actress currently working in movies today than Amy Adams?
27572	3	a	This one's coming in under the radar. Keep an eye out...Best of all is Wilson, digging into his juiciest role in years.
27573	3	a	[Grant] is a brilliant comedian, with an ability to be hilariously selfish and egocentric without turning off the audience.
27574	6	a	Though the Elm Street series contains the most intelligent premise in current genre films, none of the movies take much advantage of their potential.
27575	0	a	'Rango' is one of the best works of literature I've enjoyed for many years. 'Rango' is one of the best family films I've seen in years. 'Rango' is one of the best Westerns I've ever seen.
27576	6	a	Lawrence Kasdan's Darling Companion is one of those motion pictures I wish I liked more than I actually do.
27577	0	a	The film is one of the year's best.
27578	4	a	The inscrutability of the performances make Bill Murray look like Anthony Quinn.
27579	3	a	[A] working class tragedy of mythic proportions, bristling with the inchoate rage of an underclass that . . . wouldn't know how to look up even if it knew that it could
27580	9	a	Dreary and instantly forgettable.
27581	2	a	Substituting charm, and sometimes quirk, for special effects, the no-budget time-travel caper Safety Not Guaranteed squeaks by on goodwill and guarded expectations.
27582	3	a	If John Hughes had gone on to make a smart LGBT coming-of-age charmer, most likely it would resemble this.
27583	2	a	It's a little too silly to sustain a significant character journey, but 'The To Do List' is still a successful overload of nostalgic and incredibly raunchy humor. 
27584	0	a	This is a masterpiece.
27585	5	a	Because of the lacklustre rom-com script and flaccid direction - not to mention the terror on kids' faces with the snarling wolves slaughtering stampeding caribou - wait to howl with the DVD.
27586	4	a	A solid, if somewhat stiff, adaptation of a terrific play.
27587	4	a	While this modest film certainly isn't the equal of Monsoon Wedding in humor, insight or character development, it is fun.
27588	6	a	...one of the least effective Crichton adaptations to date.
27589	3	a	MacFarlane gets away with comic murder in A Million Ways to Die, and he does it by being a little bit naughty and a little bit raunchy. But most of all, by being adorably cute. In a bad boy sort of way.
27590	5	a	Team the acting and writing of Seth Rogen and Evan Goldberg with the artsy-fartsy directing of Michel Gondry and they'd turn Gone with the Wind into a quirky comedy.
27591	3	a	Lazin's remarkable achievement is to catch Tupac in the act of discovering himself. It's something to see.
27592	9	a	Jonah Hex misfires. Repeatedly.
27593	4	a	A black-and-white novelty that plays like a directing-class exercise, you take your good with your bad with this one.
27594	5	a	Grade-C SoCal exploitation.
27595	5	a	A decent start can't save another run-of-the-mill romantic comedy snoozer.
27596	3	a	Its legend isn't really justified, but it's good
27597	4	a	Usher doesn't have the forceful, charismatic presence needed to convince as the ringleader of a group of such headstrong individuals.
27598	2	a	Got a spare six hours? Well, it would be a shame if you didn't, because this sweeping Italian drama is worth every minute.
27599	6	a	Seth Rogen's character should have evolved with humility and authenticity by relinquishing his bogus stranglehold as The Green Hornet and becoming The Guy Who Smokes a Fat Blunt Better Than You But Only Kicks Ass Like Your Great Grandma.
27600	6	a	Yawn; real fannish obsession can be much more absurd, and unsettlingly fascinating, than this burlesque ever gets.
27601	0	a	Blade Runner, in all its various, shimmering incarnations, is deathless.
27602	5	a	When you look at it again, the old film was not only superior but rather more radical. This St Trinian's looks as if it is aiming at the lowest common denominator, and finding it too often.
27603	2	a	A well-structured vehicle that delivers an enjoyable and entertaining ride.
27604	2	a	Think of it less as a deconstruction of philosophies, and more like an episode of Last Comic Standing where the jokesters are Nietzsche, Heidegger and Kant.
27605	9	a	It's one thing that the script has a moronic premise. It's another that the writers don't have anything clever to add to that premise.
27606	6	a	The Soloist illustrates Nathaniel's internal life -- his music and his madness -- in reductive, sensational imagery.
27607	4	a	Soul Power is worth seeing -- and hearing -- for the evocation of an era and above all, for the exuberant and infectious performances.
27608	2	a	Well-crafted, ably told and manages to connect with its earnest good intentions and desire to please.
27609	8	a	A movie for morons that is offensive on so many levels. It is loud, profane and profoundly stupid. One has to question how a film so awful could even be made, it is that bad. Most regrettably, it is not funny, not even a tiny bit.
27610	9	a	Big-budget, big-effects tale of men and machines has a tiny imagination and a robo-crafted soul.
27611	1	a	The film is painful viewing, in large part because director Amy Berg relates the facts and depicts the victims and the culprits with detached gravity.
27612	2	a	It's difficult to separate A Most Wanted Man from its central performance, to watch the film without seeing it as an affirmation of Hoffman's singular gifts, of his ability to create a fragile yet powerful character caught between dedication and despair.
27613	6	a	The movie lacks intensity while covering one of the most dramatic constitutional crises that befell the nation.
27614	8	a	This will probably be the worst film of the year - that people will like.
27615	3	a	Just like he did in Man on Wire, James Marsh tells this story in a fluid and organic manner. [Full review in Portuguese]
27616	6	a	Lacks the ideal clarity that best supports what is incredibly caustic material. It's a misfire for Jenkins, but an interesting failure.
27617	6	a	Beyond a Reasonable Doubt is a ludicrous story, very hard to swallow. Lang, who should have known better, must have directed this with his good eye closed.
27618	9	a	"Mary Shelley, this is not. ""I, Frankenstein"" is a bland mess of a film with nothing going on upstairs and not a thing to separate it from the wave of dreary, likeminded sci-fi/action exercises."
27619	4	a	Get past the togas and its somewhat stately pace, and here lies a movie with a timely message about the perils of religious intolerance.
27620	3	a	Even the most cynical are likely to be won over by the unassuming charms of Paper Heart.
27621	3	a	You have to give everyone involved credit for mounting a joke that, if not of Dadaist proportions, should prove pretty funny to everyone except the rubes who wander in expecting to see something they can comprehend.
27622	3	a	Spielberg effortlessly centres on the human drama amid the astounding imagery. So it's a pity the adaptation of HG Wells' classic novel becomes so contrived.
27623	2	a	Having sampled London and Barcelona in recent films, Woody Allen continues his grand tour of European cities with Midnight in Paris, an ingratiating, tourist-oriented exercise in nostalgia for a city that doesn't exist.
27624	6	a	Personally, I found it to be a mess -- a jumble of half-formed thoughts and ideas that amount to very little.
27625	5	a	"Silent Hill is like an endurance test to get to the ""'truth', but it's ultimately a gyp because it still doesn't make sense when you get there."
27626	0	a	Lancaster pulls out all the stops in one of his most memorable roles as the lustful, ambitious charlatan of Sinclair Lewis's powerful novel.
27627	4	a	A thoughtful and satisfying look at the ways we choose or refuse to take responsibility for our lives.
27628	0	a	Oyelowo is sensational in Selma. He makes you believe, body and soul, heart and mind, in his performance as Martin Luther King.
27629	2	a	All in all, Basic Instinct is a film that should be viewed as nothing more than a good example of Hollywood craftsmanship.
27630	0	a	It is hilarious, heartwarming and an absolute delight from beginning to end.
27631	4	a	Who knew that marionettes could be so tender, crude and aggressive in the bedroom?
27632	3	a	These characters demonstrate that just because your search was fruitless doesn't mean the trip isn't worthwhile.
27633	4	a	Parts of the movie are brilliant in a Terrence Malick-inspired way, but the lugubrious middle section is badly in need of the hand of a ruthless editor.
27634	9	a	The movie spends too much time off the set of Psycho, where the real story was, and focuses instead on incidental matters that feel like outtakes.
27635	0	a	The best Superman. Great villains and great Clark insecurity subplot.
27636	3	a	Quite simply, this Focker has us laughing out loud frequently and abundantly.
27637	3	a	Greene may have known his ceiling; thankfully, Cheadle recognizes no such boundaries. The man just keeps exploring the outer limits of his talent.
27638	7	a	Next Friday, after its midway mark, just lumbers until it fizzles out.
27639	6	a	Despite Cage and Sinise's failings, the investigation of the murder is very intriguing...for a while.
27640	2	a	Tupac's evolution as an artist showed us a young man who was an activist, involved in the community, who showed signs of becoming a more self-aware and self-critical artist, as his music moved from the political to the personal. 
27641	9	a	When not bludgeoning a business rival with an ax, well-heeled killer Patrick Bateman bludgeons the audience with the film's messages.
27642	6	a	"It treats its characters as placeholders for philosophical arguments and spends the majority of its running time trying to ""solve"" existential mysteries without adequately exploring them."
27643	1	a	The Edge of Seventeen is a dialogue delight, an enjoyably funny romp through the emotional and social minefields of high school adolescence.
27644	4	a	Peter Landesmen's Mark Felt: The Man Who Brought Down The White House at least offers a fresh perspective on a very familiar story.
27645	3	a	The result is a sweet, silly and sad film that is the comedy of the summer, a quiet ode to Britishness and the pub, and to the unshakeable notion that nothing will come between a man and his pint.
27646	0	a	What makes the film so magical is the extraordinary delicacy, formal daring and insight with which Guadagnino tackles such familiar material.
27647	4	a	Interesting performance from Johnny Depp, the world's best character actor
27648	6	a	The Rover's primary fault lies in its uncharismatic anti-hero.
27649	0	a	A full package of entertainment.
27650	4	a	Nobody's gonna mistake this trip down predictable lane as Shakespeare.
27651	4	a	Silver Linings Playbook remains a very classy, acceptably funny slice of comic drama. But that eventual cop-out feels deeply unsatisfactory.
27652	2	a	"Though the plot is almost formulaic, ""Country Strong"" has two things going for it: talented actors and great music"
27653	9	a	On the whole this is dismal fare ...
27654	8	a	Raise your hand if you think 'It's A Wonderful Life' is mushy, sentimental, over-praised hokum. Now, go to your room. Both of you.
27655	8	a	Vibrant, visceral, provocative and transporting.
27656	2	a	A deft, old-fashioned combination of jokes and sentiment, the cinematic equivalent of one of Crystal's opening monologues at the Academy Awards.
27657	4	a	Easily Lawrence's best starring role. But keep in mind that's only compared to his other movies.
27658	1	a	Easily Woody Allen's most enjoyable work since Small Time Crooks and his most lovely since Everyone Says I Love You.
27659	5	a	The gore piles up into ridiculous overkill.
27660	6	a	Plays like a compendium of summer blockbusters.
27661	6	a	Slapstick stunts, silliness, and shallow sentiment, with little else to satisfy moviegoers who want more than Cuba Gooding Jr. falling down and mugging for the camera.
27662	3	a	The film is a deeply compassionate, decidedly secular and somewhat plodding meditation on what matters now and what lies beyond this life.
27663	3	a	Symbols of a waning era who eventually clash over right and wrong, Messrs. McCrea and Scott mesh perfectly, with the latter getting the drollest lines -- and there are plenty.
27664	9	a	Charmless and brainless.
27665	2	a	By no means a classic, or capable of making much of a stir on the actual Internet, this animated sequel is coded to entertain, and that it does.
27666	3	a	The pacing is lively, yet still easy to follow
27667	4	a	Fun, but the least of Smith's Jay and Silent Bob films.
27668	4	a	Black or White is a heartwarming film on the barriers of race, but it's also a deeply moving film about what it means to be family
27669	2	a	Like Albert himself, the film isn't showy, but it's got quality and heart.
27670	4	a	It's honourable, it's well-intentioned, but it's lame.
27671	4	a	We know what comic book movies are capable of being. They can have greatness in them. Fantastic Four has nothing more than okay-ness.
27672	9	a	almost despicably lazy storytelling... Director / screenwriter Patty Jenkins has tried to humanize a despicable person, and she is completely ineffective at doing that.
27673	1	a	[T]he real surprise of The World's End is the wounded heart beating underneath the gags.
27674	5	a	Hits on notes lower than the Smuggler's Blues.
27675	5	a	Why would I want any of these jerks to be happy?
27676	6	a	If nothing else, the film serves as a cringeworthy reminder to us all about what terrible people we were in high school.
27677	4	a	A documentary with a varied group of Americans talking about solutions to the very-real crisis of climate change.
27678	6	a	More interested in the sins of the guilty than their effect on the innocent.
27679	3	a	One of the things that is most intriguing about The Break-Up is how it shows the cruelty that people can inflict upon one another as soon as love fades.
27680	3	a	Truth be told, this may be Aniston's best work on either the big or small screen, and it's certainly a far cry from her character on the hit NBC sitcom.
27681	7	a	Mark Felt: The Man Who Brought Down the White House is a frantic, over-detailed yawn.
27682	2	a	Perry tosses in comedic moments when the tension gets too intense, but he doesn't do it at the sake of any of the characters. This is a movie about five interesting -- and funny -- women dealing with real world problems.
27683	2	a	It's all so delightfully over-the-top that it could only be disliked by persons approaching it as a serious drama.
27684	3	a	It's a beautifully shot, beautifully acted piece of fluff.
27685	7	a	At best, Larry Crowne is laughably inept and anachronistic. At worst, it's propaganda. 
27686	5	a	This film is the least of the three: it lacks the novelty of the first film and the cleverly morbid humor of the second one.
27687	3	a	There were one too many contrivances down the stretch, but it's no surprise that Three Billboards has been talked about as one of the year's best films. 
27688	4	a	Sweet and moving as it often manages to be, the film is comfortingly average, in its way - the point of it not to stand out, but fit in.
27689	2	a	The several genuine laughs are enough to make up for any lulls and non sequiturs
27690	9	a	Mutant Chronicles is as atrocious as its terrible title suggests - but one redemptive aspect to this based-on- a-role-play-game snooze-fest is its ambitious visual flair.
27691	0	a	With its rusty railroads and dingy metal canisters where the downtrodden dwell, [the movie] finds color, surprise, and joy in the simplicity of these struggling Helsinki outcasts.
27692	1	a	A sad, fascinating, and profoundly moving portrait of two individuals who have learned, not by choice, to live together.
27693	3	a	"For those of us who thought Diesel and Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson were ""separated at birth,"" these two have a best-of-the-baldies throwdown that rocks our action loving world."
27694	4	a	Ang Lee captures the spirit of this memorable cultural event as the coming of age of a young man who accidentally facilitated it, but Michael Wadleigh's documentary is the richer Woodstock experience.
27695	3	a	With near-Swiss precision, director/producer Jay Roach ... and his writers make sure familiarity breeds hilarity.
27696	4	a	Shankman drops the ball at the finish line, jettisoning the tough-love fun for cheap sentimentality.
27697	3	a	Must Love Dogs ... unleashes snappy, smart dialogue that's good enough to make us want to sit and stay. 
27698	3	a	A very impressive synthesis of personal filmmaking and epic aspiration.
27699	5	a	History buffs and Civil War re-enactors may find this painfully long-winded epic a gem worth exploring but others will most likely prefer to go dancing in the active battlefields of Fredricksburg as opposed to enduring this detached costume drama.
27700	5	a	This indie squib wobbles briefly on a tightrope between sincerity and cuteness before plunging headlong to a death-by-whimsy.
27701	6	a	There are some humorous observations, irrefutable truths and good performances that make this movie worthwhile to those in a man-bashing mindframe.
27702	3	a	If you've ever been hopelessly in love - and who among us hasn't? - you'll likely recognize some part of yourself in the unrealistic but upbeat Doris.
27703	6	a	Jenkins' brushstrokes of her characters are too exacting to move us more than a lifelike painting of a basket of fruit. We can be awed at the techniques, but walk away empty.
27704	3	a	Resoundingly received with dramatic urgency--hauntingly involving in its depiction of the scarred psyches of journalists. Pike gives a powerful and revealing performance as the late Colvin that embraced her high-risk occupation with abrasive enthusiasm
27705	6	a	[The filmmakers] can handle cheap gags and visuals, but story, character, dialogue, even a consistent tone are entirely out of their grasp.
27706	0	a	George Lucas and Steven Spielberg's classic movie did not invent adventure, as it was largely inspired by old serials, pulp magazines and B-movies, but it certainly revamped our conception of big screen adventure.
27707	3	a	It's a neat progression for Disney that finds balance between the studio's old-school charm and Pixar's dynamic modern outlook.
27708	2	a	Director Brad Furman is smart to focus on Bob - on Cranston, really - whose skill and decency keep us invested even when the story gets murky.
27709	3	a	Controversial epic with brutality, sex. Mature teens only.
27710	9	a	This is Hollywood at its dumbest.
27711	4	a	Though he's highly irresponsible, this Alfie is not quite a calculating heel, which makes the material go down easier while blunting the point.
27712	7	a	Rock the Kasbah, does not rock at all - not even a little bit.
27713	3	a	The performances, and chemistry, are great and there is much to enjoy in a My Week With Marilyn kind of way.
27714	0	a	A masterpiece of dystopian science fiction on film.
27715	4	a	Like the recent The Theory of Everything, The Imitation Game does a better job with the historical bullet points than with the interior lives of its characters.
27716	3	a	A new documentary offers a salutary and touching reminder that the race, like nearly everything else great about New York City, was the creation of a stubborn visionary.
27717	3	a	A superb thriller and a worthy biopic of a real hero.
27718	7	a	Gibson may have given us the most profitable version of this story ever made, but he's also given us the most amateurish, absurd, politically suspect and obsessively violent.
27719	3	a	The best Disney fantasy-musical since Mary Poppins, a hilarious, dazzling send-up of the thing that made Disney what it is today fairy-tale princesses.
27720	5	a	"If you're familiar with the ""Firefly"" characters, you'll enjoy the episodic action far more than those who aren't."
27721	2	a	One of the more entertaining Bond films.
27722	4	a	Joseph's cynicism and wit are communicated with the spot-on casting of Kline, and Keaton ably conveys Beth's suppressed loneliness as well as her big heart.
27723	6	a	In eschewing the use of a narrator or talking heads, Morgen leaves out too much crucial information.
27724	1	a	An important film.
27725	1	a	This is a bold follow-up to Hustle and Flow. Would that more filmmakers and actors took these kinds of risks.
27726	2	a	One of the things that happens while you watch a man slowly beaten to death is that the fact of his life is reinforced. This happened, Gibson is saying.
27727	1	a	Captures the tension of trying to stand out in cookie-cutter world without alienating everyone around you.
27728	6	a	There's nothing special or memorable about this overlong endeavor, the first of two motion pictures to feature Bing Crosby's insufferably noble Father Chuck O'Malley.
27729	2	a	Sometimes the lamest ideas translate into the funniest films, and Galaxy Quest is a perfect example of this strange paradox.
27730	5	a	Smothered by its own solemnity.
27731	6	a	The characters and script are strictly by-the-numbers and the sentimental goo that justifies the mayhem is poured on thick.
27732	9	a	The film was adapted from a short story, and perhaps a short story it should have stayed.
27733	8	a	Beetlejuice is so memorable and iconic because Burton took chances and dared to be different. 
27734	1	a	It's a portrayal of great power yet moving stillness, and heartfelt humour combined with a ferocious will, as Mildred will not give up and will not stop.
27735	0	a	Doesn't dally around and far more action-packed than the first.
27736	4	a	Kevin James' slapstick comedy will amuse older tweens.
27737	1	a	Crazy enough to entertain while illuminating the sad reality of never quite getting what you want.
27738	6	a	The feel-good Seyfried movie of the year -- though that's not such a hard feat when your two other yearly releases include a Nicholas Sparks weepie and a twisted Atom Egoyan psycho-thriller. 
27739	2	a	This smart doc should prove the perfect summer antidote to most of summer's films that require you to turn your brain off to enjoy them.
27740	5	a	Aliens In The Attic is boring. Not just humdrum but deathly dull, as in stick-it-in-a-rocket-and-blast-it-into-space uninteresting.
27741	4	a	Interesting sci-fi film. Not really successful, but worth a look.
27742	9	a	A joyless hatchet job.
27743	6	a	It won't win any awards, but it's not a bad evening out.
27744	4	a	Technical spectacle amounts do nothing without a good story.
27745	3	a	This is an old-fashioned, frankly formulaic star vehicle built for two, and it brings out the best, or at least the most appealing, in its pampered passengers.
27746	4	a	You might not want to stick by it in sickness and in health, 'til death do you part, but it's a reasonable enough companion for a night out at the cinema.
27747	5	a	It is an exasperatingly unfocused and underpowered movie that, like Churchill's famous themeless pudding, is unsure what it is supposed to be about.
27748	9	a	An insufferable hodgepodge of phallic and fecal humor.
27749	0	a	It's a rocket to the moon fueled by unadulterated joy and pure imagination.
27750	1	a	The only Truth is that the quest to reclaim the best of what we were disillusions us. . . before it kills us.
27751	9	a	Oh my lord. Can we say Derivative Crapfest? Horrible acting, and a script that takes sci-fi/fantasy elements and tosses them in a blender
27752	2	a	It's a brilliantly conceived trajectory performed with powerful conviction by Hawke. But a little subtlety [from Schrader] would have gone a long way.
27753	6	a	A ham-fisted movie that doesn't tax your brain with a lot of pesky ideas and three-dimensional characters.
27754	8	a	The style and substance of the story never gel right, instead bubbling over in a sticky concoction of self-importance, faulty reasoning and crass immaturity.
27755	3	a	Surprisingly smart, cool-looking, nicely paced and well-acted.
27756	9	a	[The Wayanses] collaborate on another forgettable farce drenched in vapid vulgarity...[a] pea-brained prank. Anyone game for White Chicks II?
27757	5	a	"Jolie's role in this film is somewhere between femme fatale and Girl from Ipanema -- she spends a lot of time walking slowly while those she passes say, ""Ahhhhhhh."" "
27758	4	a	While enjoyable, this is probably the most overrated Bond movie.
27759	3	a	A Woody Allen classic with Paris as an enchanting backdrop, some appealing characters, and a potpourri of witty one-liners. 
27760	5	a	"As the principal says, ""I'm not sure we're trying to help someone here, or whether you're using him as a glorified mascot."" Exactly."
27761	5	a	A distinctly mixed bag, the occasional bursts of sharp writing alternating with lots of sloppiness and the obligatory moments of sentimental ooze.
27762	6	a	There's real potential in this premise for a ripping screwball comedy anchored by two likeable actors, but the filmmakers simply don't trust the material, stirring in constant elements of action mayhem that don't work at all.
27763	2	a	Gibson makes many of the key scenes work.
27764	1	a	Logan Lucky embodies so much of what's made Steven Soderbergh that rare journeyman between arthouse and multiplex.
27765	3	a	The movie's remaining revelations build slowly into a set of surprisingly powerful emotional beats.
27766	2	a	For the most part, it's a genial pleasure, with something disarmingly daggy -- intentional or not -- about its vision of history and individual experience.
27767	3	a	Life, death and a love that burns bright and brief as a firefly... Only Fincher could lighten up and still turn in a film obsessed with transience, with mortality. Flecked with flaws, Button nonetheless stands as a monument to its maker's talent.
27768	4	a	Delivers rare insight about kids growing up at different speeds ... If only the movie didn't so frequently turn reality into a literal and figurative cartoon.
27769	5	a	For the most part, Black's dialogue lacks its usual vim, and he directs with way too much abandon, rushing from one high-pitched set-piece to the next so breathlessly that there's no time to engage or get excited.
27770	3	a	"Splendidly pert dialogue, laugh-out-loud situations, and an ensemble of ready and willing performers combine to ultimately give ""I Give It a Year"" the volt of electricity it needs to keep from becoming familiar and obvious."
27771	3	a	One of the finest Australian films of all time. The laughs don't stop.
27772	3	a	The latest film from pugnacious director/writer Paul Schrader is as austere and revelatory as a church confessional...It's a bleak portrait of a man in the midst of a spiritual breakdown that is only slightly undone by its rather unsatisfying conclusion.
27773	6	a	If director Werner Herzog can do it with 'Rescue Dawn' and 'Little Dieter Needs to Fly,' why can't director Benson Lee?
27774	6	a	Both lovers are duplicitous creeps -- in a perverse way they're made for each other.
27775	5	a	This film seems blissfully unaware that political obstructionists are paralyzing the legislative process; that deep-pocketed influence peddlers have a vested interest in maintaining the fossil fuel culture; that, in general, people resist change.
27776	0	a	Napoleon's climactic spaz-out dance is more than just a goofy gag. It's a payoff to a great buddy-system comedy and the idea that it's not high school's dreams and regrets that last, but the sometimes-bizarre friendships.
27777	4	a	Cool to look at, but there's nothing to it.
27778	0	a	Justine is flawed like all the rest of us, and Aniston brings this humanity to the forefront, creating one of the most realistic heroines in recent history.
27779	1	a	...a notable dramedy, a film that never takes the easy path, and develops its story in an emotionally honest way... [Full review in Spanish]
27780	6	a	Quest skirts dangerously close to being the thing it parodies: a second-rate space opera.
27781	4	a	A solidly built, rather old-fashioned yarn about a plucky underdog who triumphs in the face of adversity.
27782	2	a	The sad reality of aging and the picture of adults who still need a push in the right direction are rarely so keenly observed and honestly delivered.
27783	7	a	full review in Greek
27784	4	a	John Dahl's Joy Ride is a hick thriller tailor-made for the Scream crowd.
27785	4	a	Paul Thomas Anderson is here to honor everything Thomas Pynchon and Inherent Vice are about, without dumbing the narrative down to draw a wider audience.
27786	3	a	"Eat Pray Love"" rests on Roberts' talented shoulders. Her appeal and personality overcome most of the film's defects, including a too-long running time, and some platitudes and words of wisdom that sound as if they were written by Hallmark."
27787	4	a	Letters to Juliet is a guilty pleasure for the ladies, perfect Blu-ray fodder when their significant others turn them into World of Warcraft widows for the evening.
27788	5	a	Call Me By Your Name thinks about cruising and playing games, but never makes up its mind.
27789	5	a	The animation bar has been raised, and not just by Pixar. Poor little Astro Boy hasn't a prayer of clearing it.
27790	3	a	A very tough, very real film, anchored by the memorable work of the two leads.
27791	9	a	Oh, what stupid people these are.
27792	3	a	Warm and fuzzy despite its frigid locale, Arctic Tale is the huggable nature film many people expected from March of the Penguins, but didn't get.
27793	6	a	People die, cars collide, things get blown sky high. But none of it feels at all suspenseful. Lin is much better at comedy relief, which includes a sexy con by Gadot, who beats the all-hands drug czar at his own game.
27794	6	a	Though Bullock and Grant more than pass their chemistry test, Two Weeks Notice isn't much of a movie.
27795	4	a	American Dreamz is often a lot of fun, thanks to Weitz's cast.
27796	4	a	A long trip, but worth the wait. Paul Chambers, CNN.
27797	6	a	As Ayers, a Juilliard-trained cellist reduced to homelessness, Foxx turns The Soloist from a mildly effective inspirational tale into an aggressive awards-season advertisement.
27798	3	a	Delicately woven and sensitively told, director-writer Joshua Z Weinstein's ode to a shlemiel rings true.
27799	4	a	The performances the main cast delivers are what stands out most of this film. Portman is believable, Joel Edgerton is not that charismatic and Ewan McGregor is an interesting villain. [Full review in Spanish]
27800	9	a	Evidently, the wrong turn I made was in the multiplex.
27801	6	a	While stipulating that at its core it's fairly slight, and also constructed of prefabricated parts, this is a deeply but pleasantly weird sort of Southern Gothic battle royale.
27802	9	a	It's better than the Roger Corman version, but that's not saying much.
27803	3	a	A model of purposefulness; a movie rich, but not lost, in background detail and fair-minded in its account of Thatcherite woes to the working class.
27804	3	a	For one of the smartest films I've seen in a while, Cosmopolis is also one of the least outwardly enjoyable. That by no means makes it anything less than a great film however.
27805	4	a	At this point, there've been so many boxing movies that we really are hoping someone finds a unique approach.Bleed for This is not that movie. It is still a worthwhile watch, however, if only for the unbelievable comeback story it resurrects.
27806	4	a	Christopher Robin may be gloomier than past Pooh pursuits, but its message of personal redemption is considerably deeper.
27807	1	a	It is both straightforward and abstract, using cinematic tricks to put the audience in Sam/Henry's headspace. The result is a bit a sense of intentional vertigo that may cloud the films ultimately humanist point.
27808	4	a	The movie proves you can go home again. But it will take a better sequel to decide whether you want to.
27809	6	a	Producer Sean S. Cunningham and cronies have wisely given up trying to scare us with this series.
27810	9	a	A bikini-clad morality tale, one so simplistic and preposterous that even the sharks know they should munch only on the villains.
27811	3	a	The true measure of Freudenthal's film is that it's the rare kid's flick that their parents won't have to merely tolerate. Rather, they will enjoy it, too.
27812	5	a	While this is the best in the franchise since the first film, I still don't like it because watching Vin Diesel in anything makes me want to punch myself in the face...and that's just not healthy. 
27813	5	a	Cosmopolis is a soulless, confusing, bore of a film, a pretentious message movie where the message itself is lost in dialogue equal to verbal masturbation where big questions are asked, and waffling diatribes are given in response.
27814	0	a	A barn burner, a bracing shot of whiskey downed while spoiling for a fight, a cathartic wail against the zeitgeist of rape culture and state brutality. It's a rallying cry, a right hook to the jaw, and wow, does it ever hurt so good.
27815	2	a	An entertaining comic nightmare, but like most bad dreams, it disappears once the lights come up.
27816	0	a	"This is one of those movies I can imagine deciding is a masterpiece in a month's time. And by any measure, ""Into the Wild"" is a big leap forward for Penn as a director and deserves to be one of the most talked about films of the season."
27817	4	a	Theron's against-type role is an utterly committed, completely unself-conscious and thoroughly convincing portrayal of an unsavory character.
27818	6	a	A summer movie that offers sporadic thrills and spills with nothing but dead air surrounding them.
27819	5	a	It's not the worst thing out there, but the running time is too much and more than just curiosity doesn't really hold up as a great movie. [Full review in Spanish]
27820	3	a	By this point, the phrase 'Un Film de Almodovar' connotes a genre unto itself, as identifiable by its themes, character types and visual trademarks as a Western, Hammer horror movie or vintage screwball comedy.
27821	3	a	You get that Penn is more interested in commenting on what's happening in the U.S. today and what an appropriate individual response might be in a country he probably believes has lost its way. The answer, however, is blowin' in the wind. 
27822	4	a	At least as entertaining as the remake. Probably better.
27823	1	a	An undervalued gem ripening and enduring with age and perspective, destined for rediscovery.
27824	4	a	It almost works.
27825	2	a	There's so much to enjoy and appreciate about this movie, especially after the awful Rock the Kasbah.
27826	1	a	Treads some of the same territory as Fight Club, but it is a much more cohesive, darkly funny experience than its unconvincing Hollywood predecessor.
27827	5	a	If you're part of the group that's been anticipating this movie for more than five years, it may be a bit of a letdown.
27828	4	a	Director Terence Young never quite solves the pacing problems posed by filming underwater, but John Stears's Oscar-winning special effects more than compensate.
27829	0	a	I love Star Wars more, but strictly speaking, this is probably a better film.
27830	3	a	My recommendation is tempered by the fact that this started off as a great movie and ended as little more than a piece of pleasant fluff.
27831	5	a	If you like boxing or know a little something about the sport, prepare to have your intelligence insulted.
27832	3	a	"Not to be confused with ""The Illusionist,"" although it will be, is ""The Prestige,"" the second period piece about magicians to hit the big screen within the last few weeks."
27833	4	a	A sun-dappled road-trip ramble rich in the buttery wonders of French cuisine and whisper-light on storyline.
27834	3	a	An intelligent, well-acted popcorn movie, a little smarter and more sly than most summer offerings.
27835	6	a	it goes without saying that McDormand is the high point of Laurel Canyon. She tears through the stiff, paper-thin movie with a sense of complete freedom, the same way Geena Davis did in The Accidental Tourist.
27836	4	a	If Early Man were an Olympic competitor, it wouldn't be breaking any records but would easily qualify for a third-place medal.
27837	4	a	Scenes go on and on in endless, witless dialogue, ever accompanied by John Williams' hideously gushing music.
27838	6	a	TV movie level fluff. Yawn.
27839	4	a	It remains an expertly assembled companion piece to its source material, with charms you can't overlook. But the great Harry Potter should be casting a more powerful spell.
27840	5	a	Unfortunately, it only hints at the real fire the purple one brings to his shows.
27841	4	a	Despite the fact that this is a beautifully-shot, dryly funny period drama, some audiences might prefer to stick to the sheer escapism of Austen's fictional work, which follows a similar formula.
27842	4	a	Susanna White's biographical drama is a little traditional and occasionally a little stiff, but the growing relationship between Weldon and Sitting Bull at its center offers rich emotional rewards. 
27843	3	a	Steve Martin is at the height of his comic powers in this very un-PC comedy.
27844	7	a	Sluggishly directed by episodic TV veteran Joe Zwick, it's a sitcom without the snap-crackle.
27845	1	a	[Team America: World Police is] a roller coaster ride that works most of the time and keeps the laughs coming.
27846	2	a	"The movie's storyline as a whole fits in really well with the rest of the series, and it does a great job of paying homage to the original ""Predator"" movie by starting out in a jungle-like setting."
27847	4	a	The stars execute their silly romantic-comedy dance steps as if to the manner born, but it is the funny shuffle-and-halt tango between Bartha's computer nerd and Deschanel's man-proof misanthrope that add some real zest.
27848	4	a	This film is pure excess that's almost definitely motivated by studio greed, but it's light entertainment that will please fans, and Andy Serkis damn-near runs away with the film during his exemplary third-act appearance as Gollum.
27849	5	a	There may be some way to make this nonsense amusing, but writers Kristen Buckley and Brian Regan haven't even figured out a reasonable setup for getting the two together.
27850	4	a	In the end [it] tells us we shouldn't depend on each other... we should be glad that 'we have ourselves.' What a lonely and sad conclusion.
27851	3	a	Rourke's greatest achievement is the performances she's coaxed out of her two lead actresses. They're so good they're like De Niro and Pacino in Heat. 
27852	2	a	As demonic children movies go, it?s really not bad -- and the acting makes it seem a little better than that.
27853	6	a	A decent, well acted film with some beautiful shots. Too bad is not a well made story. [Full review in Spanish]
27854	4	a	[A] moderately engaging pseudo-Brit-lit piffle.
27855	4	a	We do see New York from some interestingly different angles and Jack goes on a voyage which might inspire others like him.
27856	3	a	Woody Allen received well deserved Oscar nods as writer and director of this original b/w comedy about a talent agent down on his luck.
27857	6	a	...yet another routine action thriller designed to showcase the star appeal of Tom Cruise.
27858	5	a	an intriguing near-miss rather than the unintentional laugh-fest that Harlin's version proved to be
27859	3	a	The nicest movie in theaters right now is 'Our Little Sister.' That's not to say it's not sad or dark or that its characters can't be prickly and neurotic.
27860	6	a	Crimson Peak is gorgeous, there's no denying that fact, but del Toro's Gothic facade hides a hollow, unbalanced foundation that begins to crumble under such immense visual weight.
27861	4	a	Fanboys ambles along on a decent sprinkling of chuckles. The tide of in-jokes are funny whether you get them or not because the real humor lies in how they reflect a fraternal code.
27862	2	a	Wright isn't a subtle filmmaker -- but he is a joyful one. Who wouldn't drink to that?
27863	4	a	...a decent little horror flick...
27864	4	a	Despite the movie's lack of narrative discipline, it grows on you, in part because it's so easy to identify with these characters.
27865	2	a	Identity Theft is perfectly performed, often wildly funny, and a great movie night option for the not-easily-embarrassed.
27866	3	a	Pooh's Heffalump Movie is the cinematic equivalent of being tucked into bed with a fable and a glass of water.
27867	4	a	Why spend money to go see this? When you could just stay home and watch reruns of Ned's Declassified for free?
27868	3	a	The result is a gripping, forceful example of documentary filmmaking.
27869	7	a	Watch carefully as the film tries to ramrod too many themes, invoking split-screen technique, and see if you can identify how often self-indulgence is confused for enlightenment.
27870	9	a	Just Getting Started simply never does get started. It's D.O.A.
27871	3	a	Disney satirizes its own princess megabusiness -- but still goes for the standard payoffs -- with this funny story of a fairy-tale heroine who finds herself in real-life New York City.
27872	9	a	An eheis tin ypomoni na parakoloythiseis gia miamisi ora tin poiitiki epanaliptikotita toy skinotheti poy einai asygkratitos oso pote sti mizeria poy petaei stoys iroes toy, mporei mesa ston aparadekto iho, ti ftini fotografia kai tin aneleita koyrastiki
27873	1	a	An uneven movie that nonetheless bristles with stinging wit and exerts a perverse fascination.
27874	4	a	Instead of telling the intimate story of one woman's steadfast perseverance against impossible, imposing forces Disney opts for the bland inspirational triumph template.
27875	2	a	Hollywood's motivation for trying to cash in on a hot title is clear. It's not so easy to divine [David] Fincher's reasons for signing on.
27876	9	a	Ay-yi-yi, Frankenstein.
27877	3	a	Pixar has delivered its first pure action picture, while still managing not to lose sight of its preoccupation with family.
27878	3	a	Hopkins catches the essence of Hitchcock as artist and con man. And Mirren is stellar as his wife and secret weapon. The pleasure of their company adds sparkle to this unexpectedly poignant look at a career and a marriage. 
27879	0	a	Vincent Gallo achieved something with this film that few first time directors have ever done.
27880	4	a	It's asking a lot for a child actor like Gordon to do the man's portion of this job - to somehow make Heffley's selfishness and failure seem funny. Unfortunately, Seth Rogen is probably a little old for this role.
27881	5	a	"Paranoid Park"" may be the best of the director's last four films, but that isn't saying much."
27882	3	a	The Prestige is as entertaining as it is intricate and as enticingly mysterious as its title, which comes from the professional magician's lexicon.
27883	3	a	It's not always easy to sort out the legitimately inspired touches from the merely campy ones, but the film has a deranged, go-for-broke spirit that makes such distinctions irrelevant.
27884	6	a	"It might have been nice to actually have some kind of emotional response to it, in addition to just nodding and thinking, ""ah yes, this seems to be properly observed."
27885	6	a	Tired and dreary, the youngest of the Count's clan fails to measure up to his classic dad and his older sister.
27886	8	a	Today's block buster wannabes can't tell a simple straight forward story anymore. Everything has to be about building a mythology for future films, instead of focusing on the film you are currently making.
27887	4	a	An epic look at the intimate frustrations of two massively powerful young women who spend most of their energy navigating between who they are and what they represent.
27888	9	a	"If the ""Billion Dollar"" idea was to attract new viewers, someone should get their money back."
27889	3	a	Apresenta um visual arrebatador.
27890	2	a	"In its small, independent way, ""The Kings of Summer"" rules."
27891	9	a	Factory Girl's greatest crime is transforming a scene and a personality that were all about movement and flamboyant brilliance into nothing but inert ventriloquism.
27892	3	a	The first movie since Chasing Amy to successfully balance gentle romance and raunchy comedy.
27893	4	a	For all the didactic clumsiness of her story, Greenwald understands the richness and uncanny beauty of Appalachian music.
27894	6	a	A mystery whose secret is obvious from the beginning and a thriller without any genuine thrills.
27895	0	a	One of the most powerful examples of sacrifice one will see in this century.
27896	4	a	"Peter Pan"" redo has its moments with Hoffman and Williams."
27897	4	a	Talk about an impossible mission: Tom Cruise plays a German WWII Colonel with plans to assassinate Hitler in this distractingly anachronistic fact-based tale from Bryan Singer.
27898	2	a	The big-screen treatment allows the creators' vision to bloom in a way it could never quite do on the tube, but in essence the movie is an expanded episode of the show.
27899	2	a	Loads up on colors, cars and characters to distract from what's missing under the creative hood, yet this spirited sequel is fun as it rarely takes itself too seriously.
27900	1	a	A welcome throwback to blood-soaked espionage thrillers, The Bourne Supremacy is a gritty sequel that hasn't lost its popular appeal.
27901	3	a	A real classic.
27902	3	a	...the closest thing we've had in the last twenty years to a genuine Christmas classic.
27903	7	a	A mostly boring affair with no real scares or shocks ... the previous film, as bad as that was, was better than this.
27904	10	a	'Transylmania' LOOKS like a move. It's on film, after all, and it has a script and actors. But there the resemblance to any real movie ends. This tasteless mess should have been shuttled straight to DVD.
27905	1	a	Ms. Coppola is well on her way to becoming a talent in her own right, and Lost in Translation is a great next step in that journey.
27906	9	a	We should just throw pretense to the wind and call this one Jessica Alba In A Bikini. They're certainly not paying for her acting skills. 
27907	4	a	It is comically true to the major embarrassments and minor heroisms of middle school. Take it from me. I was there.
27908	1	a	Taken as a whole, it's a deeply affecting, incendiary film and the most focused, accomplished biopic in a year of numerous offerings.
27909	2	a	A worthwhile therapy session that all genders can enjoy.
27910	4	a	Lee captures the fractious, joyful, monstrously evolving mass it all was.
27911	2	a	McConaughey is funny and fearsome in the title role, the devil holding the family accountable for their choices.
27912	6	a	...an egregiously bland piece of work that ultimately makes certain sitcoms look deep by comparison.
27913	5	a	The reality is that for many, [these] four years are marked by a more moderate, complicated set of things, and not the relentless bleakness displayed in [the] film.
27914	2	a	It takes a very realistic approach to the depiction of the characters within the small town and their motivations.
27915	4	a	"David O. Russell continues to prove just how wacky a filmmaker he truly is. In ""'Huckabees"" the laughs are mixed, but the wackiness couldn't be more inspired."
27916	3	a	Next Friday is an extremely funny movie, and this is coming from someone who barely cracked a smile during Friday, the first installment of this franchise.
27917	5	a	A plasticky and often grating family comedy...
27918	1	a	Completely fresh, perhaps the best sci-fi film this year, and one of the better ones of any genre.
27919	2	a	You'd have to be in a really bad mood to be put off by this picture's admittedly kind of unabashed eagerness to please.
27920	4	a	Now and again, L'Auberge makes a leap. The light catches it just right, and up flashes a pleasing insight about the state of the European union.
27921	3	a	Matt Damon is at his most relatable best in a film that has heart, drama and passion
27922	3	a	Simply viewed as a movie about people, Torch Song Trilogy has the kind of wit, grace, and intense feeling that Woody Allen tried for unsuccessfully in Interiors, September, and Another Woman...
27923	1	a	Wizards may not be everyone's cup of tea, but it is an audacious refreshment that deserves appreciation and respect nonetheless
27924	9	a	Less about storytelling than depravity ...
27925	6	a	The laughs are sitcom shaped.
27926	8	a	The Texas Chainsaw Massacre: The Beginning relies on made-you-jump shocks and more fake entrails than a Jaycees haunted house.
27927	5	a	This is one of the more depressing films to come out this year.
27928	1	a	It's nimble, bright and funny. It doesn't dumb down. It doesn't patronize. It knows something about human nature. It isn't as good as A Christmas Story, as few movies are, but it deserves a place in the same sentence.
27929	7	a	A few inventive shocks are scattered throughout, but the rest is unremarkable madness, punctuated with a thriller-style conclusion that resembles another movie altogether.
27930	1	a	Dig down beneath those wintry grays, and Payne's latest is a wonderful and quietly life-affirming film about a dysfunctional family trying to get its act together
27931	6	a	Weak caper flick that's phony, superficial and unconvincing, that too slickly veers between comedy and suspense.
27932	2	a	I have mixed feelings for Ralph Breaks the Internet. I really wanted it to be as good as the first. Sadly, it's not, but it's still a good film.
27933	9	a	Now I remember why I keep hoping Pauly Shore never has a comeback.
27934	6	a	One twist too many. Or one too few.
27935	0	a	Romantic drama with Hepburn in good form.
27936	5	a	Amenabar's efforts to align the era's religious conflicts and culture wars with those of our own become thuddingly obvious, especially once the old-school brio of Agora's first hour has gone the way of the Roman Empire.
27937	3	a	It's a playful study of Arctic life, starring a polar bear cub, its prey, and a tagalong fox -- with the inevitable dramatic moments when bear meets walrus.
27938	3	a	Yes, [there are] enough nods to other sources to make Rango a bobblehead. But the movie, and much of John Logan's writing, is still pretty durn clever.
27939	4	a	Offers a message we've heard before, but it's one that bears repeating, and it's reasonably well delivered.
27940	6	a	...a cockeyed collection of watered-down, lowbrow parodies that have all the revered spark of a joy buzzer jolting an arthritic patient during a spontaneous handshake.
27941	6	a	It's intermittently fun, and funny, but after a while it's just so much swinging back and forth. We get it. You're up. You're down. You're back up again.
27942	6	a	By movie's end, I had whiplash from the movie's lurches between frivolity and seriousness.
27943	0	a	Where this brilliant production thrives most predominantly, is in the striking combination of comedy and drama, which has been seamlessly woven together.
27944	5	a	It's no 'American Pie.'
27945	6	a	A fine cast can't quite rise above a story without enough heart.
27946	3	a	One of the sweetest cinematic confections of the year. Charlyne Yi is a new star in the making.
27947	0	a	A visually thrilling experience.
27948	9	a	Juliette Binoche is unusually playful and loose as Pattinson's sex buddy, and Paul Giamatti's intensity briefly raises the movie's sharpness level. But I don't think they're enough to compensate for the film's general air of arch superiority.
27949	3	a	When a murder mystery stars Sean Penn, Tim Robbins, and Kevin Bacon you're gonna have a hard time picking the killer. Eastwood directs without a trace of showiness.
27950	2	a	Better than average rags-to-riches story, but expect to get pinched for a special edition DVD later.
27951	6	a	A film that creates certain feeling of distance or coldness, and even boredom. [Full review in Spanish]
27952	3	a	A quirky and bloody meditation on the rising tide of violence in America by the Coen brothers.
27953	4	a	Treacle, sickening sweet, but still a guilty pleasure for those with romance in their bones.
27954	4	a	Hopkins' Hitch may not reveal inner demons. He's entertaining, as is Mirren. It's fun to watch them elevate a rosy assessment of a first-rate popular artist and the woman who never got the credit she deserved.
27955	4	a	Sometimes cotton candy tastes really yummy, pop songs are fun for the ears, and movies like Hitch can make for a breezy good time.
27956	1	a	The film moves into psychedelic and violent territory, creating a perspective that is equally unreal and unforgettable.
27957	3	a	Inherent Vice locates a mystery worthy of Sam Spade and Philip Marlowe and basically sends in Cheech and Chong to crack the case.
27958	7	a	I would admire the atmosphere a lot more if it amounted to something scary, creepy or original.
27959	9	a	More than a film flirting with unwatchable, the music video sexiness of Wonderland is dangerous.
27960	0	a	Who'd have guessed that a silent movie would be the favorite for year-end awards?
27961	6	a	The Break-Up is much like a real relationship as it starts off all hilarious and fun, but you are tearing your hair out by the end.
27962	4	a	A strong film, with some genuinely revealing insights into the life of its charismatic and paradoxical subject.
27963	3	a	Depp and Jarmusch combine for something fairly bizarre, yet quietly rewarding.
27964	3	a	Though at first Cop Land seems as if it will be an ensemble piece, it is, in fact, Stallone's movie.
27965	5	a	Much of the humor feels tired and unfunny, and David Zucker's directing sags where it should zing.
27966	8	a	Jurassic Park remains an incredible experience - one that never ceases to be entertaining. It's not an entirely faithful adaptation of Michael Crichton's popular novel, but the creative liberties it takes prove enormously ingenious. 
27967	4	a	It's frustrating, but it's real.
27968	2	a	Heartfelt felicitations to [Steven] Soderbergh on his rebirth of the cool.
27969	9	a	It's a safe, dull, tired comedy that you'll think you've already seen even as you're watching it for the first time. 
27970	3	a	Beautifully photographed and directed with an intimate maturity, the film reveals its characters in an unhurried way, thus making the audience accomplices in the unfolding liaison.
27971	1	a	Jarmusch the sly formalist, it seems, has become a virtuoso of the interpersonal duet.
27972	5	a	Though this seemingly semi-biographical film highlights the French joie de vivre, sadly it also showcases a very conventional, Anglo-Saxon way of character development.
27973	6	a	Your enjoyment of all this will probably depend heavily on your willingness to let the words romp and Taliban coexist for approximately two hours.
27974	3	a	If Euripides had ever known Catholic guilt, he might have written something quite similar to Mystic River.
27975	5	a	So much of the picture misfires and/or simply doesn't work or make sense that the total package is not as good, enjoyable or entertaining as it should be.
27976	0	a	Eastwood shows off filmmaking so fluid and skilled that it makes you weep with joy.
27977	3	a	...a must for Kubrick aficionados...
27978	4	a	The laughs are low-key and although the characters are credible they seem to be missing a few dimensions, but the actors make this movie about an immature guy who moves into his newlywed pal's house a pleasant enough visit.
27979	1	a	The story darts in unexpected, dark directions, but is told by such talented people, we follow it willingly...
27980	8	a	A film about awareness, standing still and being cognizant of the things around you.
27981	3	a	It energetically captures the frenzied pace of contemporary existence, the complexities of life in a multicultural world, the rootless joys of living in a foreign city and the heady world of possibilities one envisions while in college.
27982	9	a	Pi turns what should be a metaphoric relationship into a stupefyingly literal-minded thriller.
27983	4	a	Writer/director Kasi Lemmons ... wants to use Hughes to reflect on the modern day black experience, and do without the need to make it palatable for white audiences. 
27984	3	a	A couple of sterling lead performances by Billy Crudup and Donald Sutherland.
27985	4	a	Not that the movie doesn't have its charms even for non-soccer-fans-though they may want to duck out for popcorn during the big game. Those who love the game can nudge the rating up a notch or two.
27986	9	a	There's no escaping that Dominion is finally an act of commercial scavenging.
27987	6	a	Formulaic melodrama - appealing primarily to pre-teens or those who have never seen John Hughes' angst-riddled comedic dramas.
27988	5	a	The ride looks tricked out, but it sure is clunky under the hood.
27989	1	a	Think of it as an inverted Truman Show, with David Duchovny and Demi Moore as yuppified secret salesmen hawking an idealized suburban lifestyle while incognito.
27990	9	a	Bloody mess of a guy film loses its battle to have any real meaning.
27991	2	a	"Essentially this movie is about giving an old man his dignity, which is found through letting him play out an embarrassing misunderstanding, letting someone figure that out for themselves is more respectful than ""saving"" them from it by stepping in. "
27992	1	a	Everyone except poultry farmers and airline companies should rejoice at the creation of this wonderful Claymation movie.
27993	0	a	This movie is a one-of-a-kind political satire.
27994	3	a	Jane Campion's film is as lyrical as you might expect but it's also enlivened with a bracing air of irreverence.
27995	3	a	This is a film as confident and assured in its moral fortitude, and as soaringly powerful in its oratory, as the great man himself.
27996	4	a	Julianne Moore isn't merely good in the lead role. She's devastatingly, heartbreakingly good, and she's a big reason why Still Alice is as moving as it is.
27997	5	a	Another bland, passionless costume drama as stuffy and oxygen-depriving as its corsets.
27998	2	a	This film is an accurate, if not wholly engaging, depiction of young life at a cross-roads. Whether anyone made it across is not the point...it's that there was an effort made to at all.
27999	9	a	Maybe the less said about Don't Say a Word the better.
28000	7	a	Good performances and striking looks are meaningless if your story falls apart when the tensions should be ratcheting up to unbearable level
28001	9	a	The Darkest Minds is such a formulaic hodgepodge of secondhand plot points that it can't help but feel like an insult to its target demographic: just another case of adults trying to manipulate kids, this time by bilking them out of their allowance.
28002	2	a	The pleasure of Hitchcock comes in large part from the sparring between Mirren and Hopkins. As you'd expect, they're a class act, delivering the old married couple routine with conviction and plenty of humour.
28003	3	a	Starts slowly, spending too long on the set-up, but once it kicks into gear, the film is a frothy treat.
28004	3	a	I can't remember when I've heard an audience respond with cheers and applause as joyous as they did here when the big kiss moment finally arrived.
28005	5	a	Fanboys is pretty much for fanboys.
28006	6	a	"Skip this film, and re-watch ""All the President's Men"" instead."
28007	4	a	Frustrating but fascinating drama has drugs, sex, language.
28008	5	a	Perhaps one day someone will make a truly even-keeled movie about the life of Pete Rose ... but this flick doesn't even come close.
28009	4	a	The plot's implausibilities -- and the energetic set pieces that Li and his kung-fu-fighting co-stars mount -- are mighty entertaining in and of themselves.
28010	5	a	I'll remember [Jenifer Lewis'] ferocity long after I've forgotten everything else about this movie.
28011	3	a	Broken Embraces is a film in which the director demonstrates a continuing, virtuoso fluency in a cinematic language that he himself invented. It's an embrace I want to submit to.
28012	4	a	Until an inexplicably awful revelation at the end, The Prestige is a taut, exciting portrait of obsession and the dark competitive spirit of professional magicians.
28013	4	a	Hopkins and Baldwin turn in smoldering performances, but this is definitely not top-shelf Mamet...
28014	0	a	Jurassic Park is a how-to guide for structuring a multi-character disaster film.
28015	6	a	The viewer's confidence and attention are not only undermined, but completely disregarded. You get the same feeling as Charlie Brown when Lucy pulls the football away.
28016	5	a	Lame political comedy misses the mark.
28017	2	a	"constructs such a complete image of proud and passionate radio host Ralph Waldo ""Petey"" Greene that we immediately understand why the deep flaws in his personality could only have led to his downfall."
28018	1	a	A tremendously profound and unsettling film about the indignities of war.
28019	0	a	Remarkable fictional account of Mozart's life. One of the best films of its decade.
28020	1	a	This year's ARGO in that it's a smart, adult caper that has the potential to both score major awards and major box office. It's a blast from start to finish. 
28021	8	a	Don't even bother renting the eventual video.
28022	6	a	Never fully rises to the occasion, maintaining a goofily even keel throughout but rarely tipping over into all-out froth and nuttiness.
28023	9	a	Crossover is not just awful, it's gloriously, stupendously, magnificently awful. And best of all, it has Wayne Brady as the bad guy.
28024	8	a	What a pain in the old caboose.
28025	6	a	To hose down the white elephant in the room right off the bat, yes, Paper Towns falls into place as a coming-of-age spin on the Manic Pixie Dream Girl archetype.
28026	0	a	Captures the sleazy allure of Manhattan like no other film.
28027	0	a	One of Woody Allen's very best ... which puts it in some pretty good company.
28028	1	a	...a dreamy movie that's all about the textures, the flat valley light glancing off the David Hockney planes. It's a movie that revels in its moviedom even as it replicates, in a very naturalistic way, a particular time and place.
28029	3	a	Set a standard for CG-beasties that remained unmatche for many years, and still stands as one of the best of its kind
28030	6	a	Its twists feel routine, its narrative spine limp and its conclusion especially rushed.
28031	6	a	Shane Black has never seemed like someone who needed cheap tricks to earn an honest smile.
28032	8	a	Many too many close-ups of feet slamming down on pedals, hands shifting gears, and eyes narrowing meaningfully in the rear-view mirror. I am the one who is furious at having to sit through this dumb movie.
28033	9	a	All-talk, no-action superhero flick is a dull, drab mess of shallow plots, dull characters and bland effects.
28034	3	a	The Imitation Game is impressive, particularly due to Cumberbatch and Knightley and the highs and lows of Turing's truly remarkable life.
28035	1	a	A bit of a downer, but profoundly so.
28036	0	a	Woody Allen does Fellini -- and the result is one of his best films.
28037	6	a	I really hate to admit this, but the film made me laugh on several occasions.
28038	6	a	Superficial, contrived and talky.
28039	3	a	An impressive, ultra-violent -- and deeply troubling -- take on Jesus' final hours.
28040	5	a	"The start of each story promises so much. Yet the more often we ask ""yes, and then?"", the less often Morgan and Eastwood stump up a convincing answer."
28041	1	a	An exceptionally funny science-fiction comedy.
28042	8	a	...a cinematic disaster so inadvertently sidesplitting it's worth the price of admission for the ridicule factor alone.
28043	9	a	...there's an opening scene...that's little more than kiddie porn, leaving an ugly tast thereafter.
28044	4	a	Hathaway and McAvoy bring some genuine, if discreet, sparks to their secret romance, but there's something fundamentally lifeless about director Julian Jarrold's shallow gloss on Pride and Prejudice.
28045	6	a	The screenplay by Kaufman, Crichton and Michael Backes is not about much of anything important.
28046	2	a	A pleasant if undemanding piece of work that is diverting to sit through though it won't stand up to any kind of rigorous examination.
28047	3	a	Breakin' has tons of quippy dialogue, not all of it sterling. But it comes at us so quickly, and from such likable actors in such pretty rooms, in such spiffy shirts ... we can't help but like it.
28048	9	a	This is an ugly film. And the only thing uglier is thinking about who on earth the filmmakers thought they were making it for.
28049	2	a	Show me a director better suited for a movie about magic than Christopher Nolan and I'll show you... a magician?
28050	0	a	"There is a charm and vitality to Raiders of the Ark, which Spielberg later admitted was ""the first movie where I actually shot the movie without thinking""."
28051	4	a	The images of someone essentially handicapped undergoing extensive physical training most definitely make for images that are both haunting and inspirational
28052	2	a	Is it any good? Well, yes -- often it is, but it's sometimes tough to find those moments.
28053	4	a	Valkyrie's brawny and big and bold, but it's also stronger, slicker and smarter than you'd think.
28054	3	a	An ingenious, diabolical, probably libelous, funhouse of a movie.
28055	9	a	The only things haunting this movie are cliches.
28056	5	a	Even though it has a few chilling and comical moments, overall it drags and doesn't have much of a bite.
28057	2	a	Scorsese-like, but not quite there. Bryan Cranston, John Leguizamo, Amy Ryan and the rest of the cast are terrific. The direction flags too frequently.
28058	4	a	The unlikely superhero of this film is the hamster, who brings the funny amid a flurry of weaker gags. But Bolt still has charm - it just won't hit with the adults the way the best animated films can.
28059	5	a	A by-the-numbers sci-fi thriller for the YA set that treads water in overly recognizable elements without offering much in the way of anything new or entertaining.
28060	9	a	Ditches the bizarre cult-of-personality trappings of the original, leaving only the blandest of ensemble relationship comedies.
28061	5	a	tries so hard to be likeable, you feel bad beating up on it
28062	3	a	Bondarchuk subverts the idea of Kafka - rather than this proving to be hell, there's an increasing sense that a loss of structure could be less a tearing down of Lukas' life than an opportunity to build something different.
28063	5	a	A summertime fun monster blockbuster B- film for the kid inside us that never grew up.
28064	6	a	As far as one-joke movies go, this one has its guffaws.
28065	3	a	If McDonagh's dark comedy-drama doesn't quite out-Fargo Fargo, it brilliantly illustrates the chaos a few choice words can cause in the hands of a talented filmmaker.
28066	3	a	"As in ""About Schmidt"" and ""Sideways,"" Payne - an Oscar winner for the script of ""The Descendants"" - finds poetry in everyday, lower-middle-class folks."
28067	6	a	It's really Dupree, Dupree and Way Too Much Dupree. Owen Wilson doesn't just star in the movie, he sucks the oxygen out of the room.
28068	5	a	Boring and predictable in both its narrative and its aesthetics, Paul Blart: Mall Cop is dumbed-down, low-rent slapstick with stereotypes galore and a violent undercurrent that doesn't sit well.
28069	6	a	You know that you're in trouble when audiences leave the theater talking about the supporting cast with nary a mention of the movie stars
28070	4	a	Amistad is an excellent story, poorly told.
28071	4	a	Even repeated readings of Pynchon's books don't guarantee a complete enlightenment. That means it's the chase that is more fascinating than the discovery, an approach that Andesron used in writing his screenplay and making the movie.
28072	4	a	Throws heady ideas at you faster than Michael Bay can explode a building, but the rate at which ideas stick is inconsistent. It does, however, develop a rhythm. The metered language forces you to adjust just as emotion develops.
28073	4	a	The plot and action are so preposterous that it's jarring when the movie tries to introduce serious business.
28074	3	a	The details are fresh and writer Rob Perez's dialogue about sex has more complexity and nuance than we expect.
28075	4	a	The perfect way to spend a pleasant hour or so introducing a child to the experience of going out to the movies.
28076	1	a	"You don't need a telescope to spot a new star. Check out the blisteringly funny relationship film ""Knocked Up"" and you'll leave the theaters certain that Seth Rogen is movie comedy's next big thing."
28077	3	a	splendid
28078	6	a	Feig's neorealist approach to the look of the film might work better if he didn't fill it with so many coincidences and melodramatic flourishes.
28079	5	a	Very young children may enjoy this sweet-natured, old-fashioned, simplistic tale, but the movie suffers from the same problems evident in Zemeckis' previous animated productions
28080	3	a	The results don't quite achieve inspiration, but it's still powerful stuff.
28081	6	a	The Predator is a goofy, gory, muddy mess that makes less and less visual and narrative sense as it races to its nonsense conclusion. That Sterling K. Brown and Olivia Munn though.
28082	0	a	A beast of a movie is gifted a superfluous-but-superb rouging of the cheeks, offering fanatics something new to study while newcomers will be ruined for any future television airings. 
28083	6	a	The colorless Peter and Annie and the preposterous Wick indulge in such wince-inducing, old-movie dialogue and ''tis a far, far better thing'-style emoting that the whole thing should be in black-and-white.
28084	3	a	It's a movie worth seeing.
28085	6	a	A few scenes are giggly funny. Some are just stupid.
28086	3	a	Sayles gives us sample tastes of characters and a situation that could have made a full-course cinematic meal.
28087	3	a	Sappy fun
28088	5	a	A theme park ride masquerading as master's thesis.
28089	3	a	The Curious Case of Benjamin Button puts a Hollywood sheen on a decidedly eccentric yarn.
28090	5	a	Good looks are about the only thing going for it.
28091	9	a	Coarse, misogynistic and blasphemous.
28092	6	a	The plot is pretty simple. The real question is can it entertain the kids, and the answer depends on how receptive your children are to gyrating dance sequences set to covers of old pop standards.
28093	4	a	Threatens to soar and to be important, but it only offers flashes of lucidity. That said, there's a consistent air of charged, end-of-days menace running through the film, which Cronenberg handles with an unbroken sense of precision and confidence.
28094	3	a	Long after you leave Justine, you'll be wondering what will happen to her and wishing her the best -- whatever that might mean.
28095	5	a	One hopes Rusty Nail just slaughters our trio of bathetic anti-heroes.
28096	2	a	The bracing nature of the humor, the energy of the direction and the authenticity of the performances go far to mitigate its weaknesses.
28097	9	a	An unmitigated disaster of a film...
28098	4	a	There's plenty to admire here, and any sort of gentleness at the multiplex is something to be treasured, but it's hard to ignore the film's general unwillingness to confront cruelty. 
28099	0	a	[It] just might be the Coen brothers' singular mythic masterwork.
28100	3	a	It may not be perfect, but The Ring makes a skin-crawling candidate for one of the scariest movies to hit the screen this year.
28101	0	a	Watching Raiders of the Lost Ark again on the big screen I was again reminded how summer films were once thoroughly entertaining and fulfilling.
28102	5	a	Just exactly like every other Ernest movie you've ever seen. And yet, Varney's innocent playfulness is somehow oddly appealing.
28103	2	a	'While the film's tough to watch, it's also impossible to look away from.'
28104	3	a	It's safe to say that, as a director, Clint Eastwood shows no fear.
28105	4	a	Scene by scene, the movie is compelling, but the scenes don't fit together especially well.
28106	0	a	The story is utterly devastating, but it is lifted and made accessible by the combination of cinematic ingenuity and astonishingly real performances.
28107	3	a	Seinfeld's pleasingly idiosyncratic comic voice comes through in the haphazard, slaphappy storyline. [Blu-Ray]
28108	4	a	The comedy is broad, cartoonish, and quite funny in a faux Little Rascals manner. The movie is almost completely derivative, but that's part of the fun.
28109	3	a	Russell and co-writer Eric Singer have used the general details of the events to whip up a truly hilarious look at a bunch of dreamers and con artists all lying each other into a lather, and it's a raucous entertainment.
28110	2	a	As a send-up of terrorism, Team America has more mild sizzle than bang. Its real target is the axis of ego, which knows no borders.
28111	4	a	Pretty to look at, tough to follow, and, ultimately, difficult to swallow, Stay certainly isn't a bad film ... but it sure as heck isn't one you'll be raving about anytime soon.
28112	2	a	It's a comfortable sort of confusion that Russell has brought to the table. Good luck figuring out exactly what the point is.
28113	6	a	Paris Can Wait is Wealthy Empty Nester Porn ... The only missing ingredients are truly likable lead characters and something approaching an involving storyline.
28114	5	a	The attractive youngsters run, scream, declare that this can't be happening and repeat as necessary.
28115	3	a	This near-future Western from Buffy creator Joss Whedon is a big, bold, B-movie piece of entertainment.
28116	4	a	She is cute and she is good and in the end she loves her Guinness-breathed daddy and that's all that really matters anyway, isn't it?
28117	1	a	What is difficult is to view this film without a mind seeking to be intrigued, because, if you don't want intrigue, you shouldn't be watching Pi.
28118	4	a	'A new action hero is Bourne.' As incredibly cheesy and precious that advertising tag line for The Bourne Identity is, there's no discounting the truth it does hold.
28119	5	a	Wallows in gender stereotypes, solidifying the impression that Schneider can't compete with the likes of Sandler and fellow SNL alumnus Mike Myers.
28120	0	a	Mel Gibson, the Lord love him--and I believe He does, has succeeded in producing the first major motion picture ever that is both spiritually and historically challenging.
28121	0	a	A hugely impressive slice of prairie naturalism.
28122	6	a	Permanent Midnight offers nothing we haven't seen before.
28123	8	a	Every bit as predictable, shopworn and unappetizing as its premise suggests.
28124	1	a	Apatow's awfully sharp as a chronicler of contemporary romantic anxieties.
28125	3	a	Comedy-drama has more to it than it may at first seem.
28126	5	a	In a word, Letters to Juliet is rubbish, but Seyfried and Redgrave make it tolerable in their different ways.
28127	0	a	The greatest film of all time now has a DVD to match.
28128	2	a	A new Bond film, we are assured in the closing credits, is on its way -- Skyfall provides reasons to look forward to more.
28129	9	a	David Gelb's new film is so dependent on the classic standbys of the genre, and so slight in every other regard, that it immediately draws attention to just how creaky they've gotten over the years
28130	6	a	Somebody needs to write them up a ticket - for impersonating a great movie.
28131	4	a	Whenever Cameron leaves the technical tricks, awkward recreations and computer graphics behind and focuses solely on the magnificent remains of the Titanic, the movie is awe-inspiring.
28132	5	a	It's an entertaining romp that can kill some time, and keep the kids excited with colorful panache.
28133	2	a	"I get choked up just writing about this movie. Yes, ""Albert Nobbs"" is a bit of a labor, but the central theme has such gnawing weight that for me it overcomes the movie's lumpiness."
28134	3	a	An engaging, absorbing, strangely illuminating experience.
28135	5	a	A flavorless package of aimless gambits and empty characters.
28136	3	a	Maybe Early Man isn't Aardman's best work, but it's so wholeheartedly kind and clever that it's impossible not to embrace the ride.
28137	5	a	I guess it wouldn't have been enough to just make an intelligent and gripping drama about Ivy League secret societies. No, we had to have a murder, coverup, good guys, bad guys, and so on.
28138	7	a	A predictable story.
28139	5	a	Wolff has something, Delevingne has something, and no doubt the book had something, too - its devotees should find enough here to warm to, while the rest of us look on slightly bemused.
28140	4	a	Most of the credit goes to Smith, who is wonderfully at-ease in everything he does and here he effortlessly carries the movie.
28141	4	a	Amy Adams is the reason to see Enchanted, the only reason, but she is so good and committed to a role most actress would play with a knowing smirk, that reason is more than enough.
28142	0	a	If you succumb to Koreeda's slow rhythms, the climbs up a hill to find a magnificent view, the walks along the beach, the simple peace of a shared meal, this is the kind of movie that will leave you feeling restored, maybe a little misty-eyed as well.
28143	2	a	A fun and welcomed trip down memory lane. Catching up with these guys wasn't so bad after all. Better than expected. [Full review in Spanish]
28144	3	a	The film nicely balances the stories, allowing some of the teammates to emerge as believably streetwise characters.
28145	6	a	It's tough for actors to be nuanced when the movie isn't, and these intriguingly jagged edges soon get smoothed out.
28146	5	a	Rarely have good intentions been wrapped in such a sticky package.
28147	6	a	Cumberbatch does a wonderful job bringing this characterization to life and it's often his performance that overcomes some of the film's melodramatic tendencies.
28148	5	a	At about the halfway mark of this movie, the bottom drops out and all that we're left with are a lot of questions and very few plausible answers
28149	2	a	Its affectionate, lighthearted laughs add a little sparkle to the holiday schedule.
28150	3	a	A deeply affecting movie.
28151	6	a	Despite the storytelling faults, Ravetch and Robertson offer remarkable footage from the evaporating Arctic.
28152	4	a	A bittersweet romantic comedy, plain and simple, and, by the time it has added in subplots involving dance competitions and football superstitions, also rather unwieldy.
28153	0	a	It re-animates the thrill, not just the nostalgia, of old-school comic books and pulp adventure.
28154	6	a	Air Force One hasn't a moment of genuine tension because every development is entirely expected.
28155	4	a	...every once in awhile, this summer popcorn sci-fi movie provides a glimmer of Asimov...
28156	6	a	With The Other Boleyn Girl, the sheen and shine of the clothing and sets can't quite blind us to the fact there's very little drama under all the drapery, and you'll recall the textures of the fabrics long after you've forgotten the threads of the plot.
28157	3	a	From the very opening, when Hitch begins explaining to the camera that love sometimes needs an outside assist to get started, he owns the audience.
28158	0	a	Indie icon John Sayles gives us yet another minor masterpiece that looks at love and want among the haves and have-nots.
28159	6	a	The movie is a spirited exercise in caricature rather than a cohesive comedy. Everybody's playing somebody real, but the movie never approaches reality.
28160	7	a	From such intriguing beginnings it manages to degenerate to the point where I expected Nedermeyer to show up at any moment and start spanking Kevin Bacon.
28161	1	a	No one will go away disappointed or indifferent. It's a movie that sticks with you like Elmer's glue.
28162	1	a	So Skyfall may not be the film you are expecting from the franchise but it's a film that will prove more satisfying with each viewing.
28163	5	a	Rehashes the horror genre in an unoriginal and uninvolving way that simply marks its time and body count until the muddled and silly ending.
28164	4	a	"Given the amazing artwork, if a better character [than a cyborg John Silver] had been inserted, we'd be talking about ""Treasure Planet"" as another Disney classic."
28165	2	a	David O. Russell has a twisted mind; I like that in a man.
28166	3	a	A good-natured study in ... film-nerd humor.
28167	4	a	Without the pizzazz of computer animation you can see how it will struggle to find its target audience.
28168	3	a	I can't bring myself to condemn this film... [Gibson] made the film he was inspired to make, which included writing, directing, producing, financing and marketing [it] himself
28169	3	a	Offers up a subversive comic sensibility, one that somehow combines Buster Keaton's deadpan stare with Frank Capra's tireless optimism and filters them both through a black-ice Finnish point of view.
28170	5	a	A stagy, arty, and uncompelling account of the Welsh writer and his menage-y relations with his boozy Irish wife and his young Welsh girlfriend.
28171	1	a	While the audience has its laughs along the way, the violent tension of war often threatens to erupt, and slowly, subtly gathering force is the film's emotional weight.
28172	3	a	Lurid, twisted, and violent. Not for kids.
28173	3	a	Affleck manages to strike so many right notes, that by the end of the film, it is easy to forget what a loathsome toady he was at film's start, and you cannot help but feel real pain as Ford's inevitably sad fate unravels before our eyes. 
28174	0	a	John Curran's film, scripted by Taylor Allen and Andrew Logan, is detailed, precise and gut-wrenching.
28175	6	a	"I, Frankenstein"" isn't the monstrosity we'd feared. But it's still not good."
28176	4	a	"As I said, SOAP makes no apologies and that is the beauty of it. It's rare that a movie is presented as ""It is what it is"". "
28177	3	a	Charming story about an adult rediscovering his inner child. 
28178	2	a	Another perceptive take on modern relationships by triple threat Westfeldt. 
28179	3	a	Simple, but engaging.
28180	8	a	A hornet's nest of irrational behavior, wrapped up snugly in a smug, shallow, and diseased feature film that does a masterful job brainlessly wiggling around for an interminable amount of screentime. 
28181	3	a	Matchstick Men is a lot more engaging than a circular argument, but it's about as frustrating.
28182	4	a	For a movie, it's pretty good at that balancing act Kate works so hard to achieve.
28183	4	a	Better direction would have benefited a film that nevertheless offers modest thrills for genre devotees.
28184	3	a	Folks looking for just a sci-fi film will be wonderfully surprised by Whedon's whip crack dialogue and hardcore fans will be just happy to see these people back.
28185	3	a	Gorgeous Tuscan scenery and a breakthrough performance by Liv Tyler help make this sudsy flick entertaining.
28186	8	a	If we were to reduce all of world cinema to just a dozen images, Karina's perfect, pensive face would have to be among them.
28187	6	a	The two have palpable chemsitry, but the film's hyper pace keeps pushing them forward when it might have nicer to just let these two make us laugh
28188	1	a	The film's greatest strength comes from its sad wisdom about relationships and the way its protagonists recognize how precarious their connection is.
28189	3	a	"Friends with Kids"" goes on a beat or two too long, and lands in the obvious place, but it's filled with smarts and laughs and passion."
28190	3	a	everything a romantic comedy is supposed to be
28191	5	a	Black Snake Moan strikes me as hogwash. It fundamentally does not work; its consciously far-fetched, out-there notions of the things damaged people do in the name of love are reductive and go only so far.
28192	1	a	It's a movie that, by its serene final scene, changes its viewer. You leave happier, honored to have been, for two hours, part of this family.
28193	9	a	...what we have here is a good old-fashioned exploitation flick disguised as high art.
28194	5	a	Kasi Lemmons' Black Nativity is a lot like a glazed holiday ham: sticky, sweet, and all too easy to mess up.
28195	7	a	Eat Pray Love is overlong and quickly becomes tedious. It features narcissistic, inward looking characters of no interest at all and amounts to a very poorly made film.
28196	7	a	My takeaway from this thesis on anger is that it's okay to be a c-nt but not a dick. 
28197	4	a	Napoleon Dynamite may not even be friggin' sweet, but it does have skills. [Blu-ray]
28198	4	a	Nope, there's not much here. But it's still good, cheesy fun.
28199	5	a	Dangerfield misfire comedy on several levels; little to smile about.
28200	4	a	There's a sense that Romero has run out of ideas and is recycling.
28201	6	a	Nothing special -- it just devotedly does its job to give the audience a string of suspense scenarios.
28202	4	a	Saint Laurent' is a fascinating tour of the man's life and times, but too often we feel like it's a portrait that's not even skin-deep, but fabric-deep.
28203	2	a	Helen Mirren can make any movie more than tolerable including this soap.
28204	0	a	The direction by Luca Guadagnino is reminiscent of Bertolucci's sensitivity at its best, the fabulous cinematography by Sayombhu Mukdeeprom rapturously captures the rich work of art that is Italy in summer, and the actors are to die for.
28205	3	a	Martin Ritt's movie set a new trend in American Westerns in its criticism of the White men and in suggesting that the Native Americans are morally superior.
28206	0	a	Brilliant use of the screwball comedy form to represent and explore existential themes...fodder for dorm debates and cultural studies theses, it is also a ton of fun. 
28207	2	a	By not belittling the melancholies of adolescence, and staying away from the twee trappings of the genre, Kelly Fremon Craig's debut rings true with authenticity.
28208	4	a	Quite a delightful surprise, a characteristically deliberate but singularly amusing shaggy-dog tale.
28209	10	a	Transylmania is such a colossal comedic misfire that it makes the execrable Scary Movie films look like masterworks of Preston Sturges-esque genius by comparison.
28210	1	a	Thoroughly entertaining, utterly conventional. 
28211	1	a	Fast Five boasts incredible action scenes that are all varied and equally exciting. The film is full of clean, well choreographed shots that are easy to watch and the cast works great as a whole unit, making the film's running time breeze by.
28212	0	a	It may not be the best film of the year, but it's certainly made of the right stuff.
28213	7	a	Not funny. Not interesting.
28214	3	a	Although this is often mistaken for being directed by Tim Burton, his unique and creative imagination is clearly the film's fuel, followed ,of course, by the impressive claymation.
28215	6	a	As lifeless as a flat wine.
28216	6	a	There's no one to blame but Stallone for action sequences that degenerate into incoherence, to the point where it's impossible to know who's truck is exploding and who's shooting at whom.
28217	3	a	A very good, award-worthy film.
28218	3	a	First-rate popcorn movie: undemanding, entertaining and thoroughly enjoyable.
28219	3	a	Sensationally entertaining, darkly comedic, witty and refreshingly bizarre. A guilty pleasure. Nicolas Cage is in top form.
28220	2	a	a danceable delight
28221	5	a	Jack Goes Boating wasn't a particularly witty or insightfully written play to begin with, and much of its elemental charm has dissipated upon being put to film. 
28222	3	a	It's a neat satire of the World Wide Web that manages to communicate its message, look amazing, and have a lot of fun without getting lost in the constant babble and frontal cortex frying saturation of the online world. 
28223	4	a	The movie does a good job convincing us of Brown's genius, but it does little to put anything at stake. 
28224	3	a	Deepening and widening an imaginative world full of cleverly detailed creatures, much as J.K. Rowling has done in her books, Chamber is a speedy, funny winner.
28225	6	a	Doesn't have an original bullet in its chamber.
28226	2	a	Unmistakably bears the conflicting influence of Pixar and Disney's old ideals.
28227	2	a	It's a simple exercise in terror that avoids too much explicit violence, and a quietly impressive little movie.
28228	6	a	As it stands, it's a mildly diverting dramedy of missed opportunities.
28229	5	a	While I stayed mostly stony-faced through both the original Ted and this sequel, professional duty obliges me to recognise MacFarlane as a genuine eccentric with a certain amount of flair.
28230	5	a	Despite an intriguing opening and an overqualified cast, The Lazarus Effect can't shake a been-there/resurrected-that vibe.
28231	9	a	The hero is named for a disgusting bodily function that's hardly PG material, but the movie itself seems to be aimed at grade schoolers.
28232	1	a	A very special movie that welcomes you in and lets you sit for a while, charms you, and then melts your heart.
28233	2	a	These imagined adventures are implausible, but they give the director an opportunity to paint an amusing slice of London life during a historic moment overflowing with both joy and sorrow.
28234	0	a	A hugely entertaining pulp thriller that delivers the goods in a stylish an effective manner that beats most other recent films of its ilk like a gong
28235	3	a	A very worthwhile entry in the proud tradition of Czech filmmakers examining serious social issues with dark humor.
28236	6	a	The Last Witch Hunter delivers a lackluster fantasy plot and bland, one-note characters.
28237	3	a	As literary desecrations go, this makes for perfectly acceptable, occasionally very enjoyable children's entertainment. You'll forget about it by Monday, though, and if they're old enough to have developed some taste, so will your kids.
28238	3	a	Showalter navigating things in such a way that he's able to pay off early jokes in a way that feels cathartic and genuine, yet is still humorous, while also allowing for an aura of jovial possibility that's positively joyous.
28239	0	a	It's hands-down the film to beat this year for quality and classic status.
28240	7	a	Will genre fans take this totally artificial, over-the-top serial-killer movie as a straight thriller, or understand it as the parody one hopes it's intended to be?
28241	4	a	Seyfried has worked opposite some of the greatest actors in filmdom in recent years, including Meryl Streep and Julianne Moore. That she again holds her own, this time with Redgrave, is a measure of her talent.
28242	1	a	With Lost in Translation, director Sofia Coppola makes a serious bid to claim her last name for herself.
28243	4	a	Characters don't talk to each other -- they talk to the camera
28244	2	a	The film never really bloats or sags, and remains utterly pleasurable throughout its entire running time. 
28245	0	a	Clint Eastwood's latest directorial effort is perhaps the best film he's ever made.
28246	10	a	Floridly awful...offers absolutely no surprises.
28247	3	a	Expertly crafted - astonishingly so, at times - and precisely, punishingly performed, It Comes at Night is a highly effective exercise in the controlled release of raw, relentless dread.
28248	5	a	If only there was some nobility among these royals.
28249	7	a	The problems here can be summed up thus: 'Produced by Tom Cruise.'
28250	3	a	It's great fun, but certainly not great art.
28251	2	a	The bottom line with this movie is really whether or not you think it's all 'dumb and nothing else' or 'dumb and pretty funny'.
28252	4	a	When a party at an elegant villa threatens to become a full-blown musical number, one wonders if Mel Brooks has taken charge of the production.
28253	9	a	When not simply functioning as a sorry excuse for a thriller, The Tourist also operates as the Angelina Jolie Ego Trip Show. 
28254	1	a	Everything about Bjork and Dancer in the Dark is enigmatic in an uncomfortable dissecting way that shows beauty in the crudest way, and crudeness in the complexity of advanced social mores.
28255	3	a	Touching story with great music.
28256	4	a	The true story is inspiring but the film gets much too preachy
28257	3	a	Hancock is an irreverent hero for our times--perhaps reflecting our own national zeitgeist, with America's previously untainted superpower image suddenly a matter of debate rather than fact.
28258	3	a	The nuanced friendship between Ralph and Vanellope remains the most engaging part of the film, once you've overcome the slight weirdness of a hulking man being best mates with a small girl. 
28259	8	a	Like plastic, extruded action figures involved in a sadistic child's bathtub-masturbation fantasies.
28260	5	a	The first half is pure pleasure as Murray gets thoroughly immersed and enmeshed in Kabul crazy.
28261	8	a	There's an audience out there for this kind of thing, but if this is what passes for funny, what in the world of comedy doesn't qualify?
28262	3	a	With Hanks sharing screenwriting duty with Vardalos, you can almost make a game out of which characters and plot elements were of her invention and which ones he eventually smoothed out into a comedy that once it gets going is hard to stop smiling at.
28263	3	a	Although writer/producer/director Leo McCarey bagged three Oscars for this effortless piece of Catholic whimsy, its enduring charm rests with the Oscar-winning performances of Bing Crosby and Barry Fitzgerald.
28264	4	a	With painstaking stop-motion photography, director Selick and his team have created a fluid universe that is not so much a cartoon world as a pretend world.
28265	3	a	There are a couple of frightening sequences with a rattlesnake and a hawk that may scare small children, but all ends well. Rango will rope you in.
28266	3	a	Smart, sassy and sweet but...never vulgar or mean, it's a knowing but not condescending modern family-friendly fairy tale.
28267	3	a	The film is a series of gorgeously conceived set pieces and terrific character interaction and, unlike newer films, it's not afraid to get a bit grim.
28268	5	a	The new Phoenix lacks the tension, the grim, sado-masochistic Darwinism of the original or the agonizing nuts-and-bolts of the ordeal.
28269	2	a	With Depp in the lead, Secret Window never quite slips into mediocrity, but it's not destined to be remembered among King's finest efforts, either.
28270	3	a	Cheadle and Ejiofor are riveting together; they have the kind of apparently effortless chemistry that makes every scene they share a delight.
28271	0	a	One of the finest biopics in recent memory, this drama manages to present someone as iconic as Martin Luther King Jr. as a normal man anyone can aspire to emulate.
28272	4	a	Although it's certainly watchable and has some striking moments, Flightplan is ultimately a middling effort that lacks dramatic pay-off.
28273	3	a	Meditative and downbeat rather than crowd-pleasing, the film includes a few sequences that suggest the direction Lucas career later took.
28274	1	a	Another fascinating and unpredictable character-driven movie from the Coen brothers.
28275	3	a	Martin McDonagh's latest and best film to date journeys through familiar territory with no shortcuts or quick exits. [Full review in Spanish]
28276	4	a	There's something joyfully old-fashioned about its wide-eyed, nostalgic sense of wonderment.
28277	1	a	Jackman and Bale are phenomenal, delivering three-dimensional beings so electric and alive I almost felt I could have reached through the screen and shook their hands had either been open or willing to let me touch it.
28278	6	a	A genially toothless political satire.
28279	6	a	...the movie's on-the-nose vision of the man makes for an unsurprising narrative.
28280	6	a	Not the funniest film ever on this subject, but a nice statement and satire on relationships today.
28281	9	a	Couples Retreat is essentially Vaughn and Favreau's baby, and it is absolutely, inexcusably terrible.
28282	5	a	The advertising materials... carry just the right kind of gleeful, confident attitude -- but sadly, Stallone's actual movie is a giant mess and a wasted opportunity.
28283	3	a	Marsh, who made the multi-awarded Man on a Wire, takes no sides but lets the humans speak for themselves, rum lot that they are.
28284	0	a	A relationship picture with elegant connective tissue; it's brittle and real, focused on the nuances of body language and unspoken desire, while indulging in a cheeky bit of knowing absurdity when the mood strikes.
28285	3	a	Occasionally the action is so pulsing that we forget the actors are only half-clothed.
28286	1	a	This admirable franchise should change your idea of what makes a good thriller.
28287	5	a	A lot of people are going to bend over backwards to give Anderson's latest a rave review. But all you have to do is watch it alongside Boogie Nights to see how far Inherent Vice falls short.
28288	5	a	The games and setting aren't gritty enough to let this urban sports drama crossover into something a general audience would care to see.
28289	5	a	Kikuchi seems to have wandered in from a completely different, campier film; but that's more than can be said for Reeves, who appears to have wandered in from the street.
28290	4	a	This cheerful farce often feels scaled down for Sunday-night TV.
28291	4	a	Without Oyelowo's texture and firepower, perhaps the picture would've been understood, but it wouldn't have been as precise in its emotion.
28292	5	a	A romantic comedy that is neither romantic nor particularly funny.
28293	6	a	Most of the shorts, despite the star power on tap, are negligible.
28294	3	a	While you're looking here, it's executing a trick there, and the film is, in fact, structured like a magic act with three parts called the Pledge, the Turn and the Prestige.
28295	1	a	A visually impressive, well acted adaptation of the book, with significant differences in tone from the Swedish film.
28296	0	a	Jandreau, acting opposite his real-life family members and friends, disappears into a role largely based on his own experiences, oozing empathy from his pores.
28297	0	a	...captures the profound and infinite through simple vignettes and unsurpassed composition that juxtapose modern industry, trains, and clocks with humanity
28298	8	a	Starts on a roll, but finally craps out.
28299	5	a	A Royal Night Out is a right royal mess, despite Buckingham Palace being staffed by some fine actors.
28300	4	a	A cartoonish Baby Doll, with a suggestive blues song title, about sex, guilt and redemption. Black Snake is also a rather flimsy parable unable to support the weight of Brewers ambition.
28301	9	a	Sure, it's supposed to just be a silly popcorn movie, but treating these cardboard cutouts as people to admire and care about is dishonest and contemptible. That the movie sucks besides is the final insult.
28302	4	a	A middling entertainment.
