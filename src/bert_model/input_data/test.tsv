110	Director Andy Tennant and screenwriter Kevin Bisch establish a breezy tone and offer up a New York that exists only in the movies, in the best, most escapist sense.

115	Although the film's frantic momentum occasionally lags, much to your chagrin, it's probably the result of some law of physics -- no movie could possibly be this funny every minute of its entire length.

126	Jarmusch has introduced historical references ... that have opened up his imagination and extended his thematic and affective range well beyond that of his first five features.

128	Darling Companion'' doesn't amount to much more than a fairly painless way for the AARP set to spend an hour and a half watching a movie with stars their own age.
129	The Incredibles is the coolest movie ever made. It rolls Marvel Comics, James Bond and Jonny Quest into the ultimate Saturday morning cartoon sugar buzz.
130	The diary allows for Toller's narration to feel natural and place us into the mind on the verge of destruction, and the closing moments express the sensation of good and evil; the closing shot alone is worth the price of admission
131	A surprisingly underrated little thriller which should have helped Nivola earn his Hollywood stripes.
132	Paul Thomas Anderson's hippie noir seems completely stoned: inarticulate, confused and prone to giggling at unknown jokes. Pynchon fans might tolerate it.

138	A freewheeling film that winds up celebrating the need to be true to yourself.
139	An unlikely choice as director and producer, it's thanks to Eastwood's relatively thin sentimental streak that the film doesn't fall headlong into a lagoon of schmaltz.
140	Confirms that espionage can be compelling without being sexy, even with Matt Damon in the starring role.
141	The film has charm and even some grace...An offhandedly luscious vision that the actors are careful not to muss.
142	An experience that will let you imagine yourself to be in the middle of a chaotic video game.
143	Tremendous cast. Gigantic special effects. Epic story. Same ticket price.
144	Congrats for pulling some new rabbits out of the hat with this formula.
145	Smart dialogue, a gifted ensemble and good intentions from Jennifer Westfeldt, but her grown-up romcom can't quite escape feeling like a sitcom on the big screen.
146	It lingers in the imagination long after more disciplined, well-behaved films have faded.
147	Somehow the film fails to inspire more than admiration, never reaching the same heights of empathy achieved by less impeccable treatments of the same topic.
148	It's surprising how quickly the worst elements of the film began to stack up, and do their part to tear the whole thing down. 
149	Perhaps had they been given a script, a purpose or a mission, Miami Vice the movie might have been something worthy of the talented Mann's attention.
150	Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri tells the story of a woman emulating God's vengeance when she might profit more by emulating his forgiveness, especially toward herself.
151	Only hints at the comedy and poignancy that its two powerhouse leads could deliver if given better material.
152	Danny Boyle's movie achieves -- at least for a while -- the psychedelic high for which it clearly aims, but like the heroin fixes he vividly portrays, his film doesn't have much long-term impact.
153	The film's confident tonal control is a compliment to Corbijn's skill, but it's also recognition of Philip Seymour Hoffman's wonderfully controlled central performance. You don't realize how stunning the whole experience really was until it's over.
154	The unexpected result of this often majestic film, as keenly written/directed by Chloe Zhao, is the likelihood of Jandreau actually becoming a movie star.
155	A lush, operatic period piece that abounds in detail, incident and spectacle and yet seldom connects on the emotional plane.
156	Might work as a short story but as a full-length makes for a long, slow round of watch-checking.
157	Well-acted, quietly moving and mildly intriguing, but not nearly as powerful as it could have been with a braver script that took more risks. 
158	A warm and moving sleeper hit.
159	The cumulative effect of the relentless horror on parade numbs the movie's power as a work of drama.
160	I, Robot is the summer's best action movie so far. It proves that you don't necessarily need to detach your brain in order to walk into a big budget summer blockbuster.
161	While Fassbender and Vikander are excellent and the chemistry between them is palpable, The Light Between Oceans never quite shrugs off its staid decorum to become something truly moving.
162	Starts out strong but falters in the middle.
163	It's all enough to make one ponder the question that always comes up when a new King of Lowbrow is crowned: Why haven't the French heard of this guy?
164	"For me, it was worthwhile just to hear R. Lee Ermey call one of his victims ""Dumplin.'"
165	This story of a courageous child's battle with cancer would have been so much better if it had been a documentary.
166	It's good enough to watch, but not good enough to re-watch.
167	Vital as they are, Gollum and Bilbo can only do so much to keep us enchanted. Is Jackson able to sustain the magic in two more installments? I peer into Tolkien's Misty Mountains and embrace the journey.

169	Few use the backdrop of gender inequality more awkwardly.
170	Poorly directed by Joseph Sargent, who relies heavily on blood and fast editing to create tension since there certainly isn't any written into the script.
171	The Good Girl belongs to Aniston, who buries Rachel in style with a sweet, soulful, hangdog performance that you will be thinking of long after you leave the cinema. .
172	As fantasy-adventures go, Peter Jackson's The Lord of the Rings trilogy makes this one look like a Hobbit belch.
173	A sweetly winning domestic comedy.
174	As far as major studio supernatural thrillers are concerned, this one is pretty darn good, a well-crafted, aesthetically artful suspenser.
175	A problematic blockbuster with one essential saving grace: It's profoundly frightening in a way that few directors have the talent to capture.
176	Friedkin plays a trick that might be mean if it wasn't so fascinating to see him pull off, blending laugh-out-loud humor with absolutely repulsive images, forcing disoriented and unsettled audiences to wind up laughing when they should be disturbed.
177	The problem is, Hill gets lost in the foaming desire by Gans to maintain the movement and depth of the game, leaving the action lifeless and dreadfully repetitive.
178	Meet Yoav Shamir -- the Israeli Michael Moore, who marches through the power centers of the U.S. and his homeland to challenge the religious orthodoxy.
179	Soderbergh is in the mood for some fun, and so is a star-filled cast led by Channing Tatum, Adam Driver and Daniel Craig.
180	Witless, pointless, tasteless and idiotic.
181	"Hopkins' performance makes ""Hitchcock"" as much fun as one of the old episodes from ""Alfred Hitchcock Presents."
182	Has the allure of a freshness it may not entirely deserve, but one that makes it go down very smoothly.
183	Written almost exclusively in taut dialogue, the book already reads like a screenplay, and the Coen brothers have taken full advantage.
184	If it wants to be a romance between [Cusack and Roberts], I've seen more sparks fly between ostriches.
185	A powerful movie that loses some of its momentum by touching on too many stories. It's not always easy to watch, but it's thought provoking.
186	As is so often the case in modest, aimless little movies like this one, it is the acting that saves Jack Goes Boating from triviality or worse.
187	"The World's End marks the third part of Pegg and Wright's self-described ""Cornetto trilogy."" It's an appropriate moniker. With this final film they've slowed down a bit, grown up a lot. And saved the richest bite until last."
188	It's got a cast that any Hollywood producer would envy, all doing good work as the various people touched by McCandless during his journey.
189	A charming, lighthearted little lark of a film.
190	The barroom brawls and open-air confrontations look uncommonly authentic, and yet, given the solid chemistry between Chan and Wilson, the audience can look forward to amusing exchanges during the relatively quiet intervals.
191	Worse, it loses its edge early on, Stone and Parker not going far enough for the attacks to be anything other than purely prurient.
192	The Green Hornet may well be Michel Gondry's most elaborate meta-joke on escapist infantilism.
193	The Serenity itself is a low-tech Millennium Falcon-type scow, losing parts on its way to another hard landing, and the film's effects are modest yet effective.
194	Fans will enjoy slightly less funny, still risque sequel.
195	Maryam is a small film, but it offers large rewards.
196	The film is frequently gorgeous, technologically adventurous and eventually thrilling.
197	Xtro is an ugly, mean-spirited and despairing thriller that left me thoroughly depressed. Why was this movie made? What vision filled the filmmakers with a desire to share this work with an audience?
198	A vital and timely missive to a new generation that is as sobering as it is uplifting, all built around a performance of astounding accomplishment.
199	It's destined to spend a short and painful life in theaters and then join the ranks of the DVD and late-night-cable undead.
200	For a film with so many potentially hallucinatory avenues, imagination seems to be a worthless currency.

209	Some of the computer animation is handsome, and various amusing sidekicks add much-needed levity to the otherwise bleak tale, but overall the film never rises above mediocrity.
210	Yes, it's a boxing comeback story. But the car accident makes it different, and Teller and Eckhart make it better than it ought to be.
211	What's left is a plodding revenge story, memorable only for the way it strips the last vestiges of interest from what was once a fascinating character.
212	Succumbs to turgidity. And...intentionally or not...conveys the impression that the film uncritically celebrates the Confederacy. [Blu-ray]
213	Charming love story plus great song and dance.
214	The performances of the entire ensemble cast are thoroughly entertaining.
215	A welcome slice of moodiness in a film season hell-bent on happiness at all costs.
216	Former CBS and CNN producer Amy Berg delves with piercing intelligence into one of most shocking scandals that has rocked the Catholic Church in recent years.
217	When 'I, Robot' digs in to deliver the goods, it does so with first-rate action and special effects sequences that are thrilling.
218	Been there, done that, liked it much better the first time around - when it was called The Professional.
219	"If Hancock didn't try so hard to be ""edgy"" and ""different"" it could have been a winner. Instead with the only villain in the movie being a Whiskey bottle it barely registers as a blip on the radar."

224	A delight, rising well above the standard animated action formula.
225	Though something less than a masterpiece of the genre, this good-natured skirmish in the war between men and women benefits from Hudson's thoroughly charming performance.
226	Refreshingly, it's actually about action, albeit arbitrary action, and how it defines us and keeps us alive.
227	A fine cast salvages an indie-drama boilerplate
228	Stallone, with his highly unusual current face, is so busy making googly eyes at Statham and nursing a man-crush that he forgets that the goal of this movie is MORE KILLING.
229	Modestly entertaining Rock Dog should satisfy young children.
230	Rocky loses his fortune, moves back to the old neighborhood and neglects his son while training an ultimately ungrateful young boxer. A manufactured attempt to capture the spirit of the original. What's intended as high drama is cloying and silly.

240	It is too long, too dumb, and too gross. But sometimes funny.
241	Its no-bones-about-it message of how global climate change is challenging our furry -- and blubbery -- animal friends at the top of the world is critical and makes the film something everyone concerned with the environment should see.
242	Offers a vivid glimpse of a fascinating moment in musical history, racial politics and global pop culture.
243	Might've reached a more fulfilling creative explosion with someone else in the lead role, though it would difficult for anyone to shine in a feature that would prefer ingesting poop to exploring the nuances of a sexual awakening.
244	This serio comedy about an eccentric Southern family is a minor work in Altman's oeuvre, but it's well acted and enjoyable.
245	The execution just didn't live up to the clever premise. If we aren't going to get into the heads of these characters as they witness the havoc they wreak, then director should have kept up the satirical tone of the
246	[Moore] almost carries the film beyond disease-of-the-week blandness, but both Sarah Polley's Away from Her and Michael Haneke's Amour mined deeper and more surprising material from the familial fallout.
247	Didactic rather than dramatic, and schematic rather than realistic, Sayles' femme-driven yarn, set in an anonymous place, lags behind the zeitgeist with little to say about the issue of adoption or First vs. Third World countries.
248	In comparison, Jersey Shore looks like something that might appear at Lincoln Center.
249	Singer does a superb job at creating suspense in a story where everyone in the audience already knows the outcome.
250	The overall purpose of Live Flesh, the latest and reputedly most 'mature' work from Spanish bad-boy director Pedro Almodovar, remains engigmatic.
251	Juvenile in the worst sense: confused and frightened by the adult world, and begging to be protected.
252	The fact that Allen never explains how Bender bends time is a wise choice, there's no bogging down of the narrative which allows the flick to keep skipping along at a effervescent pace.
253	Maybe Jackson should avoid any more movies with 'snake' in the title.
254	Offers mainstream America a look at Shakur's immense talent and the ever-expanding world of hip-hop music.
255	Unless you've seen every awful horror flick of the past five years, you won't even get the jokes. A comedic dead zone.
256	This didn't pain me anywhere near as much as I thought it would. A money-grab, surely, and Clint's weird bush story is very awkward, but generally charming enough for a date with a boring person.
257	Very stylish.
258	Jeong's evocative visuals of the urban landscape and her savvy deployment of appliances only deepens the resemblance such stories have to our own lives.
259	A film that, despite its failures, which are not few, meets the most essential promises. In the film there are even, and must not forget, those doses of dark humor that helped give Trainspotting a unique and special tone. [Full review in Spanish]
260	The passing of two decades can take the piss out of these era-defining Nineties rebels. Still, there's a hard-won wisdom at work here, as well as an aching sense of loss. .
261	By the end I felt someone had put my brain in a blender.
262	Not to be missed by anyone who cares about the joys, sorrows, and challenges of living in the modern world.
263	Lesser Mel Brooks has some funny bits if homelessness is funny at all
264	Kaurismaki doesn't favor heavy strokes on his cinematic canvas, and there's little else to the plot. But what's there is plenty for this talented writer-director to explore.
265	I'm not sure which will take longer to heal: the welt on Johnny Knoxville's stomach from a riot-control projectile or my own tortured psyche.
266	This film is way more about tits and ass and drugs and guns and California muscle cars and busting up house parties with kung fu than it is about deep characterization or the epic scale of Scarface.
267	Oh for the days when Verhoeven was still in Holland.
268	An engaging ride, with some quicksilver moves.
269	a movie that dares to challenge the audience
270	Creative and extremely fun to watch.
271	Handsomely filmed but disappointing.
272	John Ford certainly has a right to some Irish blarney
273	Logan Lucky is a hoot, a holler, a drag at times and doesn't know when to end but it's fun.
274	Bad Lieutenant doesn't go where you expect, but it has a stubborn, trippy logic.
275	[Foster is] terrific in the part, and the movie is great fun.
276	Altogether, the effort is bound to tug at the heartstrings, and many audiences will be perfectly happy with the results.
277	What Brewer may be doing, other than having a blast, is dragging a lot of ghosty old racial-sexual prejudices out into the disinfecting sunshine to be laughed at as they shrivel and die.
278	It sends its audience sprawling. It swerves past our preconceptions. 
279	Cheadle makes all these things believable within the same person while showing how being pulled in several directions wears on Petey.
280	Cinematic pop art
281	It's fun to see this aging cast together on screen, but the movie is junk. The one-liners aren't funny, the dialogue is tedious, and the action itself is prosaic and repetitive.
282	Lee's film never recaptures the impact of the opening credit sequence, a grimly deglamorized tableaux of real-life crime scenes.
283	The movie, through the works of Beethoven, displays the power and passion of music.
284	Sumptuous attention to detail, lush photography and beautifully understated performances
285	The cinematography by Markus Forderer is dreamy and memorable, even if the science in I Origins feels a tad half baked, even to the unschooled.
286	Generations is predictably flabby and impenetrable in places, but it has enough pomp, spectacle and high-tech small talk to keep the franchise afloat.
287	"...a killer concept, a good cast and luxe locations, all crisply photographed by Yaron Orbach, but ""The Jones"" doesn't deliver the punch it should because it's all hung on a pedestrian framework. "
288	Props itself up with allusions to Deep Thoughts but in reality is just a long action movie gussied up in special effects.
289	the film's convoluted plot and lack of genuine feeling for the characters undercut even its most impressive sequences, making it feel empty where it should be boisterous, boring when it should be at the very least intriguing
290	Ridley Scott created a triumph of retro-futuristic design over narrative or character richness.
291	a nail-biting masterpiece of suspense, operating on a philosophical level that is as sophisticated as it is compelling
292	The Bellas even know that they are past their prime and this film acts as one last hoopla for them.
293	All of the performances are right on the money, and the flick's snappy style continually pays off with good times.
294	As the romantic mystery develops, the light comedy keeps us amused. 
295	The jokes are frequent, rapidly fired, and often sharply written, featuring crude sexual dialogue about everything imaginable from masturbation to states of sexual arousal.
296	...a lot of the stuff started to feel a little too melodramatic and just didn't click for me.
297	It's predictable but ultimately moving; a glimpse of a bond near-broken yet straining to become whole again.
298	It's a safe, inspirational film, but it's an exceedingly well crafted one.
299	Lee's intimate visual style brings us closer to the rawness of his characters, but the realistic look exposes the artifice of filmmaking. Watching Billy Lynn feels like watching actors making a movie. 
300	So slow, cold and aloof that it's almost off-putting. As a result, it's hard to care much about what happens to any of these characters.
301	You can't shake the sense that the real Vinny Paz is far more fascinating than this basic boxing biopic.
302	As puppetry, Team America is stilted. As satire, it's gutless and lazy. And as comedy, it barely delivers laughs.
303	The film gets a full 'This is a work of fiction' disclaimer, even noting that any resemblance to any person living or dead is unintentional. That tells you something about how much trust to put in these historical CliffsNotes.
304	Writer-director David Twohy is too much in love with his hipper-than-thou dialogue, but he plants some sneaky scares along the trail.
305	An unforgettable powerhouse.
306	Spielberg is less assured in the department of character development and some of the actors give worse performances than the computer-generated creatures, but, with a landmark spectacle like this, who cares?
307	If only he could have satisfied himself with this area of expertise, people would still talk of Steve Martin as one of the kings of comic cinema.
308	It's funny without being ridiculous, sweet without turning sentimental, even though it involves parenthood.
309	A non-stop head-bobbing knee-bouncer.
310	In addition to having a wonderful conceit as the basis of the plot and featuring two superlative lead performances, the film pays homage to its inspiration.
311	Pfeiffer is outstanding.
312	As thoroughly researched as any documentary in recent memory.
313	[The Tourist] is very entertaining and thoroughly enjoyable from the very start and doesn't let up until the screen goes black, which is something that very few films are able to pull off nowadays.
314	Stick two fingers up at the moral majority... then shove them in the High Voltage socket and get ready to have your socks blown off.
315	Enjoy it for what it is; you can hate yourself later.
316	The film is little more than a showcase for Atkinson's broad slapstick comedy, overdone facial contortions, and bathroom humor.
317	Not a great movie by any stretch, but hugely entertaining nonetheless.
318	The world doesn't end with a whimper, but with ingenious laughter, making this off-the-chart genre-bending comedy the funniest and most original movie of the summer.
319	The best thing about Hello, My Name Is Doris is that nothing gets resolved in the expected movie fashion. The story will make you laugh, no question, but it will also make you deeply uncomfortable, and we mean that in the best way.
320	An extremely difficult but worthy film, whose true horror lies in the certain knowledge that however brutal it may seem, the reality of Auschwitz was worse.
321	War of the Worlds takes one of our deepest global fears, the threat of annihilation, and gives us a catharsis when humanity reasserts itself.
322	The movie as a whole isn't exactly ground-breaking, and some of the humor tanks. But it has enough action, laughs and candy-hued visuals to satisfy the target audience without plunging grown-ups into despair.
323	Who knew reincarnation could be such a lovely snooze?
324	It's Paul Walker escaping with his costume from Castle Cameos Pictures at the Las Vegas Excalibur.
325	The combination of its casual violence, its street sense and a loose cinematography makes the film feel like a documentary.
326	You ... have to swallow a by-the-numbers plot buried under an avalanche of fast-and-furious but underwhelming CGI effects.
327	Peter Jackson's return to swords, sorcery and beards deserving of their own postcodes is fantasy how it ought to be.
328	May not maintain quite the same frantic level of invention as the Wallace and Gromit shorts, but it has more heart.
329	Outside of a smart performance by Shawn Hatosy as Tim Dunphy, there just isn't much that's enlightening or new in this intimate recollection.
330	This is a society you will recognise - for Carol goes well beyond Carol.
331	Probably not the best movie you'll see all year, but it might just be the most special one.
332	She's fascinating and tough ... wish the film was a bit more like her. It's a warm dragon, rather than a fiery one.
333	Although Selma is dramatically uneven overall, the film is a commendable historical drama that sidesteps the pitfalls of adulatory biopics and great-man approaches to encapsulating bygone events.
334	It's the kind of cutesy idea that doesn't ring remotely true.
335	Everything is so calculated and phoney that you don't believe a word of it.
336	Meet the Fockers is not much of a movie -- just a lot of comic situations barely held together by the semblance of a plot -- but it is genuinely funny in a crass way.
337	The movie Wild Wild West should have been.
338	I can virtually guarantee you won't see anything else like it this year.
339	Dutifully reproduces incidents and particulars while only rarely glancing at the underlying element of self-deception, of acting a part, that defines said moments.
340	Thomas's offering may not be earth-shattering but does induce a tingly sensation.
341	One cannot rely on any critic for this film because a biased opinion lies behind every review.
342	The fights are so many and so long and the cuts so quick that you can rarely tell who's winning. One thing is certain, the losers are the viewers.
343	Safety Not Guaranteed rewards those willing to ditch cynicism for a playful world where anything is possible.
344	Uses its eroticism as a head trip into loneliness, alienation and desperation.
345	It's so messed up, confused, and cheap that even the sight of Picard and Kirk fighting together can't save it.
346	It's all curiously rote, though: The cars go really fast, and then, for a change, they go really, really fast.
347	...it's not made for critics, and it's not made for most moviegoers. While it's tempting to suggest that people interested in this particular period of American history ought to read a book, Gods and Generals might suffice as a watchable Cliffs Notes.
348	There's a general lack of subtlety -- the filmmakers try too hard to be zany or meaningful and rarely get either right.
349	Filled with moments of pure bliss, this deeply touching film is a romance for the ages.
350	An enormously likable film.
351	Watchable British comedy, enlivened by strong performances from a talented comic cast, though it's not quite as funny as it thinks it is and some of the gags fall painfully flat.
352	This is a poignant and entertaining affair, with enough of a satirical edge not just to seem like an exercise in cosy British nostalgia.
353	The ill-conceived Hannibal Rising plays sort of like how Death Wish might have turned out had Charles Bronson's vigilante been a bloodthirsty cannibal.
354	Sadly, the bar is set too high and the movie implodes under the weight of its own ambitions.
355	Evelyn has little to do with real life. For a more realistic true story, try this: Clueless moviemakers sucker innocent moviegoers into paying nine bucks for a stupid movie.
356	Will Smith is pure delight, as if we didn't know.
357	I can't help but feel that they never really figured out why to make this movie aside from the obvious exercise in homage.
358	The big monster in this movie isn't the human race, but those humans who failed to make a compelling film.
359	Michod's minimalist approach to The Rover is both its chief asset and biggest shortcoming. It's a respectable essay on survival, loneliness, trust and loss. But also one that ponders to the point of ponderousness.
360	American Violet has the necessary anger to engage its subject but also the generic topical-telefilm aesthetics that often render it glib and inauthentic.
361	Technically gorgeous... But it's such a wreck of tone and intellect.
362	Despite the charismatic central performances, Larry Crowne might be too happy-go-lucky for its own good.
363	I'm pretty sure this would have made total sense if I was on some of the drugs that McDonagh was taking
364	At times, Jane Got A Gun comes perilously close to staying passive-to becoming A Gun Was Gotten By Jane.
365	Standard cop movie with great moody music and Stallone's best performance since Rocky.
366	Perhaps if you send them a stamped, self-addressed envelope they'll tell us why this was thought to be funny.
367	The director of Three Kings asks: If all people want is cheap oil and Wal-Mart convenience, should liberals just give up?
368	"If you enjoyed the ""Bourne Identity"" you'll enjoy the ""Bourne Supremacy"" as much - just don't expect much more than that."
369	The To Do List is not just a hard R sex comedy, but also an important player in film diversification.
370	In his best role since Jerry Maguire, Cuba Gooding Jr. delivers a mannered performance performance where other actors have opted for tics and exaggerated shouting. 
371	It's goofy. I can definitely say that. But it's goofy on purpose and that's the kind of goofy we like.
372	The film's saucy mix of comedy and melodrama is one of its greatest charms, although it can give you whiplash from time to time, especially if you're not used to Ford's brand of broad, back-slapping comedy
373	...another comic book movie with a lot of special effects. ...a complete waste of time. 
374	Witherspoon's charm...has been replaced with tentativeness, confusion and the exaggerated facial expressions of a sitcom comedienne. 
375	Director Hanson skillfully creates the oppressive nature of urban poverty with the dirt, grit, and darkness that remains prevalent throughout...
376	Evelyn proves you can take an inspirational, true story with tons of potential, and with a bad script, water down the impact until nothing works exactly right.
377	Brimming with self-aware and topical comedy, Ralph and Vanellope's new adventure is even better than the last.
378	Parents will be nudging aside their children to check out the thoroughly mature western known as Rango
379	In short, The Break-Up is too accurate to be light-hearted, too light and flippant to be really romantic.
380	Merely serves to watch a company's ashes fall without really considering what started the fire.
381	this rom-com dodges the unsavory omen of its title and once again demonstrates that predictable plots aren't so bad if they involve Matthew McConaughey removing his shirt.
382	A motorless, rudderless wreck that is top-heavy with cliches.
383	Definitely marks an uptick after the last horrendous installment and it has moments that work but it ultimately fails to add anything new to the unexpected Final Destination anthology.
384	"The Imitation Game"" is both an education and a pleasure - and another chance to revel in what Cumberbatch can convey in eloquent silence."
385	If Jackson had focused simply on Bilbo's party and their attempts to get a proper homeland for the dwarves, 'The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey' would have been a leaner, more engaging tale.
386	Beautifully shot and perfectly paced, The Rider also balances precisely atop the fiction/documentary divide.
387	Clumsy, clunky puppets turn out to be a brilliant comedy delivery system.
388	The program is secure, but are we?
389	As plane-based suspense thrillers go, Flightplan has a smooth take off and cruises along nicely for a while, but it hits a rocky patch of turbulence in the third act and goes into a fatal tailspin. 
390	The script is so full of old gags it must have been chiselled on stone tablets, while Stewart Raffill's direction is a model example of how not to let the action get in the way of product placements.
391	An I, Failure.
392	Penn's camera loves the landscape and captures its immensity.
393	Nothing says summer film fun like explosions, guns and cartwheeling cars -- and that's all here.
394	You end up fearing for the humans who contact him. At the same time, you feel his rage.
395	When you attend a movie directed by Clint Eastwood, you feel like you are in the presence of greatness.
396	The best thing I can say about Doom is that it isn't nearly as bad as the vast majority of video-game-to-film adaptations.
397	Despite amusing moments and a sprinkling of catnip for film buffs, Hitchcock is disappointingly inconsequential.
398	In its own unassuming, self-effacing way, Serenity is the epic sci-fi adventure that the latter years of Star Wars could only dream of being.
399	A really pleasant surprise of a film.
400	Dumb, dumb, dumb. Did someone say Pauly Shore?
401	The film's criticism is not leveled against the war, but against the people who would deny the true nature of combat for their own ends.
402	A little long and pushy, but very well-played and at times utterly harrowing
403	The job involves an upcoming cooking contest, a sleazy mayor, a corrupt restaurateur and a supporting cast of characters so ugly, stupid and hygienically revolting that they make Larry seem almost tolerable.
404	A winning meld of stop motion animation and classic sports movie, Early Man scores big time.
405	With a master's control, Romero sets his characters in motion and against each other.
406	There can hardly be anything left to say about Citizen Kane, now revived on the big screen, other than to comment on sublime moments.
407	"Not the greatest animated action film but much better than ""Speed Racer"
408	The two leads chomp considerably more scenery with their acting than fire-breathing monsters barbecue with their breath...
409	"Logan Lucky"" is his down-home version of the ""Ocean's"" franchise, with NASCAR instead of the Bellagio, but it's every bit as cheeky, fun and funny."
410	The best parts commingle with a lot of shopworn ideas that Kevin Smith more or less milked dry a decade ago.
411	...a monstrosity from the depths of Disney Channel hell, a funhouse nightmare with no apparent exit sign
412	The story, though considerably altered to make it more dramatic, is an interesting one, and Turing and Clarke's relationship is compelling in the film. Cumberbatch and Keira Knightley both give great performances in this film.
413	Brooks is fortunate to have Nicholson in the lead, because it is by his natural charm and smirking wit that his character gets away with everything he does.
414	A cartoon classic of its time that hasn't aged well.
415	By turns very dark and very funny.
416	Please ensure that your disbelief is safely stowed in the overhead compartment, as unsecured continuity problems may otherwise hinder your enjoyment of the ride.
417	People will nit-pick at the plot and the script... but you can't look at what Spielberg has put together in the first two-thirds of this film and not be humbled and amazed.
418	...the movie remains wholly unable to capture one's interest for virtually the entirety of its plodding, padded-out runtime...
419	Oddly enough, about the first half of Pooh's Heffalump Movie could be thought of as the children's version of The Village.
420	"The look of Final Fantasy then provides food for thought: what is ""realism"" and what does it have to do with the movies? "
421	the cinematic equivalent of a Rorschach inkblot: You will probably see in it whatever you choose to see in it. 
422	"The Darkest Minds"" is in desperate need of a spark, any spark. References to ""Watership Down"" and ""Harry Potter"" only serve to show how far this film is from the classics it admires."
423	Some sharp dialogue raises this romantic comedy above the TV sitcom genre.
424	A gangster film with a twist and the idiosyncratic Demme touch.
425	Black could have easily gone for gratuitous violence - he didn't. The result is a ripping good yarn that blows the socks off the long list of comic book movies that are too dependent on computer-generated images.
426	It's an assured piece of comic filmmaking.
427	...strangely uninvolving...
428	What's so satisfying about these telegraphed messages is the earnest, old-fashioned charm that McGregor and longtime Pooh voice actor Jim Cummings bring to them.
429	I highly recommend you check this out on the big screen. 
430	Fincher's visual mastery and Pitt's charisma almost compensate for a gimmick in search of a meaning. The more time Fincher gives viewers with Button, the thinner the character grows.
431	Could it be that Peter Morgan's clout gave him the right to dredge up from his desk drawer some terrible old script? Maybe. Either way, it's one to forget for all concerned.
432	This unthrilling thriller is burdened by two superstars with no chemistry between them. There is one good line, the last one uttered, hardly worth waiting for.
433	An emotionally tone deaf and, typical of the director, gimmick-laden and aggressively polished adaptation.
434	Great first act with top-notch performances by Ashley Bell and Pat Healy.
435	It's all a creepy mishmash of sci-fi and fantasy classics that director Jorge Blanco tarts up with an unwholesome preoccupation with pee, anal plugs, and homosexual anxiety.
436	Bullock just about knocks herself exhausted being winsome and lovable.
437	Rizzo the Rat needs his own movie. Michael Caine, on the other hand, doesn't.
438	Cheap and half-assed, but not a completely torturous experience.
439	An uneven homage spoof on auteurs like Hitchcock, Powell and Ferrara.
440	While you may have trouble figuring out who's running where in the film's big climax, Stallone sets off enough explosions to ensure their Brazilian shooting location could be seen from space.
441	Keeps Gwyneth Paltrow in an irritating state of teary distress, and makes one long for the same numbing cell of bottle-clutching isolation that alcoholism gifts to the lead character.
442	Energetic performances and a strong true story lift this rather simplistic movie into something watchable
443	Disney's movie taps into our desire to believe that the happy hound sleeping at the end of our beds is as brave, noble, loyal, and devoted as he seems.
444	Here's a film fact you should tell your friends: Alfred Hitchcock was given his first directing job by... a Brummie.
445	It's just an incredibly insightful character drama about true, awkward, beautiful first love, and it's all the better for it. Oh, and that last shot is as cute as it gets.
446	Even if you wander into this congealed mess with nothing more demanding in mind than to spend a little time with two charming favorites, do not expect Forrest Gump or Pretty Woman.
447	So long-winded that it sometimes feels like the Civil War in real time.
448	There's no shortage of talent in this ensemble drama about the bond between mothers and their children.
449	House of Flying Daggers is loaded with the kinds of visual wonders that make adult moviegoers feel like giddy kids.
450	Exploring ground laid out many times before, The Savages is at times frustrating and at times emotional film that could have used a re-write.
451	American Hustle isn't a bad film... but it's certainly an overrated one.
452	The acting and effects are first-rate, and the cast and crew make sure the film's heart is in the right place.
453	"Bandslam"" is a terrific family film that showcases the importance of constructive teenage friendship."
454	Not a great movie by any stretch of the imagination, but certainly one that offers enough eye-candy and cheap thrills to entertain...
455	[Has] a wild cinematic style that suggests a lust for the new, the different.
456	I did not know what to expect going into this film. I was prepared for an offensive natured film, but I was very surprised. This film was clean and had taste.
457	[Hackman and Romano] work well together here, and Tierney does a heroic job of playing a character who doesn't know how the story will end, when everybody else, in the cast and in the audience, has an excellent idea.
458	An uninteresting and off-putting movie.
459	A deft script by Mike White ... elevates the usual teen twaddle by grounding the laughs in feeling.
460	... in spite of its flaws, I very much enjoyed Hancock, for both its interesting and creative storytelling and Smith's great lead performance.
461	Sure, the plot is preposterous, but the two stars look great, the scenery is spectacular and the supporting cast is a hoot.
462	"After aimless improv with Benigni and Waits, a binary appearance by Cate Blanchett shows us what the term ""screen star"" means. Her sample reel is tops."
463	By no means the premium Bond, but an intriguing one.
464	It is an imperative story worth telling, the importance of which manages to assuage some of the film's less than successful moments.
465	Fantastic Flop
466	So-so Connery vehicle
467	Tepid sitcom romantic-comedy that's not a bow-wow but never gets out of the doghouse.
468	All the performances are excellent with the greatest satisfaction coming when Bremner's Spud and Carlyle's Begbie are transformed from figures of fun and fear to the three dimensional characters that were missing in the original movie.
469	For now, 'The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey' is a good start, but with the expectations resting on the film, is good going to be good enough? 
470	David Zucker, who once had one of the most supple comic touches in the business, has turned into the chowderhead who keeps elbowing you in the ribs asking, 'Get it? Get it?'
471	Perfectly acted. Immeasurably funny. A great second outing for director Sofia Coppola.
472	This isn't just an exercise in mawkishness, though it's also nowhere near as emotionally resonant as it strives to be.
473	However, for all of its ferocious sexual frankness and ear-burningly colourful language, Girls Trip not only knows how to land a big laugh, but also how to sustain and magnify it.
474	An amusing look at the early days of the gangsta rappers.
475	Watching Cosmopolis, it's hard to say if you're witnessing a revelation or a crock, but you'll hang on its every word.
476	The absurdity takes away from nearly all possible mystery and suspense.
477	Feel-good themes and fine performances from Cuba Gooding, Jr., and Ed Harris make Radio a nice pre-holiday film.
478	Fassbender and Vikander are world-class actors who take an underdeveloped script and make it watchable, if not the weepfest that it's shooting for.
479	...inspires the same jaw-dropping awe as Jurassic Park and Close Encounters both did with the same mix of fantasy, horror, and the regular guy.
480	You, Me and Dupree is a situation comedy that subsists purely on vibe, namely Owen Wilson's ever-boyish vibe of an innocence that has overstayed its welcome long into adulthood.
481	The Break-Up is a pleasant surprise to the open-minded.
482	Film buffs will be hugging themselves with sheer pleasure. And ordinary filmgoers will be equally entertained by this hilarious and heart- felt tribute to the early days of Hollywood with its unmissable wild wit.
483	Pearce seethes with searing, desperate energy that's beautifully matched by Pattinson's mumbling, cautious attempts at optimism.
484	Neeson's performance as the legendary Irishman reminds us of how large a presence the actor is: He fills up the frame with his voice, his hands, and his gestures.
485	As a video game that propels the viewer through the course, Supremacy is supremely successful. I'm not sure that's enough for a movie narrative.
486	When the film gets down to its selected core of primary characters, Veronica Mars picks up like it only went off the air yesterday.
487	... funny, frightening and fabulously fun.
488	The entire film carries an air of melancholy that is not oppressive, but leaves very little room for the final endorsement of hope to have greater emotional impact. [Full Review in Spanish]
489	It doesn't stand for anything beyond the ability to stand there and mock everything.
490	Is The Predator a new low for the series? That's debatable. The fact that that's even a thought - y'know, considering how awful Alien vs. Predator: Requiem is - should tell you all you need to know.
491	A simple tale about Dog butchery, bullying, American imperialism and Korean bigotry.
492	Team America is not as funny as the South Park movie, and some of its juvenile humor falls flat. But when Team America works, it falls squarely into the category of guilty pleasure.
493	A sports flick that's a worthy addition to the genre.
494	Isn't as wacky as 'Shaun of the Dead' or 'Hot Fuzz,' but it's amusing enough to please their many fans and plenty of others besides.
495	There is much to see on this journey, all of it presented in the abundant, deep-focus detail that is Gilliam's visual trademark.
496	This stately, stagey, funereally paced contemporary drama of middle-class African-American life looks as if it could have been set almost any time in the past half-century.
497	A very good comic drama which can please a crowd.
498	It's an odd, uneasy mixture of sword-and-sandals epic and high-minded moral debate, but it's shot beautifully and there's no denying its ambition.
499	A sympathetic look at mental decline in a middle aged woman.
500	Valkyrie is a taut suspense flick for grown-ups that asks: What if ruthless German efficiency had been used against Hitler?
501	This film is about a woman trying to move mountains to make herself happy, and the singular quest of every other character in the movie is to serve her in that quest. 
502	Subpar material gets a tonal and aesthetic - and, by extension, thematic - boost from directorial virtuosity in David Fincher's American remake.
503	"'Orange County,"" happily, is an exception to the rule. It is a better-written, better directed version of the genre with few raunchy jokes."
504	Valkyrie is every bit as good as you remember a Tom Cruise movie being, back when you still liked Tom Cruise.
505	It's certainly edgier, smarter, than much of what passes for culture-clash comedy these days, even if the phlegmatic Murray sometimes resembles every Ugly American abroad, mocking waiters and sushi chefs who struggle to get his deadpan humor.
506	There is no escaping the essential flaccidity of the story.
507	It's one thing to create an R-rated soap box which to preach from, yet doing so in such a strong armed and contrived way wins neither applause nor credibility.
508	We know by now that blatant, senseless consumption is bad, harmful even. But the biggest surprise about The Joneses is its skillful avoidance of any meaning or significance whatsoever. 
509	American Psycho connects strongly in the moment, and has proven memorable over time, for the vivid impressions it makes in tone as well as look, its potent blends of sound and image, its unusual if erratic points of entry into potentially stock cha
510	Although it's debatable whether we need another boxing movie, or whether there is anything new that can be added to an overcrowded genre, this serviceable true-life comeback story has a couple of things in its favour.
511	On the whole, this film didn't make me laugh much, didn't make me 'aaaaaah' much and didn't give me any more insight into its astronomical popularity.
512	Eubank may well have a future as a cinematographer, or in the special effects business. But a filmmaker he ain't. 
513	Aside from the movie's mouthful title, this [is a] contemplative and carousing exposition. [The] prairie-induced pathos is plenty to digest with absolute reverence.
514	A suspenseful thriller which should have the audience gasping every time that the drug lords are about to expose the customs agent who has infiltrated their network.
515	Does what it promises -- gives great tense drama and action. However, jerky camera work is somewhat annoying.
516	A banal and sappy romantic melodrama
517	Though Neeson is commanding in his role, and though Felt's story is a powerful one, this political drama eventually fails to rise above an overly explanatory, visually static storytelling style. 
518	Hardball is a softball, and this umpire calls it out at first base.
519	A terrifically entertaining comedy illustrating the view that people of diverse nationalities can get along famously with one another.
520	See it in a theater on the biggest screen you can find
521	Despite moments of mounting suspense, the film suffers from stilted unevenness.
522	Cheap and half-assed, but not a completely torturous experience.
523	Rohit Shetty's action flim is fairly decent despite a predictable story.
524	Pynchon and Anderson's take on this period is more subversive, but also more of a lament than HST's ether binge.
525	Directors John Musker and Ron Clements, the team behind The Little Mermaid, have produced sparkling retina candy, but they aren't able to muster a lot of emotional resonance in the cold vacuum of space.
526	A film that wants to be the final word on haunted house horror, as its director embraces and finesses myriad genre tropes, cranking the spectacle up so far it's astonishing it shows no sign of the strain.
527	A dramatic story but not always one that engages as fully as it should. A sterling effort, not gold.
528	Unremarkable except for its subversive subtext.
529	This preachy bio pic is a hokey take on the birdman with Lancaster being misused on every occasion.
530	Clever, dark and juicy.
531	Jack Nicholson has finally met his match with a complicated role which I am convinced few besides him could manage.
532	A comic clash of stereotypical Red State and Blue State culture, but with a wish-fulfillment Hollywood ending in which 'Fockerization' triumphs...
533	All of Romero's experimentation comes to fruition in Land, which proves he has not exhausted zombies.
534	Judd Apatow is making comedies but also wants to tell relationship stories and get more serious at times, for better or worse.
535	A rich and rewarding family entertainment experience that teens and adults will thoroughly enjoy more -- as will the kids.
536	A major addition to the queer cinema canon.
537	A visually pleasing film, given to framing the characters in dappled sunlight that peeks through windblown leaves. It's a pity the rest of the project is so poorly executed.
538	It's effective as a sequel to the television series and works just as well as a stand-alone film.
539	What begins as a would-be exercise in camp devolves into perfervid tosh and ultimately tedium in The Dressmaker, a belligerently over-the-top revenge drama that might just about have squeaked by as an opera.
540	"Edge"" is the operative word, as Craig grinds the genre's conventions to a razor sharpness that cut deep and give Steinfeld a platform to tap all her best instincts in fleshing out the most loveable narcissistic cynic since Larry David."
541	Hereafter can't quite make up its mind what it is exactly about, resulting in a film that builds and builds and builds ... to nothing.
542	This film is rendered superior by the director's cut, thanks to the excising of extraneous narration and the grim yet more appropriate ending.
543	"Only the latest in a long line of forgettable, unfunny ""comedies"" in which we're supposed to care about some intrinsically unlikable slob."
544	"Will love conquer all? Probably not. The bigger question is whether it will endure. The lush, beautifully acted and shot ""Carol"" answers this with a sweet smile."
545	A lovely film that works on various levels, not least being its insistence on lush visual cues.
546	A science-fiction pastiche so lacking in originality that if you stripped away its inspirations there would be precious little left.
547	The movie makes absolutely no sense. Its underlying mythology is a hodgepodge of inconsistencies that pose the question: Since when did dumb entertainment have to be this dumb?
548	The Bourne Supremacy is essentially a string of how- will-he-get- out-this-one set pieces, but they have been cooked up with nerve-frying elan by British director Greengrass.
549	One amusing airport security sketch aside, this series must surely have had its chips.
550	Slow, ponderous and as shallow as it thinks it is deep, lifted only by an impressive opening and fine work from Damon and Howard.
551	Chuck Pfarrer's screenplay feels older than the Martian hills.
552	The most infuriating revelation in Amy Berg's powerful documentary is the lengths to which current Los Angeles Cardinal Roger Mahoney and other church officials went to protect Father O'Grady and themselves.
553	Few films handle coming of age with as much grace and humanity as Call Me By Your Name and the audience is as transformed by the experience as the characters.
554	The shootouts are epic, but the stuff leading up to them is lame.
555	It does not have the right stuff. Indeed, it is pretty silly stuff.
556	The only thing The Last Witch Hunter will successfully eradicate is insomnia.
557	If Garcia's film never quite catches up with his ambitions for it, well, at least he's trying.
558	Such slapstick actually works, reminding us that the clergy are people, too, and the Vatican runs on electricity instead of a higher power.
559	Began life as a computer game, then morphed into a movie -- a bad one, of course.
560	A pale imitation of Eastwood's Coogan's Bluff, this is one of Wayne's worst films, a UK set thriller, reflecting the Duke's last effort to expand his range and enter into the modern era of James Bond and co.
561	Aside from the subtleties found in Cheadle and Ejiofor's performances, this is biopic bombast.
562	Although it flat-lines repeatedly in episodes that feel like improvised acting exercises, the film is more than intermittently amusing and occasionally hilarious.
563	The filmmakers clearly respect Austen. So why present her as a mere stenographer, dutifully taking dictation from the world around her?
564	Reverberates with meaning throughout our current modern-day societal landscape, propelling a good biopic into a great one; Saoirse Ronan's final speech comes along and sticks the landing.
565	We've seen these character types before, but through the lens of Curtis Hanson, we suffer, carouse and dream right along with them.
566	calculated with statistical precision to function as both a patriotic call to arms and an emotional tear about a man's family in jeopardy
567	Everyone's at the top of their game for this one. Even Ernie Hudson has never been this good since.
568	A Powerful Reminder of Sacrifice and Struggle.
569	It is stylish, slick, loud and empty as the producers wanted it to be.
570	A beautiful, timeless American film whose story, characters and performances should be treasured. This is one of the year's best films and once again, Alexander Payne has given us a tender, poetic masterpiece.
571	A not-great movie made slightly better by the addition of some extra character development and breathing room, the Fantastic Four Extended Edition is a must-own for fans of the original comic book.
572	Jennifer Aniston bursts into serious acting prominence.
573	Williams' scene as Dobbs debating his presidential opponents alone is worth the price of admission to this film. It is laugh-out-loud hysterical.
574	"The Great Beauty"" is Italy's submission for best foreign language film and is one of the best of the year. It works on many levels including its excellent character study by Toni Servillo."
575	Though Sausage Party is above all else a carnally inclined cartoon, there is more to the movie than just being Pixar with a potty mouth.
576	Peter Jackson's return to Middle Earth feels familiar and unfulfilling.
577	What is most memorable is not the tragedy of the lives lost or even the number of people Schindler saved, but how such an imperfect man could have done something so perfect
578	I think its young target audience will feel a little short-changed.
579	The movie is pretty, sticky, thoroughly innocuous, and quite nice.
580	Loud and completely devoid of wit or interest, this empty-headed action movie looks terrific thanks to its big budget and heavily stylised visuals. But it's impossible to care about anything that happens.
581	Plays like a Disney version of a Zhang Yimou movie, though the end result isn't as dreadful as that designation might suggest.
582	Lost in Translation will bring in the new wave of young filmmakers who realise the power of emotion and introspection and the audience thinking for themselves.
583	Real and consequential.
584	It Comes at Night demands that its audience's work with it and the end result, whilst not always entirely satisfactory, is never less than compelling and highly watchable.
585	As you might guess, after a great deal of sniping Sophie and Charlie supposedly fall for each other. But the audience never buys it.
586	McQueen's first teaming with director Jewison is not as fun to watch as the later Thomas Crown Affair, but the actor gives a cool, understated perfromance.
587	The film is neither serious enough nor seriously funny. The farce needs to be blacker.
588	The Imitation Game does justice to a great British hero and a story of incredible triumph against impossible odds.
589	One of Tim Burton's earliest works, and quite possibly his best, when his eager energy wasn't completely swamped by his self-indulgence.
590	You'll have to check your brain at the door, but as long as you remember to pick it up on the way out, you should be fine. 
591	What power the film possesses is due mainly to the expressive performances of Fassbender and Vikander, who sweep away the murk more than any lighthouse ever could.
592	Couples Retreat is a comedy of exhaustion. But it is the comedy itself, in both concept and execution, that seems tired.
593	Cute Ally Sheedy comedy, but forgettable.
594	Shamir's propensity for scatterbrained journalism muddles the film's first half to the point of irritation.
595	"Safety Not Guaranteed"" is most vibrant and vital at its edges, in the way that the characters interact with each other while waiting for something to happen."
596	An authentic, somewhat tedious re-enactment of a historical event that was ripped from the headlines.
597	A lazy script - this incarnation uses disabilities for laughs - makes The Predator a bit of a soul-sucking experience to sit through.
598	A very nice enjoyable fluffy movie.
599	Doris may be a convenient cinematic conceit, but Field gives her real juice, moving from a timid wraith to someone who realizes to her amazement that she might be lovable.
600	A movie doesn't have to be good to be really scary.
601	...a quaint and sweet-toothed animated film that sends a constructive message...a zesty fun-filled fantasy punctuated by catchy tunes and contemplative forethought
602	The Curious Case of Benjamin Button leaves you colder than it should, and it shouldn't leave you cold at all.
603	There are worse ways to spend two hours than watching lush visuals of Venice. But the city's sinking fast -- and the same goes for The Tourist.
604	Thanks to the flashy work of the film's two editors and cinematographer, style trumps substance. Or perhaps it merely masks the lack of it.
605	a story that is at once a sly commentary on relationships, a bittersweet contemplation on the fleeting nature of youth, and a devastating satire on cultural imperialism
606	A Perfect Getaway is the rarest of film treats -- a B-movie that knows where it's going and how to get there.
607	This gothic horror opus is melodrama most foul, and I mean that in terms of concept and execution, as well.
608	It's as lame as can be, and despite sitting on the shelf for four years, it's not even bad enough to be unintentionally funny.
609	A very good film, if difficult to watch, and it contains one of the greatest performances I have ever seen.
610	Something big and different during that time of the year when something big and different is so rare.
611	...a flawless masterpiece and essential viewing...
612	A surface-level biopic that occasionally finds something more profound. This is largely thanks to Rosamund Pike's fully present performance, and less so to Heineman's efforts to amp up the conflicts that defined Colvin's life and career.
613	Effectively proves that senior citizens are not dull--provided that they'd spent time in the French Foreign Legion and rescued princesses.
614	It is disheartening on a profound level to see a group of talented actors and filmmakers come together at the height of their powers and produce something of such soul-killing drudgery as The Tourist.
615	"The Mask of Dimitrios"" may get bogged down with its storytelling structure, but don't let that keep you from enjoying yet another amazing encounter between Greenstreet and Lorre."
616	Black Nativity offers a whopping serving of Yuletide emotion. And it's a musical - with plenty of wailing and rapping on the side.
617	Eastwood and his terrific cast leave you shaken in ways that matter.
618	Familiar territory, but the Disney team still knows how to bring a story to life.
619	The film had me alternating between a sugar high and drowsiness. One minute, I struggled to keep awake; the next, I was jumping in my seat. Neither extreme is particularly pleasurable.
620	Crimson Peak is a sumptuously designed genre flick that delivers a different kind of horror from the typical ghosts-and-ghouls haunted house story.
621	Writer Petr Jarchovsky never lets events slip into silliness, successfully bringing the understated humor of his source novel to the screen.
622	How's this for an idea - a movie about Woodstock that ignores the music of the Festival and concentrates on one boring guy's ability to set it all up.
623	Amiable and affable, but only occasionally successful in making pertinent observations about the ongoing battle of the sexes.
624	Until its final act, the film is lean and alive, a visceral thrill ride designed to move audiences to the edge of their seats or maybe into their parents' laps. 
625	It has all the appearances of being a family Halloween dream, but director Eli Roth fails to keep The House with a Clock in Its Walls ticking over. 
626	...lets us indulge in childish thrills without feeling silly about it.
627	Nonsensical plotting, equally silly character interaction and groan-inducing dialogue.
628	This is a smart, hip comedy that works for adults and youngsters alike.
629	One of the worst, most inexcusably poor movies Clint Eastwood has turned out in his career behind the camera and a possible contender for one of the worst films of the year.
630	The biggest, best and most furious Fast of them all.
631	It's sufficiently grandiose and sporadically exciting to hold a viewer's attention through its duller stretches.
632	The script ... is shallow and dumb.
633	There are far too many times when the story simply looses its footing and falls into another tedious direction, leaving some angles completely dangling.
634	This was a fun film that told a good story without getting ridiculous like some of these have been in the past.
635	Hitchcock's rich and strange fable of love lost, and lost again, makes the case for him as a grand experimental artist who labored in genre cinema.
636	When it gets around to the righteous fightin' and killin' bits, The Expendables more than delivers on its promise to be the manliest movie ever made.
637	While the ending is a foregone conclusion, the journey is more clever than cute.
638	A curious cross of sex therapy and psychotherapy where nobody spends much time in bed or on the couch. 
639	Younger jacks up the action in the last third, but the air goes out of a fight movie when you can see the next jab coming.
640	David Bowers's film looks good and tries for a bit of adult interest by suggesting there might be another way other than arrant capitalism. It's not much less sophisticated than Avatar but hasn't the eye-catching novelty.
641	By avoiding this film being a straight bio-pic or relationship drama, DuVernay has created a historical and political drama that resonates today.
642	Throw in an abandoned house in the neighborhood that is suddenly occupied, a vanishing obstetrician and a first communion ceremony that goes terribly wrong, and the chill factor quickly rises.
643	Damon -- reunited with director Clint Eastwood following their work on Invictus -- makes a sincere, low-key medium, conveying information like a reporter rather than a precious mystic.
644	Thank goodness then for go-to guy Jackson. He takes what could have been a cardboard cliche role and puts flesh on it with his flamboyant intelligence.
645	Even better than the original.
646	While I found the film of average entertainment, my friend loved it.
647	If Laurel Canyon isn't quite as daring as it thinks it is, it is an always honest, often stirring movie.
648	David O. Russell has crafted an unexpectedly zany, tantalizing crowd-pleaser that's relentlessly entertaining.
649	Renee Zellwegger is the real star here, of course, and Greg Kinnear is very enjoyable too, but it's Chris Rock and Morgan Freeman that really won me over.
650	It's far better than most gimmicky horror films.
651	Bleak...and slightly barking. 
652	Silly, sloppy, and liberated from any sense of pacing or plot
653	Bening, consistently one of the best US screen actresses, is really the main reason to keep you watching.
654	The mock outrage and dry sarcasm of Seinfeld's comic persona defines the movie's hero, a worker bee with a high-pitched, often cracking whine.
655	Instead of the multi-everything family that races, parties and thieves together, Singleton unleashes spasms of sadism and innumerable leering shots of girls gone wild, albeit -- alas -- not behind the wheel.
656	Its screenplay needs not another run through the typewriter, but a first run through the shredder.
657	Surprisingly free of painful barbs.
658	Aside from a few neat flourishes, this is attention-sapping stuff, lacking texture in both its visuals and vocal performances.
659	Val Kilmer returns to the screen in The Super, a horror-mystery-thriller set in a high-rise New York apartment building. 
660	One of the first glistening droplets of the French New Wave.
661	Get On Up is enjoyable...it's about funk and a funk legend after all.
662	Jurassic Park is the most self-reflexive blockbuster ever made ...
663	In essence, a failed experiment. 
664	It's definitely a tender and insightful comedy, but it's also as crude as they come.
665	You may not quite trust Mother and Child -- its soft spots and fuzzy edges give it away -- but you can believe just about everyone in it.
666	Hardly the magnum opus for which Romero fans have been waiting.
667	There's the seed of a good satire in American Dreamz, but the film flops spectacularly due to a poorly written screenplay.
668	The most touching of family reunions.
669	It's a thin, trickledown sort of fun, broadly comparable to spending the afternoon in a mocked-up Lyons Corner House: the barrel is dutifully rolled out, but its contents prove no more intoxicating than ginger beer.
670	A passionate yet detached study of the practicalities of love - the twisty-turny route one must navigate to form any kind of relationship, and especially a type that has so many barriers thrown up in its path. 
671	Drama about untraditional parenting has sex, mature themes.
672	It foregoes the sap and the lowbrow of a lesser movie in favor of engaging creativity and a message that, through some characters' tough choices, actually resonates.
673	It has what is expected of this kind of movie, cool visual effects, martial arts action, car chases, explosions, shootouts and lots of James Bond-style gadgets.
674	There is plenty to amuse in A Million Ways to Die in the West, but it's not a very good movie. 
675	Whenever Larry isn't pensively biting on his chaw, he's barking out obscene one-liners in a guttural, noxious stream of little nasty explosions. He's a greasy, oil-burning joke jalopy.
676	A film that glides on a knife's edge of seemingly unresolvable contradictions.
677	The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo is that rare hard-R rated studio film that expertly weaves story and character development into the lascivious subject matter.
678	INVICTUS works better than it deserves to as an old fashioned,predictable entertainment. In another filmmaker's hands the Capra-corn would be just too much.
679	Is it a heist movie? A teen coming of age flick? A high school comedy? A morality play? It's sort of all of those, but really none of them, as it doesn't quite hit the mark.
680	Jarmusch demonstrates once again why he is the sultan of strange encounters.
681	In a summer drenched in CGI-effect extravaganzas, it's easy to forgive The Bourne Supremacy its occasional transparent plot device.
682	Drug movies are a fairly formulaic genre. 'The Infiltrator' has it all, but it can't beat the corpse-and-lye-filled-bathtub-eating-through-the-ceiling corrosiveness of 'Breaking Bad.'
683	Outrageous illogical resolution to what is otherwise a fine thriller.
684	"As a moviegoer, there are times when you want, say, ""Jane Eyre,"" and then there are times when a movie about really large men who drive cars really fast is just the thing. ""Fast Five"" is that latter movie, and then some."
685	Little Man is a comedy based on a single gag that's not very funny. Therefore, it's exactly one joke short of being a one-joke film.
686	Secret Window, a hack job patched together from bits of Stephen King's earlier, better stories, is such a cheeseball it ultimately subverts even Depp's considerable charm and talent.
687	Jarmusch concocts a comedic anthology that's calculated, arbitrary and inconsistent -- and so hilarious when it works that you'll forget any regrets before the last cup is downed.
688	The movie doesn't really want to be all that heartbreakingly true.
689	Without core chemistry, the already flimsy plot is unbelievable. Without any sexual tension, the fate of the Hudson-Dillon marriage is irrelevant. Without any reason for Wilson to cut up and caper, why watch him do it?
690	These are questions one is left with -- and that's not an entirely satisfying feeling. Yet it's hard not to be drawn into the story, and even more, into the gorgeous storytelling.
691	Take a walk with Billy and Academy Award winning director Ang Lee and see the horrors of war and the emptiness of canned spectacle.
692	Bright, sunny and almost instantly forgettable, even Jerry Seinfeld can't stop Bee Movie from boldly going where far too many CGI animations have gone before.
693	"Radiantly human even as, and after, it erupts in violence and rage, ""Something Wild"" remains an astonishing rarity - a bittersweet romantic tragicomedy that's generally optimistic ... but also hesitant and harmful exactly where it needs to be."
694	Logan Lucky is intelligent comedy presented through absolute stupidity, and I feel lucky to have watched it.
695	Watching bear cubs and walrus pups struggling to survive against increasingly tough odds, and on ever-slushier ice shelves, has both its shamelessly manipulative side and its dramatically necessary side, as handled here.
696	As the old adage goes, you can't polish a turd. But you can sprinkle plenty of CGI and countless close-ups of Keanu Reeves looking morose onto it.
697	It's enough that these two castaways are friends, but I guess friendship doesn't cut it when you're trying to create a star-driven hit. It should, though. Better a believable friendship than an unbelievable love affair.
698	With [everything] going for Secondhand Lions, it's a shame McCanlies can't leave well enough alone.
699	For the first time, perhaps ever, Disney turns the reflecting mirror at itself, allowing for some inspired fun at its own expense.
700	It reconfirms the filmmaker's talent as an acutely observant chronicler of upscale bohemian subcultures.
701	Murray's performance really is one of very few saving graces in this truly underwhelming piece of cinema. 
702	We Bought a Zoo drops the cynicism, wears its heart on its sleeve and doesn't mind laying it on thick in an effort to move you. Which it does-whether you like it or not. 
703	The plot unfolds like a slasher-by -the-numbers kit.
704	Soderbergh, back from a self-inflicted hiatus, is the perfect man to bring this Rebecca Blunt screenplay to life, utilising his experience in this sub-genre to triumphant effect.
705	Things pick up with the latter pieces, which were shot independently of any ongoing Jarmusch production and consequently feel less like outtakes, afterthoughts.
706	With some parents hurting their kids in real life because they believe they are possessed, the whole tone of this absurd movie is inappropriate.
707	What makes Call Be By Your Name stand out from the films it will be compared to is Guadagnino's play on juxtapositions, which go much deeper than merely an angsty teen with an introspective soul.
708	Cinematic fan-fiction for the show's most impassioned audience, Veronica Mars is everything fans could have hoped it would be.
709	Mainly remembered for Marvin's Oscar-winning comedic performance
710	It is a million miles away from the frizzy haired bunny-boiling vixen of Fatal Attraction but every bit as disturbing.
711	Under the supervision of Linha de Passe co-director Daniela Thomas, this emotionally wrenching period drama is culturally and historically valuable.
712	Has a lower gag rate and more punchline misses than its predecessor. In short, it's a film that just reeks of having no real purpose.
713	With its sly wit, dark intelligence and tense action sequences this film re-establishes the Coens as two of American cinema's most talented directors. It's also the best adaptation of McCarthy's work to date and an unmissable crime movie.
714	Like Dr. Ross and her companions, the movie artfully mimics life without ever truly living.
715	What happens when smart people set out to make a dumb movie. They made the movie they wanted to watch, rather than the one anyone else might want to.
716	More a double than a home run, but worth a look.
717	... engaging, constantly warm and funny, and very direct in its ambitions.
718	This is one of those films where the filmmaker takes you on an audacious journey and makes you believe every moment of it. A nice debut from Trevorrow and Connolly.
719	plays out with ferocious brilliance
720	One for the history books, and tremendous fun to boot.
721	What is surprising about this effective little thriller is how cleverly writer-director David Twohy toys with the conventions of the genre as they exist today.
722	This is the blackest film noir in years, and a great American movie.
723	As French crime thrillers go, this is about as good as it gets. It's also an important film historically, and to top it off, the jazz score, by Miles Davis, is famous in its own right.
724	While not quite the equal of the novel, it's more complex, emotionally-charged and better acted than the average Hollywood thriller.
725	Unnatural but kind of remarkable.
726	Basically just a bunch of silly spoof scenes cobbled together around a thin premise, it allows the Wayans brothers to have fun in the way a group of kids might have fun with a video camcorder, except with a multi-million-dollar budget.
727	"If you like ""Lifestyles of the Rich and Famous,"" you'll like this film about fashion icon Valentino. But it's an absorbing, fly-on-the-wall documentary regardless."
728	Daring, delusional and downright devilish, Black Snake Moan soaks in its molasses-driven melodrama with an unctuous confidence and biting creativity.
729	You're not going to walk out of this one with a smile on your face, but you're going to be happy that you saw it.
730	Knows its formula well enough to run its finger along the grooves quick and smooth.
731	Ham-handed revenge-porn.
732	...an epic film that's part literary treatise, part mournful ballad, and completely a portrait of our world, as seen in a distant mirror.
733	It helps that Koreeda's way with atmosphere is in full effect. The film has tranquil settings, fresh-food meals, cherry blossoms and soothing breezes; watching it is a good way to clear your head.
734	It is no classic but it is stylish, absorbing and wonderfully put together.
735	The acting matches the action
736	Walking into Two Weeks Notice at the end of a hectic day, week, month and year, I wanted it to be a typical romantic comedy starring those two lovable people, Sandra Bullock and Hugh Grant. And it was.
737	The story is too clunky and overstuffed, and its flaws are even more glaring when spotlighted against stellar country music dramas. 
738	The unalloyed joy of seeing one of the greatest actors of all time hamming it up as one of the greatest directors of all time is but one of the delights offered by this cheeky, deeply affectionate pic. 
739	The problem is not that they repeat formulas for this sequel or that all of it is a bad copy of its predecessor...the bad thing is that feeling of an adulterated product. [Full review in Spanish]
740	"Words like ""gentle"" and ""sweet"" were undoubtedly tossed around by the folks who made ""Larry Crowne."" I wonder if they ever got around to ""boring?"
741	Fortunately, the dry, courtroom banter is interjected with powerful accounts of the violent, inhumane atrocities inflicted on the slaves by Spanish merchants.
742	Like all great fables, it grows out of a particular time and place, but it takes its strength from universal sorts of feelings.
743	A technological marvel and visual triumph.

746	Like a lot of movies, Astro Boy has been designed to function on different levels and serve different audiences, but in this case these multiple meanings and points of address have created a confusion of tone.
747	Brutally violent, grotesquely gross and funny enough to make you fight not to wet your pants, Team America: World Police pegs the R-rated raunch meter.
748	If The Fugitive starred an invincible super-spy and was shot with a broken Steadicam...you'd have this half-decent, hyperactively edited, arms-length chase thriller. 
749	[The film] was directed by Prince, and he does a good, sound job without finding an answer to the problem of all directors of rock concert films: After you have exhausted the basic repertory of obvious shots and audience reactions, what do you do then?
750	This overstuffed bit of fluff can't muster much in the way of excitement. It offers a yawn-inducing, sketchy and fairly questionable version of historical events.
751	This is another one of those dreary retreads about a bunch of kids with no faith in themselves, and about how an inspiring teacher coaches them into the State Finals, where they upset the snobs from the rich school.
752	An engaging, time-tripping Holden Caulfield.
753	If it only took craftsmanship to make a haunted house movie, The Changeling would be a great one.

757	This is when the Rocky series went from 'good' to 'horrible crap.'
758	It will draw audiences who want to see topical humor, and it will bog them down in a typical thriller, before capping things off with an earnest yet cautious political statement.
759	A workmanlike product that offers occasional, small moments of satisfaction, but, as a whole, is apt to leave audiences wondering why they should care.
760	A sad, undeniably thoughtful depiction of midwestern eccentrics regretting the past and growing bored of the present -- ideas that Payne regards with gentle humor and pathos but also something of a shrug. 
761	Only a Scrooge of a critic could cavil about its sentimentality.
762	Watching this pun-filled cartoon is like falling into a tray of children's watercolors -- the warm end, where oranges and yellows and ambers wave.

764	"This is just a big rollercoaster of a movie, filled with dazzling effects and funny creatures and the requisite five-hankie ""I love you, Mom"" ending. But then, there are some weird gender political battles at play here."
765	Allen wants you to love Paris as much as Gil does and wants to show you the magic, the romance and the spark the city holds for him.
766	Knocked Up is comic chicken soup for the Colbert Nation soul.
767	The briskly paced drama of a religious opportunist, his colleagues and his times utilizes the tools of the motion picture in expert fashion.
768	The story is surefire, like a good Swiss Family Robinson episode revised for a boys' issue of Aviation Week.
769	Overrated and somewhat derivative, Swimming with Sharks is a reasonably good time but honestly doesn't have a whole lot to say.
770	Simply uses the test as a reason to assemble six teen stereotypes.
771	Sporadically enjoyable but instantly forgettable.
772	Another crude slapstick effort.
773	The Artist is drunk on the history of cinema and art, and culture buffs will get giddy on it.
774	The chances of it actually 'crossing over' are nil.
775	...so seductive, you might not notice there is a troubling streak of hedonism at its core.
776	Mara and Blanchett make for an unforgettable couple in a beautiful film about longing, loss and the confusion and wonder of love.
777	It's all mechanically done, but at least I Robot manages to be entertaining. 
778	At its best, it recalls Star Wars and Raiders Of The Lost Ark in the way it joins of-the-moment technology with the sturdy rhythms and easy thrills of an old B-movie.
779	It feints at a parable for paranoia in an age of weaponized information. Instead, it's a reminder that what we love can be quickly ripped from us. After all, who knew when they woke up Sunday that the Cloverfield franchise would be dead hours later?
780	I didn't laugh much, I didn't smile much and I certainly didn't care much for any of its characters.

782	Besides the few chuckles I had, the movie was just dreadfully bad.

786	like watching the Pamela Anderson and Tommy Lee sex tape... without the sex
787	The Princess Blade would have been better off forgetting the love story and concentrating on the kick-ass action.
788	We get the sense at times that the cast and crew arrived at a location, found the script bankrupt of real laughs, and started looking around for funny props.
789	[Close gives] an intriguing performance, technically flawless, if by necessity distant.
790	"The Miracle Season"" is a wonderful movie for sports enthusiasts, families or anyone who appreciates old-fashioned, heartfelt storytelling."
791	The biggest takeaway from Billy Lynn's Long Halftime Long though is that Joe Alwyn, a British actor capable of astonishingly nailing a heavy southern drawl accent, just became a star in his debut performance
792	"Albert Nobbs"" is a film of great texture and tenderness, and the actors are a joy to behold."
793	Part thriller, part mind-bending absurdity, it will definitely leave you scratching your head. But try to stay until the end--it might make up for the rest of it.
794	...a watchable yet disappointing work from a filmmaker whose best days are clearly behind him.
795	Adventurous, challenging and filled with small moments of delight. Unfortunately, it's also self-indulgent, repetitious and the sort of movie you wish was great but isn't.
796	Perhaps the most ambitious film of his career.
797	more entertaining than any Ben Affleck-J-Lo material that Hollywood has produced during the last few years
798	Bardem's Silva is a throwback to a more traditional Bond villain, with equal parts creepy sensuality, intelligence, and psychopathy, and a touch of physical deformity for good measure.
799	Refreshing in its honest simplicity.
800	A modest drama, but Moore's heart-wrenching and Oscar-nominated performance makes this a must-see.
801	A vividly crafted and cunning whodunit.
802	A great idea is weighed down by an over-egged screenplay, but the setting and cast bring out its best.
803	It's soap -- soap with culture -- but still soap.
804	If you're looking for something the whole family can watch, this is fine. If you're an adult wondering if you need to see it, the answer is no.
805	Even at their eye-filling best, these sequences generate more spectacle than suspense.
806	"Soul Power"" is an imperfect social document of a time when anything seemed possible. Here's proof that Michael Jackson never had a thing on James Brown."
807	Christopher Robin, a derivative but enjoyable take on the Winnie the Pooh characters, contains enough of the original property's charm to win through - largely due to the wonderful voice work from long-time Pooh vocal actor Jim Cummings.
808	Mildly captivating albeit one-sided and over-simplified. It merely presents a reader's digest overview of climate change solutions [that's] more overwhelming than inspirational.
809	In a time where fashion is reduced to tawdry reality shows, Valentino: The Last Emperor reinjects the sophistication and elegance in what some say is a lost art form.
810	Dumb, raunchy comedy is a tired spoof attempt.
811	This haunting drama is a spiritual, perhaps more understated cousin of The Wrestler , handled with a deft, tender touch.
812	Dominion is only incrementally better than Exorcist: The Beginning and, with both films sharing so many story elements, Harlin is guilty of merely rearranging the deck chairs on Schrader's Titanic.
813	As shallow as the Venetian scenery is beautiful with a preening Jolie and a lackluster Depp stuck in what appears to be a painstakingly long travel commercial.

818	Following the plot is like trying to pin a watermelon seed to the table with your fingertip, where the harder you push, the farther it squirts away. As bonkers and hard to get through as an actual Pynchon novel. 
819	Surprisingly good Vonnegut adaptation
820	The Bourne Supremacy is something of a double rarity: an exciting, intelligent Hollywood thriller and a worthy sequel to boot.
821	"Let's face it; Parker and the rest of the cast could do this with their eyes closed. It's the cinematic equivalent of a ""stop gap"" -- just something to fill in the time until a proper role comes along. "
822	A gruesome, greasy bucket-load of uninhibited tastelessness. And I mean that in the nicest possible way.
823	It's impeccably stylized, but that only makes it seem more like hand-me-down Wes Anderson, a vaporous amassment of quirk.
824	It's the scab of decades-old tension between those involved in the experiment and its aftermath that Marsh wants to pick at; and it doesn't take much prodding before the conflicts and petty human jealousies rise to the top.

830	The Incredibles is so jammed with entertainment that, at two hours, it's almost too much.
831	Marlon Wayans on his own has taken his family name lower than ever before... even lower than White Chicks.
832	The history and anecdotes are still poignant -- leave to Cameron, a master showman, to actually cull one more bit of drama and pathos from this insanely overexposed subject.
833	Carnage Park is an exploitation movie down to its very bones, but writer-director Mickey Keating never really finds a handle on which sort of throwback film he wants to make.
834	Bleed for This is utterly devoid of tension, making for a limp entry in the fighting-film lineage.
835	Rosamund Pike is an absolute wrecking ball here. She embraces this complicated character and gives it her entire soul as an actress.
836	The film's relative lack of any actual drama in the narrative is ultimately the result of a biographical approach too dedicated to flattery.
837	It has far more strengths than weaknesses, but I can't put it close to his twin masterpieces All That Heaven Allows and Imitation of Life.
838	a visual marvel of expressionistic deep-focus cinematography, elaborate production design, and varied editing rhythms
839	No one's got their game on in Doom.
840	Actor John Krasinski deserves credit for having the ambition to adapt material as difficult as David Foster Wallace's short stories.

843	The story is kind of a mess, but Wizards goes beyond your standard sword and sorcery tale into some heavy surrealism.

849	This is a tragedy with laughs, not a comedy.
850	There's an endearing, almost Fitzcarraldo-like irrational obsession to his character that keeps you from rolling your eyes as he continues his silly quest to indulge his ego.

852	Meet the Parents builds brilliantly on interlocking comic situations.
853	"... ultimately, ""Mark Felt: The Man Who Brought Down The White House"" just feels lightweight."
854	Innocent Blood is an uncomfortable marriage of vampires and mobsters; it doesn't work on either the supernatural or the criminal level.
855	The results are like Kinski's performance: baffling, breathtaking and strangely beautiful.
856	An above-average and sometimes surprising kid movie based on the first of a popular series of cartoon books by Jeff Kinney.
857	Sometimes, I can almost hear the studio executives talking before a film gets the green light. 
858	the footage is stunning, the narration, not so.
859	American Dreamz succeeds, partially because it feels so good to see these parade floats skewered and deflated. But the real triumph here is that Weitz bothers to take aim at all.
860	Unlike the geisha, this adaptation does wear its heart on its sleeve, but a fine cast, including the regal Michelle Yeoh, create a picture of composure.
861	There's a deep, sad yearning that permeates through the fantastical optimism of Secondhand Lions that gives it the cold, harsh edge of reality.
862	It all adds up to a rewarding work of unusual density.
863	Viewers deserve more, as does the legacy of the now laughably ridiculous Lecter.
864	Matthew McConaughey and Sarah Jessica Parker are two likable actors with the absolute worst taste in roles. At least putting them together means only one bad movie will ensue rather than two, individually.
865	Preserving a sense of hope for today's children, there is too much in this film that is too hard to believe.
866	...may be shamelessly superficial but it's still an entertaining comedy.
867	An almost non-stop parade of snazzy, state-of-the-art visual effects and fast-paced, breathtaking action set pieces.
868	In a movie this overloaded with dudes, of course Munn is the stand-out. She proves herself a true action hero, battling with fists and brains, and getting her share of witticisms to deliver.
869	Mission accomplished.
870	Every once in a while human nature expresses itself in a way we can feel good about, and this is one of those times.
871	...a decidedly thin premise that's employed to watchable yet far-from-spectacular effect by director Ang Lee...
872	American Hustle ultimately establishes itself as yet another disappointment from David O. Russell...
873	In its dark heart, the film is a sorrowful contemplation of love and the veils that manipulate sexual passions.
874	An eerie, playful thriller and an all-around entertaining time at the movies.
875	Like its subject, can't climb above earlier, more successful moments.
876	Funny without being glib, serious without being pretentious or depressing, this is a mature movie with fully realized characters and fine performances.
877	At some point during the film, when my pessimism ought to have overwhelmed the occasion, I simply forgot I was an adult and descended freely into the material.
878	Carefully made, involving and old-fashioned.
879	I didn't care if any of these characters lived or died.
880	The moral here is that no challenge is insurmountable if you form a club. And keep a wine opener handy.
881	...the Coens sabotage their wonderfully understated style in No Country with the trivial substance of their narrative.
882	Kallen's interesting story has been pulped, if not pulverized, as a Rocky rouser.
883	Brief moments of visceral fire allow glimpses into the rousing movie this could have been.
884	Everyone with the exception of the bureaucratic inspector emerges likable as do all of the good-natured animals.
885	In telling the story of Elizabeth's ill-fated cousin, Mary Queen of Scots sheds the bonds of the old costume drama by adding a modernist/feminist twist into the mix. Features outstanding work by Margot Robbie.
886	This sequel, like most, is inferior to the original, but it is hard not to like these characters.
887	The Passion of the Christ is painstakingly true to its source material, neither editorializing nor embellishing upon what is taught each week in thousands upon thousands of churches across the globe.
888	As odd as it is enduring, Michael Showalter's Hello, My Name is Doris is a rare character-driven comedy that hinges upon the believability of its central relationship
889	The story carries less urgency as it ticks along, frittering away its energy amid all the special effects and sight gags.
890	In a world that has lost grasp of the real values in life, The Passion of the Christ is a timely piece that makes you reflect on the true worth of faith and love.
891	I wanted to like Skyfall more than I did, which is funny because after the opening sequence, I felt sure I would love it.
892	A stale reminder of what once seemed new and fresh...done up with frenetic dash that reeks more of desperation than inspiration.
893	Haynes tells us that, thrillingly, passion burns hotter than fear.
894	Although Inherent Vice looks good enough to justify the price of seeing it in a theater, it's the rare movie that feels as though it were made to be viewed from a beanbag chair.
895	The title suggests there are no easy answers. So why does everything feel so tidy?
896	An underwhelming heist-gone-wrong movie that, inexplicably, has avoided going straight to DVD.
897	Westfeldt clearly illustrates the various hurdles in parenting and relationships...in the priviledged world of successful New Yorkers.
898	As it nears a conclusion, the picture becomes almost as empty as the title character.
899	Insufferably boring, culturally hegemonic, and profoundly ugly.
900	Wonderful family entertainment.
901	Spousal-abuse thriller has violence and language. 
902	Some movies are train wrecks. This one is chum.
903	A slick, smarter-than-your-average-bear heist comedy that moves and grooves with all the hallmarks of a Soderbergh caper. He's back, baby.
904	More infamous for its widespread ineptitude than for its artistic innovation... [Blu-ray]
905	Would make a terrific half-baked double bill with American Dreamz.
906	"Will Toula have an enormous, boisterous and eccentric family? Absolutely. Will Ian's parents be the most uptight white people this side of a ""Saturday Night Live"" skit? Of course. Will love conquer all in the end? You bet."
907	Those who anticipate the twist ending are likely to leave the theater feeling conned themselves..
908	Theron's great, but as with so much of the indie-film scene on display these days, Monster has a kind of cookie-cutter look, feel and sound to it.
909	There's something rather bland about Veronica Mars ... But the one-liners are sharp, the plot unpredictable and the whole thing ticks along with a minimum of fuss.
910	Fails for all the reasons you'd expect it to fail.
911	It helps to let yourself get lost in David Cronenberg's Cosmopolis, which adapts Don Delillo's novel and clings hard to the inscrutable, arcane language, which very deliberately keeps the audience at arm's length
912	...ultimately right in line with its passable yet far-from-memorable predecessor.
913	A decent MGM musical that is winsome only in its many Irving Berlin numbers.
914	Meet the Fockers doesn't have the shabby feel of some faltering movies, but its repetitive gags and toilet humor take much of the luster off the Focker-Byrnes wedding.
915	Mostly this is one long, loud, stupid road picture. 
916	It's about something important, the search for meaning and happiness, about finding one's inner life amid the clutter and confusion of modern existence.
917	One of the least convincing political satires of the millennium so far - no bite, no vision and no laughs.
918	House Of Flying Daggers, veteran Chinese master Zhang Yimou's followup to Hero, is not strictly a sequel but it is a glorious companion piece.
919	Imagine the American students in The Real Cancun as if they were literate, cosmopolitan and not substance abusers, and you've got it.

921	When Team America runs out of ideas, Parker and Stone turn into a couple of obnoxious kids running around in circles giving the finger to everyone they see.
922	Never dull -- no mean feat, given that it spends two hours telling a story whose end is widely known -- and features performances that range from coarsely effective to phenomenal.
923	Though back by popular demand, consider this edition of Veronica Mars compelling enough even to hold the attention of folks unfamiliar with the original TV show. 
924	It's a studied movie that gives itself over to bursts of intensity, and between them sometimes threatens to become as spellbound by its subjects as they become with each other.
925	A host of charismatic character actors, including Jean Reno, Laurence Fishburne and Matt Dillon, slum it about amiably in Armoured, a B-movie action thriller, before it all implodes in the final unbelievable act.
926	[Cohen] has a knack for making the most ridiculous material suspenseful.
927	Denmark's enfant terrible Lars von Trier finally won the Camme Palme d'Or for this postmodern deconstructive musical featuring a stunning performance by Bjork.
928	For its celebration of the universal yearning for answers to the big questions, Hereafter is an interesting film to look at. It gets more interesting when you factor in a couple of impressive special effects -- yes, in a Clint Eastwood movie.
929	Aileen Wuornos for Dummies
930	It wobbles in terms of an authentic feel, yet there's no doubt Fey succeeds in her most serious big-screen outing yet.

943	The film captures, as do the Hughes films it nakedly wants to be, something pleasantly casual about the rhythms of teenage life.
944	An impressive piece of work, a lesbian melodrama which is probing, thoughtful and finally very moving.
945	click for full review
946	Because nothing plays out as anticipated, this off-balance project comes fully alive on screen in a way a written summary can't capture.
947	Suffused with clever lines, characters with neurotic tics and a pervasive, jocular black humour, The Savages is more about craft than art, but the craft, especially in the writing and acting, is at a high level.
948	Cute kiddie entertainment from Eli Roth? The gates of hell have surely opened.
949	What America doesn't need is more of these live action animated movies.

954	If you don't think too much, there's a gleeful feel to the proceedings, exemplified by McConaughey's shaggy, over-the-top performance.
955	The likability of the animals is a good tonic for just how curmudgeonly and then saccharine Christopher is; Pooh saves the day and finally the film from itself.
956	Turing may finally be getting what he deserves as the straightforward and well-acted The Imitation Game, featuring a strong performance from Benedict Cumberbatch as Turing. 
957	Doesn't belong anywhere near the best animated picture race, but you can do a lot worse when looking for a family flick to pass the time.
958	Country Strong weak in the story department.
959	Underneath the film's tantalizing stratagems lies little more than mundane truths.
960	It's one of the year's cleverest films, and also one of the best.

964	There are too many leaden moments and odd shifts in tone to keep Lions from winning us over.

966	Evokes a palpable sense of disconnection, made all the more poignant by the incessant use of cell phones.
967	Cosmopolis may, like Packer's limo, be an elaborately conceived but essentially vacant vehicle -- yet it has a master at the wheel.

969	...it's an old-fashioned star vehicle, fashioned for the particular screen personas of Tom Hanks and Julia Roberts by Hanks himself, who directed the film and wrote the screenplay with Nia Vardalos. You may recall that he produced her breakthrough film...
970	American Dreamz isn't mean enough or funny enough.
971	Two great death sequences don't make a movie. Just awful acting and pacing ruin the fun this film could be.

977	This incredible film may be director Peter Jackson's masterpiece.
978	With a deliberate pace and some fine performances, this film makes the utterly preposterous seem almost believable. That is quite an achievement in itself. More than that, Eastwood has made this an enjoyable film, which is just as remarkable.

986	Inherently heartbreaking and miraculously pure, Glatzer and Westmoreland gift their leading lady with a blank canvas and she returns the favor by pouring her soul on to it.
987	An extremely entertaining, brilliantly acted, highly diverting film which - like all hustles - delivers less than it promises. Still, it's worth being taken for the ride.
988	For the most part though, the honesty of the performances keeps everything afloat when it could drift into easy sentimentality.
989	For all of the love and money lavished upon John Carter it ends up feeling a touch musty and overly familiar.
990	Nobody can deny the honesty or the outright sincerity this film has.
991	"Between the episodic scenes that have no punch, and the lethargic direction in which children could grow a shoe size in the yawning gaps from one line to the next, the best word for this tedious project may very well be ""Wimpy."
992	As Nim is heralded, befriended, sold, rescued, refuted, forgotten and more, his epic cautionary tale thoughtfully examines the inherent dangers of man trying to remake his fellow creatures in his own image.
993	It's a movie aimed at teenagers in all senses of the term but it creates such likeable, intelligent characters.
994	Plot and character development are pretty much irrelevant in the sunshiny fantasy world of this movie.
995	In a case where the most dangerous are kept dangerously close, here we have a rarity: a suspenseful, yet dramatic Western.
996	Creeps you out in high style, even if Nakata did it better.
997	An entertaining but frustrating film. There are some good performances, and some great music, but the movie is too jumbled and confused to reach the heights to which it aspires.
998	As a madcap comedy of existence, I Heart Huckabees is literally full of itself.
999	Without Angelina Jolie, this movie wouldn't even be worth renting as a dog-day Tuesday evening video flick..
1000	Call My By Your Name, written for the screen by James Ivory, harkens back to the glory days of his partnership with the late Ismail Merchant, when the Merchant Ivory brand was an art-house staple.
1001	With the first film pushing three hours, purists will be pleased. Less die-hard audiences will find a lot of meandering set-up - albeit visually gorgeous meandering setup.
1002	This may be the summer's only film not aimed at teenage boys, but it still feels unshaped and underdeveloped.
1003	A blasting,blood-splattered shoot-'em-up, it minimally utilizes the game's first-person, role-playing perspective - and there's no interactivity.
1004	Implausible, formulaic, too ponderous for young kids, not cool enough for teenagers and yet strangely hard to resist. File away under extremely guilty pleasure.
1005	Blessedly free of the usual biopic freight and sanctimony, the exuberant new film Talk to Me has a great subject and a great actor working in tandem.
1006	Resonates more deeply than any film this year.
1007	Most importantly, though, Selma reminds us where the violence started - with the insidious, everyday practice of denying African Americans their legal right to vote.
1008	Into the Wild didn't make me want to eke out a living in an abandoned bus, but it did make me yearn - just a little bit - for my younger, less cynical days
1009	It's not exactly a perfect marriage, but Hopkins and Mirren create a funny, exasperated chemistry.
1010	So relentlessly tasteful that it's a little distasteful. 
1011	It might be set in a strip club, but Atom Egoyan's tale of loneliness, lust and jealously simmers with sensual heat.
1012	I'm happy to report that Bond is back, and he's bad. And that's good.
1013	...probably the most effective of the bunch...
1014	"Infectious Samba and Bossa Nova rhythms permeate the beautifully filmed earthy Brazilian atmosphere of Carnival. ""Black Orpheus"" is an unforgettable classic of cinematic poetry, music, and myth."
1015	Some devices don't work as well as others, however Kasi Lemmons has made a film that lives and breathes, even if it at times it doesn't work
1016	Smartly written and beautifully played.
1017	Walker is supposed to be lured by the buried treasure, but the actor, wearing Brad Pitt's bristle cut, is like Pitt with his sexy appetite sucked out.
1018	A witty, action-packed story.
1019	Competently made but predictable.
1020	... a preachy parable stylized with a touch of John Woo bullet ballet.
1021	Citizen Kane is the biggest cinematic landmark since pictures first started moving.
1022	Most of Serenity is talk, and thankfully, it is pretty great.
1023	... a courageous and horrific glimpse through the ego and courage of the human spirit into the emptiness of even the kindest human being's heart.
1024	This Chinese-American production may make decent television for children on a rainy day, but there's not enough thrilling action or comedy for the big screen.
1025	Jean-Christophe Castelli's screenplay feels stilted and contrived, desperate to check off as many political points as possible, but without earning them dramatically.
1026	Seeing The Hobbit is like going to a timeshare presentation. First you have to sit through the boring stuff before you can take advantage of the spectacular benefits.
1027	For Fincher purists, The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo is lumpier in plot fluidity than his other, sleeker work, but his call sign is still very much present ...
1028	A truly wretched sex comedy, or should we say non-sex comedy.
1029	What her film lacks in novelty and momentum, it makes up for it in atmosphere. That, in the end, can be a more difficult thing to capture, and will serve her well as her career matures.
1030	There are some beautifully modulated performances from a vast cast of compelling characters.
1031	It troubles you, makes you think, and at times thrills.
1032	The prospect of a third installment of this derivative series is much scarier than anything that happens in the movie.
1033	As one would expect from Ridley Scott, Matchstick Men is a visually innovative exercise.
1034	"G.G. Allin ends up coming across as a random explosion of useless spectacle -- despite his unfocused rants against ""the system,"" he's a rebel showman first and a subversive second."
1035	A satisfying look at young unrequited love, bromances, independence and letting go.
1036	Taking Woodstock simply doesn't capture the spirit of a very spirited time.
1037	With too much emphasis on the stylishly shot fight and action sequences rather than the sci-fi or even human elements, the film is all flash and little substance, even when it pretends to be interested in the latter.
1038	A fluid and forceful indictment of a culture of neglect.
1039	What is incredible in The Incredibles is the computer imaging.
1040	While the emotions may be muted, there's still something appealingly heartfelt about the way these siblings find each other. One can't help but cheer them on.
1041	Outside Providence paints Dunphy's transformation in broadly comic strokes, but Corrente mines a rich emotional undercurrent through the performances.
1042	This would-be romantic comedy is neither. The premise is misbegotten, the chemistry non-existent and the dialogue leaden.
1043	So that's that. If you're under the age of twelve this movie is for you. If you're any older than that you might as well just stay at home.
1044	...attempts to evoke the essence of Cape Fear -- if Cape Fear had been written by a room full of monkeys.
1045	As written and directed by Peter Landesman, the movie is a straightforward nuts-and-bolts affair of no particular consequence. 
1046	Miyazaki's appreciation of miraculous possibilities and childhood visions is what drives Totoro.
1047	...features more smart, funny people than any other dumb, unfunny film I've ever seen.
1048	A fantastic manipulation, taking viewers to a tranquil place of immense culture and beauty while studying the enticing ease of nostalgia. And here's something I never thought I'd write again: Owen Wilson is marvelous here.
1049	The crockumentary crashes and burns in Paper Heart, built around comedian Charlyne Yi's purported search for true love.
1050	It's got the two Coreys...need I say more?
1051	Duvall and Caine have more fun with shotguns than anyone this side of Phil Gramm.
1052	Thank you, lord, for Russell Crowe.
1053	Kontroll calls itself a thriller, and you will agree if you are excited by scenes of bored inspectors arguing with sullen straphangers.
1054	The acting is brilliant as is the direction.
1055	Valkyrie is made with impeccable professionalism and, flying in the face of years of Internet hysteria, is a perfectly acceptable motion picture. The only thing that keeps it from even greater accomplishments may be inherent in the story itself.
1056	Leaves you completely without thrills, chills or even mild displeasure.
1057	Imagine a gonzo collaboration between Jean-Luc Godard, Michael Bay and Tex Avery on a weekend meth binge, and you begin to get an idea of what writer-directors Mark Neveldine and Brad Taylor have up their sleeves.
1058	A quirky, mostly endearing commentary on love in a postmodern age.
1059	Strange ensemble noir comedy chase flick.
1060	An unending heart -pounding; adrenalin pumping; sweaty palms inducing ride . It's what summer movies should be like. 
1061	"I didn't walk out of Monster with that ""great"" movie feeling, which is not to say it wasn't ""great."" Profound fits better."
1062	An inventive anti-hero theme sets this film apart from the usual superhero movie, but excessive violence and incoherent action leave it deeply frustrating to watch.
1063	Raunchy action comedy from South Park team isn't for kids.
1064	Lawrence shows the ways in which such deep and often barely concealed gulfs between seemingly peacefully cohabitating peoples can suddenly reveal themselves during moments of public crisis.
1065	Despite what the film's marketing says, it's not a horror film, and it doesn't function well as one. But it is a pretty darn good dark psychological thriller. 
1066	DuVernay's most remarkable accomplishment may be that with such passion-inspiring material, she has made such a measured, resolute and levelheaded film.
1067	The Wedding Banquet never becomes bogged down by its own seriousness. Lee manages to keep the production buoyant by including scenes that are often riotously funny.
1068	Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri will make you feel deeply, laugh loudly and think hard, often in the space of one scene. It is a triumph and sees writer and director Martin McDonagh at his absolute best.
1069	[McGregor] never does the richly-layered book justice, starting brightly but increasingly flailing as the narrative becomes overwrought when it should understate.
1070	It's ridiculous and knows it. It's the Dukes of Hazzard for the rave/glowstick generation.
1071	Su verdadero valor subyace en lo que un genio del cine como Romero tiene que decir respecto de hacia donde nos dirigimos como humanidad. Hoy todos somos zombies.
1072	Co-directors Glenn Ficarra and John Requa botch the juxtaposition of comic and dramatic elements in Whiskey Tango Foxtrot.
1073	As revenge films go, 'Max Payne' is a little less than average.
1074	Frances McDormand is in Fargo-like high form.
1075	This film embodies the easy pace of southern life and has the usual assortment of goofy, but lovable characters.
1076	There are lots of shots of Billy's anguished face, yet his budding PTSD and overall disillusionment are never developed. 
1077	Excellent.
1078	Substantial credit should also go to Terence Stamp's casually menacing General Zod, who transcends his terrible costume and make-up to appear a convincing threat.
1079	...a seriously absurd piece of work...
1080	An Oscar nomination would have been nice. Just see the movie. It will be more than enough to tell you all you need to know about Annette Bening.
1081	Superb as biography, as history, and as drama. It is one of the best movies of this year and this decade.
1082	Bicentennial Man is sometimes sweet, but it's also a phenomenal waste of talent, and a continuation of a Williams' trip down the wrong road.
1083	Expertly captures a feeling of woozy bewilderment.
1084	It's well-crafted, its air of menace is palpable, and Mr Cranston brings depth and detail to a tricky role.
1085	I don't think that there's anything in this film that really doesn't work.
1086	...wowing enough to silence rude, modern movie audiences in their seats.
1087	...a much more conflicted portrait of the late rap star than the documentary itself admits.
1088	Justifiably one of the most indelible adventure films in cinematic history...
1089	Rather disappointing in the end, but Shults delivers a few memorable scares.
1090	It has the good sense to hold up a mirror to ourselves, only instead of making us feel guilty and stupid, it makes us feel inclusive and in on the big joke.
1091	A trial to sit through: stiff, ponderous, fluttering in its 'poetry,' and crudely simplistic as an apologia for the Confederate ideology.
1092	The family-friendly film avoids pitfalls, but the DVD is skimpy.
1093	Something about Nick Park's characters is intrinsically hilarious... Maybe it's those teeth.
1094	It's a totally serviceable reboot for young people who are just discovering the joys of manga, but I can't help but miss the raw animation and even rawer emotional aesthetics of Tezuka's original televised anime series.
1095	Ridley Scott supplies bloodthirsty spectacle on an extraordinary scale in this muscular historical drama.
1096	With The Skin I Live In, Almodovar adopts a playfully wicked attitude, similar to the one James Whale used on Bride of Frankenstein. 
1097	The movie's grueling, inspiring, astonishing to look at. You come out feeling you've traveled half the planet. As ordeal movies go, though, this one's oddly easy to shake off.
1098	Shadow of the Vampire might be the most original film of the year.
1099	"It's disappointing, sort of like if Madonna had released her ""Sex"" book without the sex."
1100	Bad history. Bad science. Bad acting. Bad movie.
1101	Classic should be required for any movie lover.
1102	"American Hustle"" may have taken its inspiration from the art of the steal, but it has a heart of pure, if slightly tarnished, gold."
1103	...arguably the best non-Pixar [animated] film that Disney has released in some time... [A]t best, it's an amusing by-the-numbers effort.
1104	The personal relationships are pleasingly complex, characters you start off loathing you end up liking, and, of course, there's a terrific shootout in the end.
1105	can't decide how irreverent it wants to be, and settles for a neither-here-nor-there attitude that, luckily, scores with a few genuine laughs
1106	Its war-is-hell platitudes are as unconvincing as the Destiny's Child lookalikes its protagonists find themselves supporting.
1107	Not so much movie as antidote -- to the cynicism that's rampant in most Hollywood romantic comedies.
1108	A comedy of discomfort, The Savages is a brilliantly acted film about people who are kidding themselves, a state of being that is as funny as it is sad.
1109	It's an exciting, fast-paced, beautifully photographed and often enthralling race against time, as well as a riveting social commentary on sexism and sexuality.
1110	One of director Blake Edwards' best w/terrific Mancini score.
1111	"The ""Death Tape"" of The Ring is nearly as incomprehensible as Mulholland Drive. At least Naomi Watts eventually makes sense of this one."
1112	Close is magnetic, accepting an acting experiment with a thrilling fearlessness and devotion to complete immersion. If only the rest of the production matched her grace and concentration.
1113	Mysterious, breathtaking, wondrous, lyrical, captivating and profound. Patient and intellectual audiences will be rewarded the most.
1114	One of those great Westerns, equal to John Ford's top work, that has somehow been undeservedly ignored.
1115	The problem with Waist Deep is that it has too many small parts. Individually, the parts are fine. Once assembled, though, they don't add up to much.
1116	A quirky, multi-character collage that skillfully keeps you off balance, not knowing where it's headed.
1117	But even with the two-wrongs-make-a-right chemistry between Jolie and Burns...this otherwise appealing picture loses its soul to Screenwriting For Dummies conformity.
1118	A chick flick that feels thirty years behind the times.
1119	Sure to wow the critics, but no movie for the masses.
1120	Here's how you know Josh Brolin has become a movie star: Jonah Hex may not be much with him, but without him? Perish the thought.
1121	Whom do you root for when everyone is sleazy?
1122	A piece of perfectly realized, pure entertainment.
1123	Truffaut imbues the movie with the irrepressible energy and optimism of youth.
1124	It feels as if this party is over and it is time to call it a day.
1125	McDonagh lets the guilt flow freely and in unexpected places, not so much tearing our sympathies as folding them in on themselves until we realise that simple answers are unlikely in the presence of complex humans. 
1126	It wants laughs but isn't willing to do what it takes -- take off the gloves and land some blows to the body politic -- to earn them. 
1127	"With a combination of power and grace, Julianne Moore elevates ""Still Alice"" above its made-for-cable-television trappings, and delivers one of the more memorable performances of her career."
1128	Rock the Kasbah is a piece of head-scratching bad, ugly business. 
1129	Unlike the novel, which you can set aside and take a break, with the film version of Revolutionary Road, you're in for the duration, and it's ultimately too much to take.
1130	Selma is one of the great emotional experiences of recent years; a fiercely powerful look at one of the Civil Rights Movement's most triumphant victories.
1131	"I Origins"" has the genetic markers of a formulaic supernatural thriller, and it's marred by some muddy metaphysics and fuzzy science, but the beauty is in the details."
1132	Must Love Dogs, though, has some things a lot of today's romantic comedies don't have and need badly: smart dialogue, bright characters and a pair of lovers who don't look as if they belong at a college bash or in a gossip column.
1133	A slice of old-school Noir. Arquette makes for a terrific femme fatale.
1134	It may take some time to realise how special this gritty and unsentimental examination of family dynamics and Payne's home state is, but Nebraska is worth the patience.
1135	This is a charmless, lifeless affair that had me leaving the theater in a mood more appropriate to a funeral than a wedding.
1136	Astro Boy is a blast, a jolt of Japanese anime channeled through British slap-shtick that ends up yet another cool cartoon for both kids and adults.
1137	Kinda dumb and tacky, but at least it's a real movie.
1138	They might not all be the most pleasant people to spend time with in real life, but on screen, it would be hard to do better.
1139	Let's just say the scenery is incredible. Oh, and it was shot in the Bahamas, so the locations are pretty sweet too.
1140	Sofia Coppola has made the kind of movie that I love to see most.
1141	The skeletal story of The Rover is a case of too much bone, not enough meat. 
1142	Co-writer-director Todd Graff doesn't look at teens or their issues in a condescending light.
1143	Alive with the joy of filmmaking for its own sake.
1144	Watching Hopkins and Mirren transform into these characters is a must-see. While the movie is far from perfect, these two actors are perfect.
1145	There are some great sight gags and the script has some good lines, but there aren't enough of them - and the plot is rather slight and predictable.
1146	Wilson deserves better, too. He's too smart to make me believe he'd actually think this movie is funny.
1147	Stylishly directed, well-written and boasting an eclectic soundtrack, this is an enjoyable con flick with both Cage and Ridley Scott on top form.
1148	A mature, well-made film for teens and adults.
1149	The dancing is the star of any of these movies, and Sie knows when to get out of the way and let it do the heavy lifting.
1150	All of the best parts here go to women -- Sciorra, De Mornay and Julianne Moore in a funny supporting bit as Claire's cynical, suspicious friend.
1151	Tasty around the edges but disappointing in the center, Larry Crowne will meet the summer rom-com needs of many, but will not serve as a memorable addition to Hanks' legacy.
1152	This ode to the joy of chain smoking would make a great cigarette infomercial if tobacco companies were still allowed to show such things.
1153	This touching, finely wrought bowl of suds is a seamless piece of work.
1154	The film is gratefully short but writer/director David Twohy still takes too much time working through the standard suspect check list before getting to a terrific twist.
1155	I'd go so far as to say that if you really liked this film, you have a career working in fast food to look forward to. Get it? Fast food?
1156	While there has been some streamlining of the facts for the sake of storytelling efficiency, an outraged and righteous heart beats strongly throughout.
1157	The folksy shenanigans are well-intentioned but frankly interminable, with Kline's wry efficiency the best relief from all the yowling and whining.
1158	All this is every bit as silly and innocuous as its sounds, and it goes down, if not like honey, than like very finely spun cotton candy.
1159	A powerful story, one of the year's best films, told with great clarity and remarkable technical detail, and acted without pumped-up histrionics.
1160	Those that have been to France might enjoy the look of the food and the scenic landscapes but for those after a character-driven drama, Paris Can Wait comes up empty.
1161	Who'd of thought that a battle over water rights would make for such an interesting tale?
1162	There's nothing really new here: it's all sub-Home Alone nonsense.
1163	More in line with About Schmidt than Sideways, Alexander Payne's latest is a warm and witty look at the relationship between fathers and sons...
1164	A well put together exercise in the pleasures and pitfalls of nostalgia...
1165	It might be arguable whether it is the best Seagal film or not, but Nico still has all important Seagal trademarks.
1166	An uplifting and enriching cautionary tale about one man's spiritual adventure on the road and in the wilderness. 
1167	If nothing else, Disney's given audiences a live-action version of characters that isn't just a carbon-copy of something old dressed as something new.
1168	Brutal as it is, The Rover evolves into a strange kind of buddy movie. Squint and you might be watching a nihilistic Rain Man.
1169	Moorhouse's amazing ensemble have lots of nasty fun with their often awful characters, but it's her adapted script that makes this, her fifth film as director, so subversive.
1170	Welcome back, Steven.
1171	Unfortunately perpetuates the idea that the ultimate accoplishment is capturing the affection of a jerk.
1172	Watching it at home without the three-strip Cinerama process takes most of the sparkle out of the film.
1173	The film's near fatal flaw rests with the recasting of Hannibal as an admirable Nazi hunter capable of compassion, a person who bears little relation to the psychopathic misanthrope who so easily sent shivers running up and down an audience's spine.
1174	Of the many qualities I adore about Melissa McCarthy as a comedian and as a dramatic actor, the best is how fully she gives herself to every character she plays.
1175	The film is nutty, ecological, antically funny, and moving, all at the same time.
1176	Talk about your pointless remakes.
1177	The picture is actually watchable.
1178	A meandering mess that almost comes together at the end.
1179	"Selma"" demands to be seen now and by the generations that follow."
1180	As laugh-out-loud funny as it is jaw-droppingly offensive, this is hugely enjoyable comedy that actually has something to say.
1181	Contains a strong sense of how difficult/necessary it can be to watch and wait rather than act and arrest.
1182	Matchstick Men works because of the way the key players handle the material. This is the work of professionals acknowledging a good story and knowing better than to get in the way.
1183	Hard to imagine anyone else in the role of singer James Brown than actor Chadwick Boseman. He nails it. 
1184	"Murphy's Romance"" takes a whole movie to arrive at the conclusion that takes us two minutes, but that doesn't mean this is a predictable movie."
1185	A sobering, impartial look at the human condition.
1186	An intriguing feminist manifesto suggesting that trying to be more like a man might be a waste of a woman. 
1187	Tolkien's inventive, episodic tale of a modest homebody on a dangerous journey has been turned into an overscale and plodding spectacle.
1188	West's Lou must rank as one of the first truly liberated women ever seen onscreen...
1189	A muddled but often funny rap satire.
1190	"No Man's Land"" makes it's message go down with a laugh before it sucker punches you."
1191	Mr. Williams' performance is so grating that you may find yourself more infuriated than amused.
1192	This engaging French comedy has Fanny Ardant in Mrs Robinson mode as an improbably glamorous retired dentist who has an affair with a younger man.
1193	"With ""No Country for Old Men,"" the brothers Coen return to Texas -- and to form."
1194	The picture has no reason to exist, yet exist it does, thus between movies that might be good and movies that might be exciting, it fills this unenviable slot as neither.
1195	The Passion of the Christ is a rare thing indeed, then: a work of art that succeeds as a film, as a message, and, yes, as a labor of love.
1196	Besides not being a terribly good Bond entry, it's also a poorly made film.
1197	No one but the performers' family and friends will be coming to Reign of Fire for the acting. It's the dragons ... that carry the picture.
1198	It may be a little too Jack Webb for the masses, but there is value to its sober, just-the-facts approach.
1199	After seeing Cosmopolis, you're going to want to take a shower.
1200	Doesn't just play for laughs in its exploration of self-fulfilment, camaraderie and gender politics.
1201	Love, Simon is a leap forward for representation on the screen that is highly entertaining and surely to infuriate many of the most regressive voices within the religious right.
1202	Crossover is a movie that fouls out in the first half.
1203	While it's most certainly not light viewing, and it's entirely devoid of 'Hollywood moments', this is a fine, intelligent, troubling film.
1204	Some unpredictable twists, intense thematic moments, and strong performances, the movie does not provide quite enough to warrant a recommendation.
1205	It's trapped between being a tense political procedural and a sensual sex drama and it doesn't have the guts to be either.
1206	Until now, Veronica Mars has been that movie that got funded by that Internet site. Now, it's just a good mystery movie with snappy dialogue. That's an even nobler thing to be.
1207	Certainly cinematic junk food, but it's slickly fashioned and packaged.
1208	It's great on raising the level of tension, and its special effects and unique filming style are also great.
1209	The Tourist is memorable for one thing, at least. It's the first movie to make Venice look boring.
1210	So inane that not only is adult enjoyment unattainable, even younger audiences will be on to its lack of intelligence and novelty. 
1211	A goofy mess whose screws aren't loose, but missing entirely.
1212	It should work for either fans of quirky romcoms or Aubrey Plaza.
1213	Very stylish, nice to look at, but a good cast and good director, doesn't always mean it's a good movie. It doesn't draw you in and make you want to stay through the end.
1214	With Mother and Child, Garca brings his finely calibrated sense of drama to the subject of adoption, which he handles with characteristic restraint and insight -- at least until the film's maudlin, too-pat finale.
1215	Hoplessly bleak and disturbingly detached, this dissection of a doomed marriage is saved by Kate Winslet's formidable performance.
1216	A shocking, stunning, hyper-stylized interlude - designed to make you shudder.
1217	Channing Tatum, working with Soderbergh for the fourth time, is at his sympathetic and charismatic best in Logan Lucky.
1218	"...isn't as biting as ""Wag the Dog"" was, nor as prescient, but it throwsan issue into the ring as it entertains its audience."
1219	...a soon-to-be-forgotten movie that had a few very funny moments.
1220	Despite its many problems, I still enjoyed My Dog Skip, thanks almost completely to the considerable charm of Frankie Muniz and the various canines playing Skip.
1221	The cinematic equivalent of fingernails on a blackboard.
1222	Who are these half-wit Hollywood clowns that keep hiring cleavage-candy actresses with no measurable talent to play laughably bespectacled scientists in action movies?
1223	The only way to make The World's End any better would be to actually see it in a theater that serves beer. 
1224	You have got to be kidding me.
1225	the movie has only one sword fight, and it consists of only three or four swings of the blade, but don't let that dissuade you. You won't be bored.
1226	Russell has always had a talent for harmonizing tragedy and comedy, seriousness and outlandishness, all within a precise tone that allows for a wide range of emotions and effects. But his hand has never been more sure.
1227	Wicked fun and another feather in the cap of Kevin Smith.
1228	The plot's so rushed that it almost feels like it takes place within just an hour.
1229	There's lots of talk about kharma without mentioning the word, and a major theological debate on transmigration of souls, which surprisingly, isn't boring at all.
1230	This is an intellectual approach to an emotional issue - and it delivers, powerfully and beautifully.
1231	a sly and witty love letter to human perseverance, porcine resourcefulness, and the absolute conviction that English football was sent to us direct from heaven.
1232	Hazanavicius has reminded us of why we love the movies. He is sure to bring a smile to anyone who gambles on seeing this glorious throwback. 
1233	It's as though the Neighbors formula had been dreamed up by that toddler: gather together as much stuff as you can, throw it madly around the room, and see if it's funny.
1234	Smith has slicked up his follow-up vision of Slackerville USA, but the outcome is nowhere near as brash and original.
1235	Although this talky collection of black-and-white films from Jim Jarmusch ... has the potential to drive anyone into the lobby, it rewards those who are patient.
1236	"Director Curtis Hanson puts a new spin on the familiar ""triumph against the odds"" theme with this slick showcase for the talents of superstar rapper Eminem."
1237	A soulless and charmless film that desperately hopes we won't see the stitches that barely hold its disparate pieces together.
1238	The movie gives you the fun and fright of a roller coaster, which is nice, since you may not be riding those anymore after watching this.
1239	Valkyrie is another entry into Cruise's canon of quality films and performances.
1240	Chances are you've seen seen this all before. But at least this time, you're seeing it with Pooh.
1241	I haven't the first clue, and I'm pretty sure neither do the filmmakers because, if they did, you'd think they'd have realized early on the meat and bones of their adventure were made out of nothing but burning ashes.
1242	January is the month when the studios like to dump their dogs, and this film is a real mutt.
1243	The land of the midnight sun has never looked darker.
1244	A tougher endurance test than anything NASA could cook up.
1245	This isn't as over-the-top as, say, The Wicker Man. But it is an engaging cop caper complete with Cage craziness, and that's enough.
1246	Another exercise in alienated chic, Stay plays like an impenetrable collage. The movie's chilly moods and eerie suggestions don't amount to much, and all the weirdness leads to a pip-squeak of a payoff.
1247	Even hard-core fans will learn something.
1248	Yet another comedy about a man-child who won't grow up, You, Me and Dupree has the faintly stale smell of food left overnight on the counter.
1249	this tripe is thinly plotted and moves at a snail's pace...[yet] as mind-numbing as the film is, it does manage to raise a chief question, which is: how many more of these dystopian teen action flicks are we supposed to sit through?
1250	A genuine charmer with appealingly natural performances and the kind of holiday warmth that can't be manufactured.
1251	Sequences are gorgeously filmed by cinematographer Eric Gautier, and they're heady with the joy of discovery -- they make you want to hit the road into the magnificent landscape we forget is out there.
1252	Conveys, in a good-humoured, sharply observed way, the small, painful cruelties and unpredictable rules of early adolescence, and it celebrates awkwardness without feeling the need to convert it into cheap triumph.
1253	Director Halstrom has a nice touch in working with the youngster.
1254	Frustratingly bland work from lead Robert Pattinson results in an awfully watery stew.
1255	This astonishingly bad tearjerker, a Fannie Hurst weepie with a gay twist, is as phony as a three-dollar bill and just about as entertaining.
1256	Sadly, the PVC-clad Nyah is a crashing bore.
1257	Visually stunning and moving religious documentary that gives the outsider a rare eyewitness report on the four-year search for the rebirth of a Tibetan lama in Nepal.
1258	Haynes looks back on mid-century conformity without camp or condescension. Carol's extravagantly beautiful surfaces are both seductive and dangerous, reminding us that nostalgia for this so-called simpler time papers over some stark injustices.
1259	Unlike most American dark comedies there is no soft edge to be found anywhere in this devastating indictment of war.
1260	This is the perverted delirious Bad Lieutenant to see.
1261	Much like an ice cream cone, this one is fairly fun while it lasts and entirely forgettable after the fact.
1262	A backwards detective story with Kane's lost childhood as an elusive puzzle piece in a lifetime of megalomania.
1263	"It amazes me that the production team that produced the fine ""Gettysburg"" are the same ones involved with ""Gods and Generals."
1264	"Even bigger, brasher, brighter and more vicious than the decade it satirises, though sadly ""Heathers"" failed to make Very happen. It's a blunt satire, though still effective, still coruscatingly funny - and scarily prescient."
1265	Let's just say it's all amazing. No Country for Old Men is exactly the kind of challenge film buffs will love if you're sick of the by the numbers, multiplex drivel.
1266	The movie is terrific on nuts-and-bolts stuff, but nuts and bolts aren't the same as drama.
1267	An artlessly powerful performance by newcomer Nicole Behaire anchors American Violet, an instructive, sturdily built drama based on a true story worth teaching.
1268	Vaults heedlessly between bedraggled comedy and serious-stakes scenes in which the director shuts off the fun.
1269	The film merits a second and third viewing for fans of Easter egg hunts. [Full review in Spanish]
1270	Its span may be global, but its scope is modest, and it accepts a certain superficiality as the price of useful insight.
1271	If The Fighter, was Russell's take on a sports movie, then Silver Linings Playbook is his version of a romantic comedy, and a delightfully twisted one at that.
1272	An ordinary drama embellished and in some sense infringed on by genre elements rather than the other way around.
1273	Remarkably unremarkable; a lively war of the worlds diversion with plenty of spunky special effects, gratuitous slapstick, and Ashley Tisdale parading around in a bikini for all the dads out there.
1274	With its foot pressed to the floor from beginning to end, Bourne is a non-stop gas.
1275	It's a comedy that's not really much of a comedy, and it forces the audience to sympathize with a monster of a woman, even while she shows no remorse for her awful crimes.
1276	The film works well despite its predictability, perhaps because of it.
1277	that 'jolly hockey sticks' vibe feels outmoded with the only efforts to update the concept being shorter skirts and push-up bras.
1278	A fairly hilarious inside-Hollywood farce.
1279	It's very satisfying when a movie manages to generate some discussion, and makes one want to know more about its source of inspiration. [Full review in Spanish]
1280	It isn't great by any stretch, but it could be just the escape for anyone hoping to avoid the big-budget blockbusters currently using up all the available oxygen.
1281	Roll Bounce glides along easily enough, hitting the occasional bump that stems from a script that can't figure out how to blend comedy and drama.
1282	It is safe to say that few heard about this incident and wondered what kind of gelato these guys prefer, or what they talk about when connecting on Skype.
1283	so impressive in so many ways that it makes the frustration over its miserable final moments that much harder to bear
1284	After travelling to Hawaii with George Clooney for The Descendants, Payne returns to middle America for this gentle, enjoyable exploration of family connections. 
1285	One of those movies like Ghost World and Legally Blonde where the description can't do justice to the experience.
1286	From time to time, a gem-like line shines from the squalor, but in general, it's merely the film's suffocating cynicism that registers.
1287	Improbably, the film vaults over most pitfalls of long-threatened sequels while evolving the delicately crafted world in the original. It's a more sober, mature film, but no less entertaining or provocative.
1288	Hilariously inept, absent even a drop of everyday logic, and mistakes rowdy thespian reaction for suspense...can't seem to make any sense of itself, to a point where the whole endeavor just gives up.
1289	I, Robot is fun, even when it relies a bit too much on standard police-procedure cliches.
1290	Hughes appears to love these characters, but he's serving a platter of rancid gags, losing interest as the story lurches from one roadside encounter to the next.
1291	Missteps prevent ballet drama from reaching great heights.
1292	Visually compelling and with a cast willing to make the effort so that we'll take it seriously, this is a solid action film.
1293	The material knows it is a prequel, and acknowledges such with tactics that consist of taking viewers from beginning to end in the most straightforward way possible...
1294	There are too many gags that fall flat and the strain of an all-marionette cast shows all too often.
1295	Bale's cool, clinically detached freak show is fun to watch, and disturbing too.
1296	It took guts. And I suspect there's no sense in making a cautious film about Nathaniel Ayers.
1297	Fortunately, the movie turns out to have more of a story than I would have expected, given the looseness of the TV show, and the plot provides structure and focus.
1298	While director Fincher has accomplished any number of technical marvels in the film, Benjamin Button lacks a soul.
1299	Campy fun if you're ready for it
1300	Stunning study of human nature squeezed.
1301	Basically a picaresque rom-com about a girl who needs to feel OK about having everything she could ever want.
1302	Doom ain't Shakespeare. But it's not bad.
1303	"Del Toro just goes for effect, and the effect he seems to be going for here is something like, ""Ew, Guillermo, that's really gross."
1304	As with the best comedies, the film mines its laughs from recognizable human traits. Its premise might sound like something some folks might dread, but as a movie, it's everything you could wish for.
1305	A bracing and completely absorbing thriller.
1306	I prefer my Martin Lawrence humiliated, emasculated, and speechless...a slightly ludicrous, slightly bloated, but overwhelmingly good-natured comedy of the broadest kind.
1307	Thanks to a combination of real locations and convincing computer-generated effects, Scott can create sweeping vistas and that Cecil B. DeMille would envy.
1308	Based on the popular Japanese animated TV series, it features many of the strengths and weaknesses of the genre.
1309	This movie combines an original and realistic premise, a quick pace, many gruesome and creative death scenes and a pretty cool ending.
1310	Director McGuigan and screenwriter Matt Greenhalgh paint Film Stars Don't Die ... in unapologetically sentimental tones.
1311	Jackson is The Man, and he bestrides this film with the authority of someone who knows the value of honest bilge. He's as much the auteur of this baby as the director and screenwriters, and that fierce glimmer in his eye is partly joy.
1312	There's no swifter way to ruin 'not bad' than a reminder of something truly great... and for I, Robot, that reminder is never further away than the title.
1313	The comedy works thanks to Vardalos' plucky humor and a genial cast.
1314	Robertson, making her directorial debut with this American production, manipulates her images in a manner that distorts the truth and brings into question what a documentary film is supposed to do.
1315	The first words in the dazzling The Prestige are, 'Are you watching closely?' You'd better be.
1316	What saves Film Stars from the emotional murk is the passing sense of time. McGuigan captures the layers of sediment as they fall to the bottom... The result is something like a sand jar: a million moments miraculously sifted into an unnatural pattern. 
1317	A satire too broad and cartoonish to be taken seriously.
1318	While restrained and internal throughout most of the film, Penn displays both chilling intensity and heart-wrenching grief when it really counts.
1319	Hide your welcome mat.
1320	Cook and Alba generate about as much chemistry as a mongoose paired with a rattlesnake.
1321	[The actors give] with warm performances from everyone involved, especially Farrell as a dangerous, but boisterous misfit.
1322	Lesson of kindness permeates inspiring true story.
1323	"I wish ""Matchstick Men"" kept me in the dark longer than it does leading to the climax. It is a real pleasure, though, to see Cage in thesping form again."
1324	Enchanted is, indeed, enchanting.
1325	James, who co-wrote, endows the title character with such piercing sweetness that even his geeky pretensions are endearing.
1326	"Despite a lack of complexity, ""Skyfall"" is a respectable chapter in the Bond saga."
1327	Constantly, almost pathologically, making excuses and rationalizations for the brutal murderess.
1328	But it finds time for the message that the bonds of friendship we hold in our hearts far outweigh the little red hearts we collect from strangers.
1329	It ... feels like the director is trying to reverse-engineer one of the Coen brothers' loopier excursions and not getting every one of the pieces in order. But he comes close.
1330	Since The Pursuit of Happyness, actor-producer Smith has made no secret of his desire to make movies that entertain in that big-studio way but also dig deeper. Hancock is a rousing measure of that intent.
1331	Shows you don't need much more than a good script to make a decent film - even if said script involves time travel.
1332	While Larry Clark sensationalizes the plight of children, British neo-realist Ken Loach merely presents. His portraits of the working class don't condescend to the struggles and determinations of working class life.
1333	"The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey"" is not the worst film of the year, but it may be the most disappointing."
1334	The Angry Birds Movie is exactly what one expects from a movie based on a video gaming app, and so much less.
1335	Russell is unable to transform his psychologically warped story into a shape that can be enjoyed.
1336	Very quickly it becomes clear that the life of Nim Chimpsky is foremost a story about the human animal, and human behavior.
1337	The result is no classic, but it is fun and it seems to be paving the way for the day when, under the guidance of a smart director, McCarthy knocks one out of the park.
1338	This movie literally just sits there going from scene to scene with a lackadaisical whimsy that, after a while, becomes a bit tedious.
1339	The rhythm is slow but the film is never boring, this is a story worthy of seeing in the big screen. [Full review in Spanish]
1340	While it's hardly Romero's scariest achievement, it is a thrilling, disturbing commentary on a man-eat-man world that hits just close enough to home to give viewers an uncomfortable pause.
1341	It plays like a young filmmaker trying to approximate a stereotypical Shane Black movie. 
1342	The wordplay of the title here is the only slightly clever element of this extremely lame comedy.
1343	One of the finest-written surprises of the year.
1344	Boneheaded throwaway.
1345	Kevin James throws his weight around as the dedicated mall cop, but sometimes his actions are more silly than funny.
1346	[An] unprecedented film that is not just a grand feature-length cartoon but a grand feature.
1347	The film sags from the weight of too many characters, and its suggestion that the world is nothing but sadness is too much to bear.
1348	After working with each other for many years, this should have been a tight film. But it's lazy, tired and painfully laugh free. 
1349	Largely, it's a jellybean of a movie: bright, colorful, sugary, and with no real content.
1350	Toni Collette gives an incredible performance - plus, there's a great use of Abba music.
1351	How do you get from Jiro Dreams of Sushi to Jiro Dreams of Reanimated Sushi?
1352	Unfortunately, this family comedy doesn't live up to its promising premise.
1353	A science fiction movie for adults.
1354	"The performances and luscious cinematography are highlights of ""The Light Between Oceans""; it didn't overwhelm me with feels but certainly is a worthy entrance into what is hopefully a satisfying award season."
1355	A fast-paced, glitzy but extremely silly piece.
1356	Hobbled by weak argumentation, a character who winds up a complete muddle, and Sayles's inclination to romanticize Latin American revolutionary types, Casa is as mixed an effort as the filmmaker has essayed in some time.
1357	Altman is still at the top of his brilliant abilities.
1358	It's a half-step backward for Cholodenko, whose latest film has none of the tenderness or fresh insight about relationships and sexual ambiguity of High Art.
1359	At its relaxed best, when it's about, well, nothing, the slyly comic Bee Movie is truly beguiling.
1360	...dourly delightful.
1361	This production seems fully realized unlike other recent effects films, like Men in Black II, that appear sloppy and rushed. The best dragon movie ever made.
1362	An irresistible blend of screwball comedy and Disney fairy-tale musical, Enchanted takes its enchanting premise and prances away with it, holding the audience happily captive.
1363	The Soloist isn't the cringe-worthy Rain Man rip-off it might have been, but that's the only surprise this film has to offer. If it were a piece of music, it would be the kind you hear in a lift when you're stuck between floors...
1364	An accomplished and compelling film by writer/director Josh Mond, James White is also pretty much a bummer.
1365	A mosaic-style thriller whose artful recipe is deepened in The Sweet Hereafter.
1366	Why has it taken so long for Hollywood to tell this fascinating and deeply tragic story
1367	Forget Will Smith and Eva Mendes. You'll hope for a hook-up on future films between Smith and the very funny Kevin James. Their chemistry saves an otherwise mediocre movie.
1368	This film is everything a good film should be.
1369	The perfect family film for the festive season.
1370	The young men do quite well, and Eastwood delivers a polished product with a tightly staged climax.
1371	Enjoyable fun even if it's not particularly original.
1372	Despite a few threadbare patches, How to Make an American Quilt hangs together nicely.
1373	The movie is fun, but thinking about it afterwards reveals just how sloppy it is
1374	Its greatest achievement, no question, is simply that it rescues a period of modern history from its suffocating blanket of respect and worship.
1375	This is truly a movie that nobody needs -- gratuitously savage, implausible and sometimes incoherent.
1376	Warmly quirky, thought-provoking and silly, Nurse Betty won't provoke you to abandon your daydreams, but it might inspire you to look a little askance at them.
1377	Comes across pretty much as a pretentious soap opera -- a movie that wants the audience to believe it has more to say about life than the usual melodrama.
1378	Crimson Peak is worth a significant deal of admiration, even if that is primarily on its technical merits.
1379	It's a bland, stilted, stuffy costume drama masquerading as a chick flick.
1380	It's deja vu all over again
1381	... [I]f you like your horror thoughtful and provoking, this is your movie.
1382	A movie about people sitting around the desert with nothing to do runs a high risk of being dull, but Phoenix has enough wit, energy and charisma to keep soaring.
1383	You can tell they like each other as movie-star-buddies, they're relaxed, unshowy and inviting, but there's not one moment where you get the idea that naked sex activities are on anyone's agenda.
1384	Occasionally inventive but too willing to laze about in its own determined strangeness.
1385	The most satisfying non-Pixar animated movie to emerge in some time.
1386	A good enough Western to cause many to kick up their spurs in celebration.
1387	The Infiltrator is a perfect example of a movie where the performances are stronger than the story itself.
1388	"If you enjoy a bit of gore, creepiness and ghouls, along with a rather unusual love story, then check out ""Crimson Peak."" You'll never see red in the same way again."
1389	A lightweight but most enjoyable comedy-mystery.
1390	A misbegotten jumble that clumsily synthesizes various incongruous elements.
1391	Saint Laurent was a truly mythic figure. It's a shame that Bonello's film doesn't do him justice.
1392	The tone, despite the frequent bloodletting, is light, and the film works better than the script would indicate.
1393	Mulroney, best known as the title character in Roberts' comedy My Best Friend's Wedding, is by far the best thing about this gaggingly unromantic comedy. His character's bio, divulged in a thumbnail, is the least convincing thing.
1394	There's no crescendo in Joe Wright's drama.
1395	A movie populated entirely by stupid people doing stupid things, yet it somehow escapes being anything more than mildly irritating.
1396	Ultimately, Shadow of the Vampire is more a gift for film buffs than casual moviegoers.
1397	More of the same. It all depends on your taste for carnage.
1398	A drowsy comedy about a handful of kids grooving and roller-skating, Roll Bounce has heart and good vibes but little else to recommend it.
1399	A dishearteningly incomplete portrait.
1400	The first half is just not good, but it gives way in its second half to a movie that's very worth seeing to a degree that at least comes close to cancelling out the wonky first half.
1401	The film is poetically austere in dialogue but thoughtful. Like a walk on a spring day, Lost in Translation is not momentous but rather pleasantly freeing.
1402	Like its namesake festival it is crazy, naive, full of hope and features extensive drug use.
1403	Akin to an unhealthy relationship, this self-described 'anti-romantic comedy' begins hot and heavy before buckling beneath the weight of pointless conflicts and ridiculous game-playing.
1404	The key to the success of Marvel Comics adaptations is that even as the characters have fantastic powers, they remain ordinary people caught up in extraordinary circumstances.
1405	First-rate performances by Robert Duvall and Michael Caine.
1406	You could probably find similar suburban developments, and similar people living in them, in most if not all U.S. states and that jibes perfectly with the spirit of this film. 
1407	The female lead gives it fire power, but Jane Got a Gun is far from a crack shot.
1408	The comedic moments are too far-fetched and most characters come across as bumbling fools.
1409	Javier Bardem plays the part with all the pent-up animal rage of a young Robert De Niro
1410	"Bright Days Ahead"" offers an interesting twist on the May-December romance."
1411	People will argue over the film's histrionic tendencies but stars Kate Winslet and Leonardo DeCaprio bring it in every scene and produce an admittedly depressing film.
1412	What Schrader does best is show his characters inching forward through their flaws and transgressions.
1413	yet another harbinger that the total collapse of civilization as we know it has drawn just a little closer
1414	It has everything the TV series possessed, but also manages to elevate the tension to the next level.
1415	Mr. Sonnenfeld repeats some of the first film's favorite visual stunts without wearing out their welcome, and he sustains much more exuberance than a sequel might be expected to have.
1416	"There is a moment in ""The Tourist"" when Johnny Depp turns to Angelina Jolie and asks ""Why is all this happening?"" It's a question moviegoers will be asking themselves as well."
1417	Veronica Mars is a delicious and fulfilling outing for those who remember the series fondly, and even those who are non-fans should be able to follow along for most of the fun.
1418	Thirteen Oscar nominations? You have to wonder at the emotional maturity of the Academy Awards jury - perhaps they, as Pitt's Button, are ageing in reverse and are now sitting on their potties.
1419	Tepid small-town quirks and colorless 'colorful' characters dot this high-concept misfire.
1420	Eastwood has turned Lehane's novel into a quietly brilliant and deeply unsettling film that ranks up with Unforgiven as his best directing work.
1421	Might have been the best Bond if not for the bland Lazenby.
1422	It's pure entertainment -- nothing too serious, nothing too deep -- with an artistic sensibility.
1423	One of those magical and rare films with a nearly perfect mixture of beautiful writing, glorious music, elegant cinematography, remarkable acting, dazzling art direction, and an engrossing story.
1424	Funny and entertaining
1425	The small miracle of the movie isn't just that it tells a gay love story with such unreserved tenderness, but that it makes the fate of a romance not meant to last feel like much more than exquisitely framed filmmaking.
1426	Too occupied with shocking the audience with its over-the-top dialogue to notice that it's not working.
1427	The main audience for Good Luck Chuck wants to confront one of the central cultural questions of our time: Will Jessica Alba take her top off?
1428	"Reducing the iconic brute to a victim of childhood neglect and abuse? That's not, as The Beginning's tagline boasts, ""The Birth of Fear."" It's the death of it."
1429	Hanks's direction is unremarkable, and the bluesy soundtrack altogether more gritty than any of the action.
1430	The acting isn't that great, despite good performances from Ms. Johansson and Mr. Nam.
1431	The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey ... is clumsy where Tolkien's book is streamlined -- filling in the gaps where the novel is vague...
1432	New Line has nothing to fear, for Snakes on a Plane is a thrill, seeking, action-packed joy ride that will have you jumping in your seats.
1433	Effectively dark and entirely unpredictable.
1434	Black is not afraid to have some major fun with the premise.
1435	It's a scathing commentary on the effects of poverty, the failure to properly respond to refugee crises, and simple human decency populated by those struggling just as much as the next yet have also crossed a line they cannot return from. 
1436	Uneven movie about a charming cad has sexy stuff.
1437	"It's a movie of blandly pretty ""establishing shots,"" Seyfried walking her lovely self across this piazza or that vineyard."
1438	Imaginative, gorgeous, witty and even kind of sexy. 
1439	A mish-mash of disparate, non-cohesive ideas, the sort of film that thinks it's brilliant just because no one understands it.
1440	A pleasant romantic comedy.
1441	Skyfall acts as though every new James Bond adventure needs to earn our belief that he still matters, and that a secret agent with a soul can be just as compelling as an exploding pen.
1442	Joel and Ethan Coen have directed their best film since Fargo more than a decade ago.
1443	The best ensemble performance of the year and it's all true. Sort of. 
1444	There are few things sadder in life than an unfunny Bill Murray movie. But that's exactly what Rock the Kasbah is.
1445	Book a one-way flight on the original Phoenix instead.
1446	Must Love Dogs is an Internet dating comedy so weightless that it makes a trifle like You've Got Mail look like Chekhov.
1447	Entertaining if blatantly sexual and sado-masochistic, inducing thrills and chills.
1448	Flashy and funny, but extremely uneven, this superhero action comedy lets its gifted cast stroll through a series of ill-defined characters
1449	The film wonderfully captures the intensity of that first love -carnal, fleeting and unforgettable - that leaves an indelible mark on everyone lucky enough to experience it. [Full Review in Spanish]
1450	Jason Lee looks dumpy and disinterested throughout. That almost describes my feelings.
1451	Don't let pretentious film snobs scare you off from Wild Strawberries
1452	Daddy Day Camp, a comedy for no ages, has an amazing amount of CGI -- Cuba Gooding Incompetence.
1453	A thriller as tedious as 'Cold Creek Manor' benefits from a 'glass is half-full' philosophy: Each minute we spend in unspeakable boredom means we're one minute closer to the end.
1454	Nelson's brutally unsentimental approach ... sucks the humanity from the film, leaving behind an horrific but weirdly unemotional spectacle.
1455	The movie is disjointed and pointless. But its biggest shortcoming is that it's not funny.
1456	It's hard to muster up sympathy for characters too stupid to avoid getting sucked into the tragic fate of others and too self-involved to stand against injustice until they're inconvenienced by it.
1457	It's able to balance genuine insight with comic punctuation and shameless resolution; they get high and heartfelt.
1458	A halfheartedly Surreal comedy filled with forced high spirits, unconvincing lunacies and failed sight gags.
1459	Distinctly earthbound...neither bad enough to make you furious nor good enough to be memorable.
1460	Sad, desperate attempt at quirky action/comedy.
1461	After making Shopgirl, it appears Steve Martin had a lobotomy.
1462	While Guerra clearly owes a debt to Herzog and Coppola, he blazes his own trail. I can't wait to take this trip again.
1463	A film no one will remember, not even the people who star in it.
1464	... a movie that delights the eye even as it lulls the mind. And the heart. 
1465	The Cuckoo's Nest of sidekicks provide enough snappy patter to keep you giggling and take your mind off the excessive violence.
1466	The most aggravating kind of movie: the kind that shows so much potential, then becomes unbelievably disappointing.
1467	...an admittedly overlong yet thoroughly engaging effort that brings a fresh spin to the old fish-out-of-water formula.
1468	I don't know if DeLillo's fetishized doubletalk ever works in a visual medium like film, but I can tell you that Robert Pattinson sure as hell isn't up to it, at least not without better direction than this. 
1469	It may not be a great movie, but it's one of the most amusing times I've had at the multiplex this whole year.
1470	The movie's winsome artificiality may drive you bananas.
1471	a touchstone of Italian cinema
1472	While it's able to pull you in at some points with its eerie mood, it needed a lot more originality and better scares than the cheap kind of just having things pop up out of nowhere.
1473	Although the film contains many of the great verbal jokes that are Allen's forte, the visual wit and the sentimental drama fall a bit short.
1474	Though Wilson is considerably younger, blonder, more handsome and more Gentile than the Woody we know, he's somehow a natural in the role anyway. 
1475	It will... make you think twice about watching any of those video tapes with no labels on the bottom of your entertainment center.
1476	It's a throwback to an earlier era of filmmaking, in which the benefits of new technology are neatly disguised in old-school storytelling.
1477	It's Kramer vs. Kramer, without the Kramers, a 'true story' without much of the truth.
1478	This delightfully funny and smart family film certainly lives up to its title. 
1479	Very good biopic about the early days of the Beatles
1480	The script captures the zestful spirit of a young man confident of overcoming any obstacles in his path. The incessant banter between the adults is hit-and-miss, but the period production design by Jon Hutman is spot-on.
1481	it's easily the funniest movie of the year
1482	DePalma's overuse of his point of view shots, especially his out-of-focus sequences with his nearsighted damsel in distress, adds nothing to the proceedings.
1483	a curious and enjoyable dark comedy, black as night, with legit Oscar aspirations
1484	It's merely average. Director David R. Ellis and three credited writers have thought up a pretty cool situation but fail to do much more than deliver the requisite shock effects.
1485	It's a sprawling documentary that laments what's been lost in analog recording without ignoring the benefits of technology.
1486	The stories are eye-opening and heartwarming at the same time, but you'll be moved less by empathy for the characters than by the summoning of your own emotional memories. This movie is personal.
1487	It's an action thriller that races at breakneck speed and dazzles the audience, even if this program still has a few bugs to iron out.
1488	Okay, I'm sold. It's the worst sequel ever made. Yes, even including Batman and Robin.
1489	...a movie full of victims, with Wuornos as the most sympathetic of the bunch.
1490	One of the great espionage films, gleaming with suspense, atmosphere and sharp dialogue, and tautly directed by Alfred Hitchcock.
1491	One film was enough, two was plenty, but five is just absurd. Undoubtedly, there will be several people who will flock to this film just because it has cars zooming back and forth, so at least some people will be pleased with it.
1492	The subject of artistic creation is typically handled badly in the movies.... [Amadeus] treats the subject of creativity in a fresh way.
1493	... With its script problems, it's probably better than it should be ...
1494	Russell handles the shifts in tone extremely effectively, and has sacrificed little of his sardonic edge in crafting something this superficially accessible.
1495	There's a monotony to Gordon's performance that is not really his fault, though he's surrounded by an able cast of young performers who keep the movie's energy up.
1496	thoughtfully observes the human compulsion to connect via conversation in all its glorious absurdity
1497	Its sound-of-silence narrative speaks louder than words, and reveals the power of nuance and understatement.
1498	My first thought in watching The Hobbit was: Do we really need this movie? It was my last thought, too.
1499	The Bourne Identity is what summer screen escapism used to be in the decades when it was geared more to grownups.
1500	A low-key but devastating drama with more raw authenticity than a hundred examples of Sundance landfill.
1501	It's a charming, peaceful picture; a perfect diversion for those who like their corsets tight and confining and their romance kept behind a fence of social judgment and impossible odds.
1502	If Sean Penn isn't the finest actor working today, Mystic River sure makes it difficult to name an alternative.
1503	While this latest Rogen-penned iteration is a game try, it feels a bit like he's trying to make a volume out of a footnote.
1504	When it works, it shimmers, but when it doesn't, it yanks you out of the scene completely.
1505	Consistently sophomoric, periodically hilarious, and peppered with minor stoner insights.
1506	It's a gorgeous, self-assured, thrilling and entertainingly intimate epic, an actor's picture in front of and behind the camera.
1507	'Suggested by' Isaac Asimov's book of short stories, Alex Proyas's hectic thriller engages some interesting ideas on its way to an overblown and incoherent ending.
1508	Every composition, each image of her epic endeavor, especially in close-ups, comprise sensual, atmospheric marvels.
1509	The peak moment of Malick's career where he found the perfect blend of a respectful command of storytelling versus the more abstract submission to a cinema of the senses.
1510	It's not a relationship we become invested in, because all we see of it... are still photos over the opening credits.
1511	... limp and dreadfully dull.
1512	Nolan has nothing special up his sleeve in this hazy smoke-and-mirrors drama, especially in Jackman's climactic trick that's too sci-fi and fantastic to be believed.
1513	The last fifteen minutes are extremely stupid and almost ruin all that good stuff we've had before.
1514	Nebraska is an about-face for Payne, and, although it is an improvement over the indulgent Descendants, it does not resonate as resoundingly as his earlier work.
1515	In any case, if you judge Memoirs of a Geisha as a moving work of art, it's pretty fabulous.
1516	This entertaining narrative is probably a realistic view of what high-school life is like for privileged Californians.
1517	Knocked Up is an instant classic, and cements Apatow's status as the top comedic director in the business
1518	"Interviewees who issue hysterical statements like ""the sea ice cap is almost gone"" go uncontradicted."
1519	Grohl's aim is to explore the aura of a place, but what he winds up proving is that people make the magic.
1520	Jenniphr Goodman directs The Tao of Steve with a casual charm that beautifully conveys its offbeat textures and lovable characters.
1521	Scary horror flicks went out with the emergence of the self-referential horror movie.
1522	"Each scene introduces a new character with little explanation, all but abandoning the previous new face that was just presented. It's like that ""Too Many Cooks"" video minus the entertainment value."
1523	Motion picture archives and collections across the world would be poorer without copies of this film, which will forever be recognized as a defining example of American cinema.
1524	The supporting cast are all terrific, as are the Irish locations.
1525	Although the film is far from perfect, the cinematic landscape could certainly use a little more of this kind of thing and, with twelve novels to draw from, it wouldn't be difficult to make it into a franchise.
1526	The film's failure to adhere to one of the most important rules of humor -- never give extensive screen time to someone who is not the slightest bit funny -- prevents it from being a completely enjoyable, if silly, romp.
1527	Overrated, but still a good film.
1528	Smart ideas and political satire battle it out with relentless smut in a decidedly uneven affair.
1529	No resurrection for this dog please.
1530	Efficient and low-key, Thirteen Days takes itself just seriously enough while maintaining a powerful dramatic momentum.
1531	I hated, loved, hated the movie. In that order.
1532	...feels like a peculiar and singularly uninvolving documentary in which a series of bizarre events ... are re-enacted but without any point to the exercise.
1533	...a strikingly judgmental movie in favor of liberal lifestyles.
1534	Yes, it squanders its Sergio Leone-worthy source material, but it's a surprisingly entertaining disaster -- a sort of Concorde-New Horizons picture for the new millennium.
1535	Mara's efficient, straightforward physicality and her watchful but implacable expression are just right for the character who is about to kick the hornet's nest. 
1536	A film with more chuckles then guffaws, hopefully the producers will settle on better movies to make fun of next time around.
1537	This film about the doomed love affair of poet John Keats and his neighbor Fanny Brawne left me underwhelmed.
1538	Twohy serves up a hard-to-swallow second-act twist and an unconvincing back story, but the slightly overlong A Perfect Getaway recovers with a pulse-pounding climax.
1539	Cahill spends the entire film bringing a sense of wonder to the desperately rational Ian, and if the film takes on a glow toward the end, that glow feels well-earned.
1540	Though it's certainly a two-woman show, Carol finds room to be impossibly generous to very nearly every human being who appears onscreen.
1541	Part of the joke lies in seeing a megawatt star embrace his inner grouch with fantastical blunders, and part of the anticipation lies in seeing Hancock become, well, Will Smith.
1542	A tremendous character study, and a severe depiction of how guilt and the desire to punish oneself manifest.
1543	An uninvolving mo-cap adventure that's well below par. Marvin the Martian would be unhappy to share his planet with this bunch.
1544	A small-scaled picture that builds a striking degree of tension through very economical means, a cousin of Eli Roth's 'Cabin Fever' that depends on atmosphere rather than gore for its effect.
1545	Three Billboards plays like a country ballad that's full of improvised riffs on old themes: Its verses head off in different directions, some violent and swearing, others reflective or funny. 
1546	Call me a prude, but it's not sexy watching an erotic thriller in which every time a couple does it, one of them gets it with an ice pick. I don't care how many firmly toned tummies and tushes are bared.
1547	Where the original grounded itself within its conceit, Ralph Breaks the Internet's much broader one inevitably consumes it.
1548	Like a deep-fried Twinkie at the State Fair of Texas, ''Killer Joe'' is gooey, flavorful and bad for you. Dig in.
1549	"Too much of the time ""Hitchcock"" plays cute and comfortable. It simply lacks weight."
1550	Christophe Gans' convoluted, overlong adaptation of the video game Silent Hill is the worst kind of horror movie: trash that takes itself seriously.
1551	The charm of this film is not the heist, which is ridiculously complicated and improbable, but in its combination of quirky, often very funny, characters and the entirely earnest way the actors play these characters.
1552	Osment's the weak link in the movie and because of the substantial amount of time he spends on screen, his weak link status is highly noticeable and very distracting.
1553	Mr. Rodriguez demonstrates his talents more clearly than ever -- he's visually inventive, quick-witted and a fabulous editor -- while still hampering himself with sophomoric material.
1554	Director Sam Weisman knows the formulas and so do Spade and Wolf -- perhaps too well.
1555	So ridiculous was Hereafter that I laughed out loud several times at the ill thought-out, quasi-spiritualist philosophy it vomited from the screen.
1556	As sluggish, or perhaps concentrated is the more accurate description, Man is, it does stick its landing, paying off semi-stasis with shocking dramatic accuracy.
1557	My Big Fat Greek Wedding is not only the best date movie of the year, it's also a -- dare I say it twice -- delightfully charming -- and totally American, I might add -- slice of comedic bliss.
1558	...isn't among Crowe's best work, but it's a solid charmer that doesn't rely on Hollywood flash, gimmick, or poop jokes.
1559	The contrast between this grisly reality and the way it's framed as jingoistic spectacle makes a satiric point that's a bit too obvious to be effective.
1560	Emotional, violent, extreme and very gory, Mel Gibson's controversial The Passion of the Christ is a difficult and grotesque experience for most viewers.
1561	True, Alpha Dog is a film with no manners. But it has great nerve. What's truly impressive is how the splintered story is buried by individual performances.
1562	Whimsical, solipsistic and self-indulgent, Paper Heart represents everything that is wrong with American independent cinema.
1563	Extremely well-acted and not without its effective interludes, Mendes' latest effort is done in by a final ten minutes that lessen the story's would-be impact with an overload of tacked-on contrivance.
1564	One thing you can count on from Clint, it's making a movie that seems a lot longer than it really is. I'm not sure that's a great quality to have when it comes to filmmaking.
1565	While the film is slow, it is not uninvolving. In fact, the way Coppola directs, it has a compelling feeling of potential tragedy...off of this, Gia looks like a real comer as a director.
1566	Tim Blake Nelson takes a charged, unimaginable situation and stylistically flattens it
1567	Sam Mendes has worked in this territory before with his Oscar-winning American Beauty. Revolutionary Road is a better movie because it doesn't rely on such blatant caricatures.
1568	Heartache, teen angst and mordant comedy are well tuned. Very funny, with wonderful performances, it's an unexpected delight. 
1569	Though some of the concepts may be New Age boilerplate, the film's images linger; especially that of the river, the snake devouring us all.
1570	While The Edge Of Seventeen does deliver as a fresh, sharp and very funny comedy, there is also a serious side to its storytelling that gives the film a weight and a wisdom that so many entries in the genre never achieve.
1571	Filled with beautiful black and white photography, especially for its era, Red River is an atmospheric ride a la Unforgiven.
1572	It's the work of intelligent filmmakers with a welcome willingness to shoot for the big questions of life, the universe and everything.
1573	With all the high-profile movies blasting into theaters at this time of year, Lake City will probably get lost in the shuffle. That won't be a tragedy.
1574	Whether a paternal benediction is what Elio can or wants to hear, Call Me By Your Name is right to speak it. Philosophically as well as visually, this movie is a beaut.
1575	I wouldn't entirely dismiss it, but I would be reluctant to say I found too much about it that warmed my heart and appeased my soul.
1576	The crude-dude genre staples are mechanically rendered: gay panic in a biker bar, mescaline-fueled dreams, highway chases, and cancer.
1577	The purpose of the exercise. If you can't love this film, you have no business loving movies at all.
1578	Lovely to see Friedkin on such mischievous form and McConaughey finally revealing his dark side.
1579	With its personal feel, its more-than-capable cast and its rousing courtroom finale, it's the sort of picture that makes 'old-fashioned' a good thing.
1580	The strength of this movie is that it never flinches in showing us why [Tupac] made the choices he felt he had to make -- even though they ended up costing him his life.
1581	It leaves no unpleasant aftertaste. If you take impressionable kids, you should be prepared to explain two things: No, bees and humans do not normally live happily ever after; and yes, bees sometimes just sting you for the hell of it.
1582	It's at least trying to stay anchored in the real world, where cute couples don't always make up and walk hand-in-hand into the sunset.
1583	"If it's a Funny or Die movie, where's the ""die"" button?"
1584	Unfunny, unoriginal and tedious - Mall Cop is successful only at living up to the standard set by past films that have begun with the words 'A Happy Madison Production'.
1585	A lazy little product of mediocrity that will be woefully outdated in the next year...
1586	"Sausage Party"" is smarter than it looks at the same time as it is overly taken with its juvenile humor."
1587	"Words like ""dream,"" ""hope"" and ""believe"" resonate throughout All In, and while it seems cynical to discount them, it feels even more opportunistic to pretend they're real."
1588	a cut above your average fantasy world espionage thriller.
1589	Yi is a unique tour guide, her deadpan demeanour, embarrassed giggle and horn-rimmed specs generating non-starry appeal.
1590	One of those bad movies that will take its stars two good movies to recover from.
1591	The ending packs an emotional wallop, a moment as magical as anything you will see at the movies this year.
1592	This blade is much too dull.
1593	Romero has made a movie that will completely satisfy the Fangoria magazine crowd but, like his previous efforts, also manages to make acute observations about modern society.
1594	A good alternate to the death penalty, watching this movie over and over and over. That, my friends, is what is called a fate worse than death.
1595	High-Toned, Tragic, Exalted Soap
1596	a thrilling movie with great twists and turns, fantastic acting and an intensity that can only be matched in theaters by The Departed.
1597	Misguided, frighteningly comatose tale of love and neuroses; a maze of bad ideas that Brooks robotically assembles. He's surviving this picture, not directing it.
1598	It is fun, but empty fun.
1599	Yasujiro Ozu was a master film-maker who specialised in middle-class family melodramas known in Japanese as shomin-geki, and this moving story is one of his finest achievements.
1600	Funny, Mysterious, Wizardry
1601	Director Rob Bowman makes an all-out action film, without letting it enter the cheesy comic realm usually associated with the genre.
1602	Narratively, thematically, this is a dismissible picture, just another in a long and forgettable line of silly action flicks.
1603	An adult drama rich in emotional textures.
1604	The film is good, at times grizzly, fun -- of epic proportions.
1605	As an off-beat anatomy of a troubled couple, the film almost succeeds. As summer movie fun well, it's not.
1606	"Movies with a voice as strong, strange, smart and yes, sincere as ""Safety Not Guaranteed"" deserve to be heard."
1607	Actor Martin Lawrence brings a lot of energy to a movie ... to every miserable, worthless movie in which he stars.
1608	The live-action animal drama Arctic Tale arrives in an impressive visual package and even boasts a timely message, but its undistinguished storytelling is a big letdown.
1609	Only half a good movie -- the whole of it becomes confusing, disappointing, and non-sensical.
1610	"Without Helen Mirren, James D'Arcy and a few interesting scenes, this flat, lifeless exploration of Alfred Hitchcock's making of ""Psycho"" lacks depth or a suitable anchor."
1611	Best Picture? Wow. They had cynics back then, didn't they?
1612	There are worse ways to kill time, sure; it's just that there is, alas, so much time to kill.
1613	An excellent freakout of a movie.
1614	Part of me thinks young children will still be entertained by this mess, but anyone over the age of eight will probably start to squirm in their seat in boredom fairly quickly.
1615	"Debra Granik's independent drama ""Down to the Bone"" builds with a strong, quiet intensity."
1616	If Feig is working below his usual cleverness level here, at least he and the kids seem to be having fun doing it.
1617	"The biggest problem with ""Wrong Turn"" is that it fails to build its own mythology"
1618	Wright is one of the most original and energetic filmmakers out there, and paired with Pegg and Frost's expert rapport and a highly charismatic cast, there is no limit to what the team can tackle.
1619	While this is sure to amuse die-hard Smith fans, anyone else may either be hopelessly lost by the in-jokes or frustrated by the lack of screen time afforded the expansive supporting cast.
1620	a hilariously complex stoner noir that weaves around its massive web of characters utilizing a tone that's at times overtly slapstick, yet also deeply spiritual and romantic.
1621	Blistering, hallucinatory, often brilliant, the film by David Fincher is a combination punch of social satire and sociopathology.
1622	Hollow and pointless - a better title would have been 'Incoherent Vice.'
1623	I thought this was okay. I'm very embarrassed by that.
1624	There's a lot of material to get through and pacing becomes a real problem, the story flashing forward one minute and then becoming ponderous and meandering the next.
1625	The Darkest Minds looks like a pilot for a series. [Full Review in Spanish] 
1626	The Green Hornet's only victory is that it isn't flat awful.
1627	Teller is impressively bulked up, but there's a flatness in his performance. It's a dogged, rather than an inspired, portrayal.
1628	A splendid film achievement, a brutally funny collection of fragments from broken lives crafted by a director with renewed vitality.
1629	Foster's character in Flightplan is incredibly one-note, and it really wears on you after a bit.
1630	Aardman Animations has always been in the Bronze Age, but with Early Man, they're backtracking into the Stone Age.
1631	So in-depth, so appealing, so easy to sit through and so anomalously grand scale that few who see it will ever forget it.
1632	Trey Parker and Matt Stone do what they do best - provide the character voices, poke fun at everything, and write semi-genius songs to place between the off-color humor.
1633	Lackluster.
1634	Through the lens of science, Cahill and Marling explore the idea that something unexplainable and greater than all of us is out there.
1635	When a film has as much going for it as Good Luck Chuck did at the onset, and the magic is flying, it is positively heartbreaking to watch it all deteriorate by way of such glaring condescension.
1636	Completely enthralling from first frame to last, Cobb is a fascinating, uncompromising portrait of a rage-filled, contradictory man fighting his own private war with the world.
1637	At a time when politicians are most in question, [director] Levinson feels no qualms about depicting the process as a hilarious and yet dangerous farce.
1638	Wild Wild West is sadly a big disappointment considering the great team behind it.
1639	The anti-Slumdog Millionaire: a film that's stately, tasteful and genteelly melancholic rather than fevered, rollicking and euphoric. It's a film about time that seems almost out of time.
1640	If ever a film was in need of an order of Levitra, it was Welcome To Mooseport, ranking amongst the limpest political satires I've ever seen
1641	It's a real pleasure to watch these two old lions circle each other onscreen.
1642	"Bolt? More like Sparky. The movie is nowhere near as good as this year's best animated film, ""Wall-E,"" but it does zip with energy, the story escalates nicely and, in the end, it's a good time."
1643	Seeing an animated film in a theatre full of children and never hear them laughing is an indicator that something's wrong. [Full review in Spanish]
1644	If Jesus actually received the amount of punishment dished out in this film, he would have been dead three times over before arriving at Calvary. 
1645	... if you love these books, then consider this a Christmas present.
1646	Boyle's direction is still fast paced and throbbing with energy and pounding music tracks, but the tone is bleaker than the original, more poignant, more layered. 
1647	There is an uneven mix of slapstick sequences and human comedy. Certainly the last part of the film feels awkwardly written.
1648	Most Bond films have flaws but few Bond films end up as enjoyable as this.
1649	The picture has a light, winsome appeal.
1650	A mild family film with an excellent cast that never develops traction.
1651	The screenplay is attributed to three writers. That means if the film's funny parts were divided evenly among them, they each wrote zero.
1652	It offers lackluster fantasy propped up by cliches. Kallen's story deserves better.
1653	Director Alexander Payne has taken a combination father-son bonding story-road movie and made it feel entirely fresh.... mostly because of the delicate, lovely, bittersweet tone he conjures up and sustains throughout the entire movie. 
1654	The great tragedy underlying the story of Father O'Grady is how many children might not have been victims, had Cardinal Roger Mahoney ... been more interested in protecting the children residing in his diocese rather than furthering his own ascendancy wit
1655	A clever, tense thriller that loses steam toward the end.
1656	This delightful sex farce, co-starring the young and very handsome Cary Grant, is the only Mae West film to be Oscar-nominated, and it could not have been made a year later due to the restrictions of the Production Code.
1657	Knocked Up touches places most comedies wouldn't dare, some of them scarily biological, some of them scarily accurate. It's the sleeper hit of the summer, but don't worry: it's much better than that.
1658	Arteta directs one of the best ensemble casts of the year
1659	"McDonagh's ""In Bruges"" is one of the great cinematic works of the new century. ""Three Billboards"" doesn't come close, even though it traffics in similar crackling dialogue and tremendous performances."
1660	Too much of the narrative falls back on plot twists that come out of nowhere for us to care much about the fate of its characters.
1661	This is one of these films that you either love or hate. I loved it.
1662	Isn't an insult to Milne's beloved creation, but it's not a particularly noteworthy addendum to it either.
1663	When the ride looks and feels as smooth as this, it's practically irrelevant to complain about any lack of so-called substance.
1664	Once again, Chris Columbus stays out of J.K. Rowling's way, sticking to the text and hitting each narrative beat cleanly and vigorously.
1665	Structurally innovative, if not terribly insightful, look at sex in the digital age.
1666	I have seen many stupid movies in my life. But [this] would still count among the stupidest, had I seen twice a many movies in half again as many genres.
1667	Gorgeously shot, beautifully written and brought to vivid life by an assortment of wonderful performances, Selma is stunningly powerful, emotive and indispensable filmmaking. 
1668	The greatest pleasures come from the acting.
1669	Del Toro, co-writing with Matthew Robbins, nurtures the stately tone of Victorian times so he can haunt its romanticism with deeply repressed sins. 
1670	The only thing that saddens me about this little gem of a movie is that it may not be seen by anyone.
1671	As ridiculous as this stuff is, you'd swear that the cast and crew were simply making it up as they go.
1672	Louis Malle's supremely stylish New Wave thriller combines Miles Davis's music, Henri Decae's wonderfully evocative black-and-white cinematography of Paris and plenty of close-ups of a young Jeanne Moreau looking very anguished.
1673	"While there are a few intriguing themes and ideas at play in ""The Vanishing of Sidney Hall,"" once the viewer perseveres through the over-editing the final product is disappointing."
1674	Consistently hilarious, even borderline genius, and the most fun you'll have in a cinema this year.
1675	What fails to launch is anything remotely convincing or appealing.
1676	Nicholson is good, but the movie isn't.
1677	There are touching themes universal to all ages, love for both its charming protagonists and the Disney brand as a whole, and it continues to turn the traditional vision of a Disney Princess upside down
1678	In the end, it's difficult to reconcile the young Elizabeth depicted here with the monarch whose reign spans the longest in British history. The two just don't match up.
1679	A smarmy proposition passing itself off as family fun in the style of The Bad News Bears.
1680	Costner's performance really is powerful. What it all means remains a mystery.
1681	Mel Gibson's labor of love about the death of Jesus is incredibly labored, recasting his Crucifixion in crimson, slo-mo cliches.
1682	Austen's fans will recognise something of the author's playful wit in the film, and forgive the dramatic liberties.
1683	Edward Burns certainly doles out his fair share of family turmoil, but he admirably doesn't make lunatics out of his characters. 
1684	With a more lively production, the holes in the story could have been ignored, but the cost of the director's slow gate is that the audience has more time to dwell on the film's improbabilities.
1685	Nebraska has much merit, but for Payne it is a little underwhelming.
1686	It's a curious story indeed, a long and rambling exploration of time and what we make of it.
1687	Funny at times, scary at others, and thought provoking throughout.
1688	The story reaches a critical mass of muddled implausibility when an already suspicious protagonist is revealed to be homicidally untrustworthy and the Cloverfield beastie gets a moment in the sun.
1689	[Director] Baratz's access to every stage of the process -- from Zopa's selection of a candidate to the testing of that candidate to the blessing of the Dalai Lama himself -- is phenomenal, almost indescribably privileged.
1690	Spiking sentimental family values with crude hilarity isn't the recipe for an award winner.
1691	It does what few comedies achieve, literally giving me a laugh a minute, sometimes good, deep belly laughs. 
1692	Like the gags, many of the cameos don't pack a whole lot of punch, but enough succeed so that the viewer leaves with a mildly favorable impression. Regrettably, this is probably more a function of human psychology than moviemaking skill.
1693	If you don't ask too many questions, or just accept that it's all a dream so logic and science don't matter, then this is an enjoyable romp.
1694	It works as a throwaway joke -- occasionally funny and often shamelessly tasteless. And it also helps if you like Shore.
1695	Trainspotting is a searing pop-art portrait of a lost generation blowing out its brains. As they rail, chuckle, shout and dive into darkness, you're trapped yourself between a bellylaugh and a scream.
1696	A terrific atmospheric thriller.
1697	A Juilliard-trained musician, accomplished actor and busy TV director, Vondie Curtis Hall is probably too smart to be directing stories like Waist Deep.
1698	"A Most Wanted Man"" allows Hoffman to go out with not only one of his best performances, but one that epitomizes his strengths."
1699	... it's the performances that make this picture compelling in spite of its snail's-pace narrative.
1700	"We Have a Pope"" has great heart."
1701	Once you can see past the fraudulent release strategy, you get a disappointing sci-fi full of ideas and lacking of answers. [Full review in Spanish]
1702	The hype was right. No Country for Old Men is basically flawless.
1703	"Skyfall"" is thrilling, it's funny, it's moving and it's the one thing that James Bond movies never, ever used to be - surprising. "
1704	A love story like they don't make any more, except I'm not certain that they ever really did.
1705	Here we go all over again? Not exactly. This sequel...is not only tighter and funnier than its predecessor, but takes on sexism, a looming concern for the parents of toddler Stella
1706	Shoddy screenwriting devices simply pass the time for Whitney to sling hillbilly-isms at admirers of his stand-up comedy.
1707	Cooper and Lawrence Shine in Linings.
1708	It could have been an extraordinary story in a familiar framework; instead, it's a conventional story with a few extraordinary moments.
1709	In the film, Alvin and the Chipmunks proudly align themselves not with Dr. Demento, but with Kidz Bop.
1710	...a klutzy, long-winded, far-fetched and not-all-that-funny affair that somehow flashes an unobjectionable charm when expectations are kept low.
1711	What it lacks in cinematic flair it makes up for in the sincerity of its approach and the remarkable performances of Greenwood and Culp.
1712	Wild Wild West is a farce that's occasionally funny, often in a rather laboured way, occasionally thrilling and more than occasionally puerile.
1713	Refreshingly sour for a rom-com, but there's so little chemistry between the leads that we never believe them or root for them as a couple
1714	The fatal flaw of Eat Pray Love is that for a celebration of enlightenment through travel and the benefits of restorative calm, the end result is so hollow and artificial. Don't mistake entitlement for enlightenment.
1715	Waist Deep is just another one of those middle-of-the-road action flicks.
1716	Alive with humanity and wit.
1717	Like a pig-iron fisted metaphor, Astro Boy the film resembles the robot, in that it is cobbled together out of parts we recognise. And as much as they don't sound like they could all work in one film, they don't.
1718	Jude Law, of course, plays Alfie, and the casting is right on target. ... His smile can disarm even the most jaded.
1719	Albert Nobbs isn't exactly offensive or discriminatory; it just dances around all the interesting sexual politics at its core and is content to be a totally by-the-numbers period piece. A singular movie, this ain't.
1720	The story is dismayingly ordinary and its execution by director David Gelb is virtually devoid of invention.
1721	The tone of You, Me and Dupree is smarmy in that institutional way that doesn't seem to know what the tongue is doing in the cheek, exactly, but keeps it there just in case.
1722	Either an act of subversive genius or a strangely conservative scolding in the guise of a dumb comedy.
1723	The animation is spellbinding, the characters are ultra-cool and the action is nonstop.
1724	Few actors have the ability to make you believe they are an old man and a young boy at the same time. [Brad]Pitt has a blast with the part...
1725	There is truly never a dull moment but that's not the same thing as good ones.
1726	Manages time and again to deliver familiar notes that it then jazzes up.
1727	The movie culminates with a sloppily edited car chase that goes on for so long that I had to be reminded: Was Matt Damon playing Jason Bourne or Sheriff Buford T. Justice?
1728	Kevin Kline is by far the best thing in this movie, which is otherwise so overloaded with oddball characters that it never finds an even keel.
1729	A self-conscious but surprisingly entertaining fusion of gangster, martial-arts and western movies.
1730	White, who has a knack for imparting a sense of humor to his screenplays, created several minor characters who lighten the Retail Rodeo's claustrophic atmosphere.
1731	A direct expression from the soul onto celluloid, unvarnished and uncompromised, and Schrader's best film in years.
1732	An overly ambitious special-effects comedy obviously influenced by the success of Ghostbusters.
1733	Sharing much of its cinematic DNA with the type of captivating, classy horror Hollywood had been producing at the time, where it deviates from this, it does so in genuinely fascinating ways, not least in the emotionally brutal ending.
1734	Transports characters and altered states with the spunk of a deadly game of Go Fish.
1735	The filmmaker paints a blurry picture of a doped-up dope on a quest to find, well, I don't know. More drugs? Himself? Closure? Does Doc even know, or care? Should we?
1736	Hyper-stylised, cold, cerebral, difficult, stylish, at times visually sublime and at times unintentionally humorous, Cosmopolis is David Cronenberg back in Cronenberg Land ... You can't say it's anything other than unique.
1737	Bill Murray and Scarlett Johansson make the first classic romance of the new century glow with gorgeous, luminous grace.
1738	Overall, a complete misfire given the talent involved.
1739	'Call Me by Your Name' warmly and objectively captures the exhilaration and heartbreak of first love. It floats by like a cloud and softly embraces you like a tender hug.
1740	Unusually for a studio picture, the basic elements of filmmaking - script, acting, editing and even the soundtrack choices - are below par in The Darkest Minds.
1741	Perfect for the very youngest viewers.
1742	While not necessarily queer cinema's most revelatory offering, Love, Simon is more charming than anticipated, with some truly heartwarming moments.
1743	Buoyed by infectious high spirits and self-deprecating humour, the film works in strange and perhaps unintentional ways, thanks largely to the sustained energy of the lead actors, and writers Ernest Cline and Adam F. Goldberg.
1744	There's nothing more satisfying during a summer of event movies than a spy thriller like The Bourne Identity that's packed with just as much intelligence as action.
1745	Grungy, muddy-looking, and completely beholden to Alien for all its money moments, The Being is Z-grade schlock-slinging at its most obvious.
1746	An effective mix of animation, stock footage, and rear projection.
1747	Something about the large scope of the action confounds Stallone, and his excessively large number of unit directors. It's too hectic, too confusing to be cool, or exhilirating.
1748	Where Paper Heart does shine, however, is in the reflections of the general public and few will fail to be moved by their truly inspiring and heartwarming stories of true love.
1749	Like a medium-grade network sitcom--mostly inoffensive, fitfully amusing, but ultimately so weightless that a decent draft in the auditorium might blow it off the screen.
1750	Stanton should go back to making machines talk. He puts much more humanity into them than he manages to extract from Burroughs, even with all that nostalgia working for him. 
1751	The metaphysical moments inspire, but the earth bound action is mundane in the pejorative sense.
1752	Cusack in particular seems to have embellished his role with an assortment of verbal quirks that suggest he wasn't too happy with what was on the page.
1753	Robin Williams cae en el tipo de personaje que ha venido interpretando hasta el cansancio: el del hombre bueno que es todo emociones y que es capaz de llorar amargamente
1754	The best thing to do is to leave the theater, look the other way, and pretend it never happened.
1755	Did Lane and John Cusack really have to put themselves through this? Here are two first-rate actors in the embarrassing situation of playing blithering misfits in a lame comedy of errors.
1756	Fincher, the director of Seven, leads you down a murky winding path of dark, dank cellars and alleys in which water drips incessantly and blood and sweat flow and coalesce as if choreographed by a Balanchine.
1757	... [Jane] Campion is on solid ground here, and she treads it respectfully.
1758	The movie began life as a macabre postbellum western for DC Comics. Now it's lumbering action-camp following a video game plot.
1759	Flawed crime comedy pairs sex with violence. 
1760	Almost sinks into silliness.
1761	It's easy to see why The Imitation Game has been so well received. The story of Alan Turing is both fascinating and disturbing.
1762	What starts off as another seeming teenboy-targeted flick celebrating would-be gangbangers becomes a more interesting docudrama about a kidnapping turned tragic in Nick Cassavetes's Alpha Dog.
1763	The special effects feel rather synthetic for a big-time summer blockbuster. When the smoke finally clears Hancock emerges as just another routine riff on the superhero genre
1764	Movie, we need to talk. I don't think it's working out. I'll just tell you straight -- I've been seeing other movies.
1765	One of the best American-style thrillers we've seen in a long time.
1766	They seem to have put some effort into this one, rather than just cranking it out and shoving it into theaters.
1767	"A lot of movies released into theaters deserve the label of ""bad."" Only a few cross the line into ""reprehensible."" Say hello to Identity Thief."
1768	The sound alone is astonishing. Morricone's haunting, wistful score adds measurably to the sweep and timelessness of the film.
1769	It's not particularly good as a movie but as a collection of jokes it's pretty sublime.
1770	Content to wrap up in a politically-neutral and inoffensively tidy fashion that doesn't offend our intelligence. 
1771	A bizarre thing, this trippy movie takes you on a whirlwind tour of Brit glam rock and doesn't let go. Graphic and unforgiving, but good.
1772	Formulaic multiplex mulch, way over-long, often feels strained...That said, Identity Thief is the latest example of the disconnect that often exists between critical opinion and popular appeal. Slammed by critics the low-budget film has been a huge hit.
1773	It is a symphony of emotional release, the weight and majesty of life's miseries and joys all on vibrant display.
1774	even if it sometimes simplifies the historical issues in favor of uncomplicated multiplex feel-good uplift, it's hard not to get swept up in the joy
1775	It's subtly funny in the way it toys with the cliches of the genre.
1776	Nobody who hasn't spent time in an asylum could have believed that this film was ever going to amount to anything.
1777	One to cross off your CV Marty
1778	The kids and adults can dig this one, though adults may be stricken with Disney deja vu by this point.
1779	he mood shifts awkwardly from broad comedy to melodrama and social commentary.
1780	Cutesy, cuddly pap.
1781	Unlike most con-man movies, plot takes a back seat to character, and what the film lacks in dramatic logic it makes up for in depth.
1782	The direction is ever more pedestrian, and the characters increasingly resemble so much warm tapioca.
1783	At best, a schlock sci-fi movie that has the quality of a straight-to-video sequel. And at worst, it should have us worried about the direction of the Cloverfield franchise as a whole.
1784	As impressive as [Charlize Theron's] transformation is, it's likely to spawn more discussions about acting than about the topic at hand.
1785	One of the best blockbusters of the year and certainly a smarter and more intelligent action movie than most released during the silly Summer season.
1786	Chadwick Boseman delivers a precise impersonation of Brown's gravelly voice and eccentric moves, and even lends emotional weight to the few scenes that deserve it. However, his role feels more like a series of bullet points than an organic character. 
1787	The immensely slow-building tension of the piece grows irresistibly suffocating.
1788	Certain movies are sprinkled with pixie dust, an indescribable concoction that infuses scenes with irresistible magic; Silver Linings Playbook is practically hand-rolled and deep-fried in the stuff. 
1789	Peter Jackson returns to the Middle Earth he rendered so faithfully in Lord of the Rings, and it's never looked so glorious.
1790	A movingly sympathetic and perceptive portrayal about an unwanted rebellious adolescent.
1791	At the end of the two and a half hours we get to the same point of all the other stereotypical chick flicks. This is an overly intellectual version of any other Jennifer Lopez or Kate Hudson romantic comedy.
1792	While the film's basic premise is unusual and in parts interesting, it loses steam in the second half.
1793	Utterly boring.
1794	Pulpy Southern immorality tale is for adults only.
1795	There's a great idea here, but it's buried within a muddled story that lurches between dark comedy and maudlin drama.
1796	Whether this is your first trip or you're a charter passenger, Serenity is a wild ride -- and, if things work out, not the last.
1797	It mirrors the first movie but it adds a femenist perspective to it. [Full review in Spanish]
1798	It features lots of heartache, a downer of an ending, and even some nasty bloodshed. But in the end, it just feels like they forgot to add something in there, but it still comes out as a pretty good film nonetheless.
1799	The directors and screenwriters hit all their marks and push all the right buttons, but the story never really takes off, and the characters never really spark to life.
1800	It just felt like something was missing. nothing about this movie was very exciting. I'd say it was just a very average Sci-fi movie. 
1801	Mangold went to so much trouble to give Stallone a good role, but he forgot to write good parts for Robert De Niro, Harvey Keitel, Ray Liotta, Annabella Sciorra and Cathy Moriarity.
1802	As with the previous Step Up films, there's very little to dislike here. The filmmakers know what their loyal audiences want - and it's not great acting but loads and loads of...street dancing.
1803	A big disappointment.
1804	Much more effectively terrifying than the usual overplotted, underwritten Hollywood thriller.
1805	If Cosmopolis remains chilly and remote, it does so in a way that often feels unsettlingly familiar.
1806	It's corny, but it's also pretty cool.
1807	For all its visual splendor, to say nothing of its likable cast, the movie never feels as liberating as its locale.
1808	Lee wants to combine a landmark moment with a coming-of-age story, but his style here is so loose and rambling it's impossible to sense the excitement of the former and the particularity of the latter.
1809	There's no attempt to break the genre mold here; The Darkest Minds all but embraces its obvious influences.
1810	A film with no heart, and one that's less than the sum of its mediocre parts.
1811	A shoddy Best Picture.
1812	If you enjoy watching a lead character that's so annoying and such a jerk that you'd like to punch him in the face yourself, then The Green Hornet is for you.
1813	This humorous, lively, and entertaining picture could be described as a caper film set against a WW II backdrop.
1814	Alternately violent and tedious road movie of the post-apocalyptic variety that remains watchable thanks to some odd touches and an interesting performance from Robert Pattinson.
1815	A strange, wonderfully exotic quest that examines the impact of rapid colonization and the obsessive thirst for knowledge. 
1816	Like the movie created around her, [Bjork is] nothing short of hypnotic.
1817	Cradle has everything -- except plot and a reason for Li's name-above -the-title billing.
1818	One of the most beautiful love stories ever told.
1819	Every other week, it seems there is some new creation full of fantastically realized creatures engaging in eye-tricking action. The ironic effect of this... is a so-what-else-you-got state of jaded exhaustion. And then along comes Rango.
1820	The film may lack great depth, but it is a visual treat about films within films and packed with top performances.
1821	The Hopkins fanboys are going to be much happier with the movie than just about anyone else, because frankly, there's not much besides that to go on.
1822	Let's face it. Mr. Ford is in love with Ireland, as is his cast, and they give us a fine, gay time while they're about it.
1823	Unquestionably dumb and distasteful, but stakes its claim as the funniest film of the season.
1824	An almost perfect expression of the genre...may not warm the heart, but it will make it jump for sheer joy at the cinematic exuberance it displays.
1825	This movie is just down right annoying.
1826	"The Light Between Oceans"" is both riveting and slow, emotionally moving and slightly distant."
1827	A lush period drama that also manages to criticize outmoded patriarchal standards.
1828	"The Wedding Date"" has a few good laughs and appealing leads, but it never achieves the lift off of a real sparkling romantic comedy."
1829	Anyone seeking proof that a movie can transcend its subject should look to Silver Linings Playbook.
1830	It will overjoy viewers looking for a leisurely fantasy departure and bore to tears others hoping for another Matrix.
1831	Generates the kind of low-wattage creepiness that helps compensate for its lack of resonance.
1832	It has just the right combination of giddy fantasy, exciting adventure, wonderful special effects, and sly comedy.
1833	No Country for Old Men isn't the first great movie certain to have its ending criticized even by many who enjoyed the rest of the picture.
1834	Entertainment on a par with sitting through your neighbours' holiday slideshow.
1835	The most disturbing notion that lingers in the mind of anyone who'll see Texas Chainsaw Massacre: The Beginning is that the franchise may have even more to offer.
1836	Paranoid Park is graced with those peculiar Van Sant touches of discovery and absurdity, delightful because they're at once so right and so inscrutable.
1837	Sprawling circus tale is a visual feast with heavy themes.
1838	The performance sequences feel intimate and exhilarating -- but in the end, Li's journey is compelling only when he's onstage.
1839	Why would you want to meet such a blowsy, bawdy, shticky crew in a low-comedy sequel to Meet the Parents? Two reasons only: Barbra Streisand and Dustin Hoffman.
1840	Well worth seeing on the big screen, Memoirs of a Geisha is ultimately a film you admire, rather than embrace.
1841	If Allen's next stop on his Euro tour is anywhere near this enjoyable, consider our bags packed.
1842	A slick, ensemble melodrama that appears to touch on every female issue regarding motherhood, family and relationships.
1843	I truly doubt Hollywood will produce anything this year that bottoms Alpha Dog for offensively bad filmmaking.
1844	It may be too soon to call Identity Thief the worst film of the year, but there's no doubt that it will be a contender.
1845	"The filmmakers need to re-watch ""Ocean's Eleven"" study up, and remind themselves of this important fact: Even teenagers want a movie that makes them think."
1846	Julianne Moore's lead turn is towering and momentous, the work of an actor whose awe-inspiring natural talent knows no limits. Watching her in this role provides a thrill that not even some of the best action films could hope to attain.
1847	A visual, poetic journey not unlike Coppola's Apocalypse Now.
1848	Director Roger Donaldson's taut, understated thriller pulls you into a powerfully engaging situation. 
1849	Perceptive [and] deeply engaging.
1850	The Hobbit may not be as memorable as the Lord of the Rings trilogy, but it's a mostly faithful adaptation that sticks to the same tones and themes of the source material.
1851	Eastwood's filmmaking here is laboriously tasteful and painfully restrained to the point of complete atrophy. 
1852	Think of Valkyrie as a reasonably entertaining drama about the time Tom Cruise tried to kill Hitler. Do that, and it becomes possible to enjoy the movie.
1853	The words creak with calculated composition that never sufficiently capture the foreignness of the situations or individuality of people.
1854	Watching these likable actors flounder around as they try to save a picture that's not worth saving is, well, depressing.
1855	Dull dialogue, a dull story, and dull animation. What's left?
1856	For a movie that makes such a big deal about color, Pleasantville is awfully black and white.
1857	A merciless and mirthlessly funny antiwar weapon from a filmmaker who has seen battle firsthand and has lived to make art from memories of hell.
1858	Gorgeous, but also very violent.
1859	A brilliantly orchestrated ode to the heart and soul of modern-day Italy.
1860	No movie called Mars Needs Moms has any right being this good. But it is.
1861	As pop as it is arthouse, as funny as it is tragic, Donnie Darko remains a remarkable one-off that's easy to adore.
1862	Here's a novel idea: A kids' movie with parents as heroes. That twist is the most -- some might say only -- refreshing element in Mom and Dad Save the World.
1863	A lush, coming of age tale that makes you want to take a vacation.
1864	This film's ideal medium is video.
1865	X-Men fans may disagree, but this is Singer's best work since The Usual Suspects.
1866	... it is pretty funny, if exaggerated to cartoonish extremes and contrived beyond belief.
1867	A work of grand visual wit, clever songs, funny gags and genuine pathos, it is perhaps the greatest stop-motion animated film ever, a painstaking style of model animation that computers have all but completely done away with.
1868	A by-the-numbers storyline, complete with character actions that don't make a lick of sense because of how underdeveloped they are.
1869	As he proved last year, David Fincher can make the inherently uncinematic into thrilling cinema. Fincher is the right director to make a movie where two people rifle through endless amounts of paperwork and old photos suspenseful.
1870	by turns raucously funny, tender, defiant, sad and hopeful. It is a movie that rises to something like greatness on the writing and acting -- and the charisma of its star. 
1871	By the time we leave the theater, the warmth of love has melted the coldest heart.
1872	It's not lack of a strong story that keeps I Am David from taking off. Blame a straightforward approach that makes the movie feel too much like an after-school special.
1873	In his desire to tell this story in the most comprehensive manner possible, Jackson seems to have forgotten one of cinema's most pleasurable tricks: the ability to cut to the chase.
1874	This movie is definitely geared toward blue-staters.
1875	an outsized romantic epic built on a potentially flimsy bit of fantastical whimsy that instead becomes an affecting allegory for the fleeting joys of life
1876	"A scene isn't a scene unless it leaves the audience completely numb, with ""Oceans"" unable to emerge from the dark, effectively destroying whatever richly mournful qualities were found in the source material. "
1877	"Safety"" can't sustain its own offbeat energy. By the end, even Aubrey Plaza would roll her eyes at it."
1878	While hardly the most novel of stories, what puts Bart Got a Room above the norm is a tight and charming screenplay and Hecker's way with mood and place.
1879	It's like flipping through five years of dog calendars.
1880	This is real American history being made, you think - and regular Americans making it. But then, those are the Americans who always do.
1881	First-time writer-director Serry shows a remarkable gift for storytelling with this moving, effective little film.
1882	The brightly written script by Jim Uhls literally bursts with memorable lines that will have you laughing and thinking.
1883	This is a blast of a B Movie, featuring cool chase sequences, Peter Jackson-style gross-outs, and generally just good-old over-the-top, by-the-skin-of-the-fingernails fun. Good title pun too. And those Hawaiian vistas, of course, are sheer eye-pudding.
1884	The blueprint for how to do projects like this right: care about your material, but don't lose your sense of humor.
1885	A gorgeous time capsule capturing the manners and mores of America at the start of the conservative Eisenhower era, bristling with a pair of lead performances that stand among the year's best.
1886	Foster should get frequent crier miles for this role; she shifts her character into panic mode so quickly that we also have no trouble believing she could be losing her marbles.
1887	Maybe the flaws are proof that audiences are, we can hope, becoming better at sniffing out a fizzer and refusing to encourage mediocrity.
1888	Delivers many of the absurd pleasures of opera.
1889	There are almost enough fresh elements to make the movie worthwhile.
1890	If you think it's a good idea to begin a movie for children by killing off a young boy in an industrial accident as his father looks on, raise your hand. Anyone?
1891	Sorry, Pedro, but this tepid trudge through the shallow stuff of men is most remarkable for being such a dramatic under-performer.
1892	I Origins challenges too little and ties up things too neatly for it to register as anything more than well-made, well-intentioned hogwash.
1893	Dame Judi Dench gives a warm and compelling performance in Philomena, a fact-based drama of maternal love and eternal regrets.
1894	This delightful film focuses on the more telling years when Edward D. Wood did what he did to become who he is...
1895	It's never more than ridiculous popcorn fun, but the fun is thin on the ground.
1896	Matthew Sexiest Man Alive McConaughey ought to be in Westerns, but not many are being made. So he plays a walking, winky pin-up in Failure to Launch, which may launch commercially but is a failure.
1897	One dollar to your favorite charity if you can guess which creatures are animatronic and which computer-generated.
1898	Director DuVernay has crafted a cinematic work for the ages, with a magnificent performance from Oyelowo.
1899	A Perfect Getaway is a clever, heart-pounding thriller, and a welcome return to form for the director.
1900	It's undeniably a good thing that it exists, that we have a wide-release movie that treats homosexuality as normal and natural, is about a gay kid, and even directed by a gay man. I just hope that it paves the way for better such movies down the line.
1901	Wonderland represents another low-rung on the downward descent of actor Val Kilmer.
1902	When it works, it works well, and there are several laugh-out-loud moments and a couple of believably tender scenes.
1903	Funny in places but not really a comedy. This one gives Tina Fey a chance to show off her acting chops. She's fabulous. 
1904	Can Eminem act? Yes, I am happy to report.
1905	The slapstick, quick timing, and colorful characters may keep the kids occupied, but the sharp dialogue and tender moments will make the adults enjoy it even more.
1906	Chappaquiddick ... treats this version Ted with a level of understanding that belies what the movie contends he did.
1907	What could have been a breezy, thrilling stand-alone film is instead a long, sometimes tedious, excursion.
1908	All the lush sets and elaborate costumes cannot disguise the fact that Portman is terribly cast.
1909	If Bolt does not quite rise to the level of bona fide Pixar masterpieces like Wall-E, Finding Nemo and Ratatouille, it does manage to be frisky, funny and inventive enough to engage the attention of grown-ups as well as children.
1910	Brilliantly spooky.
1911	Many will leave the theatre with a smile on their face but in my eyes, Hitchcock focuses on the wrong characters and tries too hard to please.
1912	As old-fashioned, sentimental romances go, this well-played Kleenex saga is slightly above average.
1913	An enjoyable film to watch.
1914	All the pieces converge in a powerful rush during the second half.
1915	"By the time the film reaches its biblically inspired dreamscape of a climax, ""Black Nativity"" qualifies as equal parts surreal and stirring."
1916	While watching it, I kept thinking I have finally seen it - the clear best film of the year, then the film gets to a critical point and literally stops.
1917	Flashy gadgets and whirling fight sequences may look cool, but they can't distract from the flawed support structure holding Equilibrium up.
1918	As a lover of cinema, Jackson's film bored me rigid; as a lover of Tolkien, it broke my heart.
1919	Eminem steals the picture from a cast with snap down to the smallest parts.
1920	A lavishly-made retro-thriller. Further proof that Guillermo del Toro is one of the best genre directors of our era. 
1921	That the film is so convincing and so engaging despite the lack of dialogue is an unquantifiable triumph.
1922	"Alfred Hitchcock's ""Vertigo"" is an artistic triumph for the master of mystery."
1923	The intent is to create a living nightmare of psychological horror, and Aronofsky succeeds most unsettlingly.
1924	Hitchcock was elsewhere an entertainer, often a great one, but Vertigo finds him working as an artist...
1925	Nebraska is black and white ninja of sentiment. You won't know what hit you until the damage has already been done.
1926	The slapstick here is nothing to rent the film over. Oddly, it's the serious moments that charm. I was embarrassed to myself for being choked up by Mel Brooks. 
1927	"Palo Alto"" feels earnest and promising, but half-formed."
1928	If nothing else, No Country should win an award for Best Use of an Oxygen Tank.
1929	Spade proves that it's plenty easy to mock former child actors, but it's actually enterprising to directly involve them in the plot.
1930	Sharif still has that twinkle in his eye and a commanding screen presence.
1931	The second, and now third installments have turned into meandering messes with few jokes that land and a cast that, while talented, doesn't really get to do much.
1932	Beneath the film's satire beats a heart of mush.
1933	"Invictus"" is only interested in South Africa and the challenges of reconciliation as a background setting and inspiring theme, not as a real place or a real problem; it's a thin, hollow shell designed expressly to be coated in Oscar gold."
1934	It's equal parts deadly action, deadpan comedy and knotty mystery.
1935	The Edge of Seventeen may not revolutionise the sub-genre, but it's more articulate than most and harks back visually and thematically to the seriousness of John Hughes's The Breakfast Club, still the mother lode of disturbed teen movies.
1936	Paper Heart gets by on easygoing charm, rather like Yi herself, whose low-fi comedy is built upon us rooting for her, perhaps hoping that surely there's more magnetism to her than this.
1937	Far from pining for their glory days, Wright and company are living them now. The World's End looks, despite its title, like just the beginning for all involved.
1938	It proves [the Coens] can hold an audience in thrall with the simplest of cinema's elements: a memorable image.
1939	...what we basically have here is a summer movie disguised as a sci-fi epic. On that level, it works.
1940	nowhere near classic status
1941	An earnest, emotionally accurate, but seriously flawed drama.
1942	Gets by well enough on style and star chemistry and the basic allure of watching a tightly-planned caper unfold.
1943	Will Smith almost redeems generic man vs. machine actioner.
1944	Sometimes when a movie gets boring, I start to wish that a shark would eat someone, just for some diversion. This marks the first time that wish has ever come true.
1945	This is one of Moore's defining performances, and it is a brave one.
1946	As a sadistic dallas cop who moonlights as a hit man, Matthew McConaughey is on fire in Killer Joe, fierce and ferociously funny.
1947	Do the dinosaurs work? Indeed they do. Does anything else? Not really.
1948	Burton makes good use of all the possibilities offered by the plot and gives us some wildly original creatures, most notably Michael Keaton as the terrible Beetlejuice.
1949	Wright and Co. have produced another excellent comedy that, although it falls a little short of their previous two films, still delivers all the laughs that we've come to expect from the trio.
1950	A tormented movie about torment; loopy, over-reaching and occasionally suspicious. Simultaneously, it is a daring artistic endeavour.
1951	A comic gem with an exquisitely photographed Paris forming an elegant backdrop.
1952	A minor work from Brokeback Mountain director Ang Lee that is enjoyable but ultimately underwhelming.
1953	Conspicuous assets are the striking color photography and the musical score, both of which help a great deal in enhancing the drama's savage and soulful moods.
1954	Soul Power works fabulously as both a concert film and a time capsule of a time and place when gods of black masculinity joined forces to make an international statement of togetherness.
1955	For moviegoers who don't share Mel Gibson's religious agenda, it's nothing but an unpleasant experience.
1956	Carries an overpowering scent of writerly affectation.
1957	Only in the movies can Joey Fatone and Andrea Martin engage in Hellenic dance.
1958	Big, long, ultimately tedious
1959	Not surprisingly, gags about gambling and strippers ensue. Also not surprisingly, the lightweight laughs dissolve into eye-rolling melodrama.
1960	This hilarious teen comedy is directed by Kelly Fremon-Craig and stars Hailee Steinfeld as Nadine, a charming, yet neurotic teenager on the edge of adulthood. 
1961	"In some ways this story is as old as the movies, but ""The Mambo Kings"" is so filled with energy, passion and heedless vitality that it seems new, anyway."
1962	While Foxx and Union carry the proceedings with humor and charm to burn, the lightweight script isn't quite clever enough to untangle their web without resorting to middlebrow obviousness.
1963	...a solid man-against-nature tale...
1964	A funny, charming movie. The cast is loveable and believable.
1965	The movie is wonderfully written, beautifully acted and gorgeously photographed. If only director and screenwriter Derek Cianfrance hadn't fallen so deeply in love with his own overlong, five-hankie script.
1966	While it is definitely geared more towards the social media generation, anyone with bittersweet memories of school life will laugh and wince in equal measure.
1967	Fantastic Four, for all of its super effects and glossy finish, is a hollow movie experience.
1968	A film that manages to be uncommonly thoughtful and sensitive to the complexity of its very faulted characters while still being relentlessly, brilliantly funny.
1969	Four-play without any climax.
1970	It's not quite as enchanted or magical as it could have been, but this family romp still manages to be good fun, and is lifted by fantastic turns from Amy Adams and James Marsden.
1971	Bright Star is literate, romantic and high-minded.
1972	A reminder that 'sanity' doesn't make your flaws any more orderly.
1973	Content to charm our pants off rather than set our imagination on fire.
1974	Is Skyfall the best Bond film yet? No. Is it a smart and engaging Bond film? Absolutely.
1975	A pale imitation of the early novels of Bret Easton Ellis, who wrote about young ennui and aimlessness from the inside out. 
1976	A resolutely average sequel, several subbasements below the first film in both comic inspiration and energy.
1977	While I did enjoy much of Depp's performance, and while Jolie emanated a radiant beauty that jumped right off the screen, neither generated a bright enough spark to make up for the script's numerous shortcoming.
1978	Guadagnino creates an evocative understanding of time and place, generating a sincere picture, and one that taps into the blur of primal longing. 
1979	Silent Hill is mostly paralyzing in its vagueness.
1980	The movie, which was shot in chronological order in the countries Gilbert visited, is also visually striking, more reminiscent of a travelogue than a Hollywood blockbuster.
1981	Udderly ordinary.
1982	Edie Sedgwick may have been too elusive and too fractured to be easily explained. Factory Girl is a good try with some great acting. But as with its subject, it's both too much and not enough.
1983	Even if you've never seen a Gene Roddenberry creation, it's still a hoot.
1984	the film ends with a muddle; several stories have been shown onscreen but none of them have really said anything.
1985	Underrated Don Siegel heist drama
1986	Soderbergh's here to have fun, and his mood is contagious.
1987	Unfortunately, the flies aren't so compelling.
1988	a cheap-looking amalgam of previously used horror effects, with not a single fresh idea of its own except to jam them together in one place.
1989	The story floats along in a philosophical swamp of empowerment mythology, theraspeak and materialism-as-personality that's as contemporary as Oprah's self-esteem empire.
1990	Steven Spielberg returns to the scary territory of Jaws and Jurassic Park and once again proves himself to be the most gifted movie entertainer of his generation.
1991	The worst action film of the year, and that's saying something.
1992	This rip-roaring slice of sci-fi excess remains Arnold Schwarzenegger's most satisfying film since his breakthrough hit, The Terminator.
1993	Filled with flights of outrageous excesses.
1994	Finds a rather cunning way to make a brutishly straightforward scenario seem profoundly muddled.
1995	Midnight in Paris is Allen's most charming, romantic and funny film in a long time.
1996	Apatow knows growing up is a rough patch of grass but he wants to understand it. Such lofty ambitions seem to have been largely banished from romantic comedies, but here, it gives Knocked Up an honest timelessness.
1997	fantastic
1998	One of my favorites of this young year and among the most unique features I've seen from an American animation house in recent memory.
1999	This is a movie that wants to break out and be tepid. It would like to dare to be tepid. But it just can't find the energy.
2000	In the first film, Singham could not care less about powerful people, but in this one he does not seem to care about the law anymore.
2001	Hartnett may grow into a major film star someday with better material, but this is a one-night stand he'll want to forget.
2002	Director Nick Park and those creative folks at Aardman Animations have carved out another toothy, gag-filled claymation treat.
2003	When Christopher McCandless went camping, he didn't mess around.
2004	It's not romantic in the slightest, and it is quite comedic on occasion, but the parts don't fit together at all.
2005	If you like your science-fiction lo-fi, and your coming of age parables with a handy technological metaphor at their core, Colin Trevorrow's Safety Not Guaranteed is the movie you've been waiting for.
2006	A fine example of Godard's experimental affronts to cinematic conventions, his exploration of the human condition, and his concern for social issues. [Blu-ray]
2007	Like every other inspiring teacher/coach movie, only less so.
2008	Haunted Ouija board picture--better than average performances help
2009	Offers less entertainment than just awareness of how nearly every American male role seems like it was intended for Harrison Ford.
2010	An improvement on Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone.
2011	There are good things in this combined coming-of-age and road trip story, but there's a hollowness to it -- not to mention a pretty unsatisfying ending.
2012	Disappointing, too violent, and not very funny.
2013	At least satisfying and often is poignant.
2014	Streisand and Hoffman are a hoot, the most entertaining Haight-Ashbury movie refugees since Lily Tomlin and Alan Alda similarly tormented Stiller in Flirting With Disaster.
2015	The cinematic American West is vast enough for us to fill with our imaginations, taking a simple shadow play and transforming it into an eternal campfire tale.
2016	If anything, Cosmopolis is more timely now than when DeLillo published it almost a decade ago.
2017	Some sort of mixed-up commentary on gentrification.
2018	The screenplay ties itself into a knot from the start, when it presents the founding of the nasty sorority as a feminist event.
2019	An unprecedented and unrivalled piece of entertainment.
2020	As a psychological study of secret agents, The Bourne Identity is too much carnival ride and not enough John le Carre.
2021	Sam Peckinpah doesn't find anything to cheer about when his Man expresses his rage.
2022	A deeply felt, haunting work that ranks among Eastwood's best films...
2023	...suffers from a pervadingly low-rent sensibility that proves impossible to overlook.
2024	More than a portrait of Mozart: a brilliant examination of the creative impulse and a subtle satire of man's limitations.
2025	It works best when it stays away from all the preachy overtones of other multi-character dramas like Crash, but it does stumble a bit in an attempt to spell everything out too conveniently.
2026	It's a mess, an all over the place, everything but the kitchen sink jamboree of potty humor, cheap shots and missed opportunities.
2027	It is extraordinarily bleak. I mean, it's not Requiem for a Dream bleak, but it's on up there.
2028	It strives to be something greater than a simple coming-of-age flick, and succeeds... 
2029	It's artless, obvious, and at times insultingly exaggerated.
2030	An engaging story about a remarkable person.
2031	An interesting depiction of the makings of a serial killer.
2032	Early production problems show, still fun Wilder
2033	Even the direction of Michel Gondry is a wipeout. The Frenchman was a late recruit to the project, but precious few glimpses of his trademark surrealism are detected.
2034	Something has been lost in the translation...another routine Hollywood frightfest in which the slack execution italicizes the absurdity of the premise.
2035	Ozon and his actresses work so hard at being funny that they seldom are.
2036	How nice it would have been had McKenna penned a couple of those audience-addressing interludes for Richard or Jack. What would these modern, succesful men tell us of themselves?
2037	A made-to-order cult item.
2038	All that passion behind the scenes doesn't really translate on screen.
2039	Forget the chimp nature vs. nurture angle, someone should study the humans.
2040	It's a shame that the original concept is so bad it doesn't even warrant polite applause.
2041	Unfortunately for You, Me and Dupree, it's easier to invest patience in people stumbling to find focus and purpose than films searching for the same things.
2042	Although Focus ... is frequently thought-provoking and well acted, it's not the success it should be.
2043	The Stath is pretty much the most bankable name in action movies today, and his unhinged work in High Voltage, indulging in an explosion of murder and mayhem with gusto and glee, should certainly see him retain that title.
2044	"Viciously delicious cult classic, flip side of ""The Breakfast Club."
2045	Even if the script isn't always subtle, Costner makes his flawed protagonist vividly real.
2046	Tommy Lee Jones gets mad respect for this.
2047	Let Cruise rant and jump on furniture all he wants. So long as he can churn out movies like this one, he's free to make a fool of himself all he wants.
2048	No one is better at this kind of performance than Nicolas Cage. He's a fearless actor. He doesn't care if you think he goes over the top. If a film calls for it, he will crawl to the top hand over hand with bleeding fingernails.
2049	Charming and frequently exciting.
2050	"The Miracle Season"" is a pleasant surprise, the rare inspirational sports movie that actually earns its tears."
2051	I think it's her most restrained film, in a lot of ways. It's very classic. It's very poetic. It embraces Keats poetry in the making of it.
2052	Pooh's Heffalump Movie is a simple, innocent winner with amazing vocal talent, entertaining music and an important lesson for kids.
2053	A smart but safe parable about how power can corrupt even the best of men, and how complacency is not a virtue.
2054	A masterwork that already has the feel of a classic. This take on the last days of an iconic western figure constantly surprises and intrigues.
2055	This is a long, impeccably detailed, richly textured movie about a most unusual life, and although it's far from perfect, the sum of it achieves what Fincher set out to do in the first place.
2056	An offbeat comedy with an appreciation for the seductions and dangers of sexual thrill-seeking.
2057	An insipid slice of take-charge-of-your-life hokum...
2058	While by no means a perfect film, I still found a lot to enjoy here. There have been at least two dozen superhero movies in the last six or seven years. It's kind of nice to see one that looks at things from the other side of the coin.
2059	Director Keith Gordon emphasizes the speeches more than other issues, and his otherwise thoughtful movie needlessly romanticizes hate. 
2060	The filmmaker's access was impressive, the results moderately entertaining.
2061	Kevin Kline, who has a gift for this kind of characterization, heads up a talented trio of actors, all playing extremely quirky characters who are borderline pathological, but funny and harmless.
2062	"All In"" is a lesser effort in this franchise, but not without its charms."
2063	The movie is good, solid le Carre. It's chilly yet humane, and human-scaled ...
2064	There is no denying the spectacle, the adventure, and the romance in How the West Was Won.
2065	Craig manages to steal each scene he's in with his bleached hair, impeccable Southern accent and hair-trigger personality. An Oscar nomination for Best Supporting Actor is likely.
2066	[It] may entertain easy-to-please younger children while disappointing more knowledgeable kids and parents.
2067	Pixar Animation spends an entire year on each of their mammoth productions on the scripts alone. Could this explain why their movies are consistently clever and entertaining?
2068	We watch with a kind of fascination, because Herzog cuts loose from narrative and follows his characters through the relentless logic of their adventure.
2069	A bleak parable.
2070	This is movie that sears the nerves, that immediately draws a line in the dirt and demands that you stand on one side or the other.
2071	With a delicate palette and soft tones, the craftsmanship on display is impeccable, but the pulse-free drama - think crying over spilled milk - makes for muted impact.
2072	Does its part to widen this historic concert's potential audience base.
2073	Bright Star is that rare and upbraiding thing, a film - perhaps the last one of the year - that seeks not to jam your emotions or scare you silly, but asks you to think about words.
2074	Feels like a mixed bag of smart ideas and nods to other pictures, rather than a coherent, distinct work of art.
2075	Have you ever chugged three Red Bulls right before a game of Grand Theft Auto? This ADD-infused action sequel...is a bit like that. Except even less family friendly.
2076	You purchase the ticket for the sensual slow-burn love story that develops between Elio and Oliver, captured against the gorgeous backdrop of Northern Italy, but you might find yourself moved to tears by the genuine appeal Stuhlbarg makes to his son.
2077	If eyes could eat, every pair would gobble up what Guillermo del Toro and cinematographer Dan Lausten have to offer and then ask for seconds.
2078	This amiable, old-fashioned family film is ... a straightforward fish-out-of-water tale with lessons for the little ones and a surprisingly earnest and moving performance from James Coburn.
2079	Tending to meander at times, there's still plenty to enjoy if typical Almodovar multiple narratives don't confuse you.
2080	Quite simply, Jaws is a masterclass in blockbuster entertainment -- a tense, exciting thriller that redefined contemporary cinema. They don't make them like this anymore.
2081	This movie goes for the heartstrings and tear ducts more than the sports-conscious. The results are pretty mixed.
2082	The joys of Hoffman's performance are evident on first viewing.
2083	It's more confusing than absorbing.
2084	Most of the way, the film feels more like a documentary about the couple than a corrosive study of either of them.
2085	Minimal in its delivery but brimming with heart and bittersweet moments.
2086	"Sometimes as shocking as a gunshot, ""The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford"" is nonetheless an artful examination of one of the most infamous slayings in American history"
2087	By following its story as closely as they have, the filmmakers have retained much of what made the novel a classic.
2088	Any movie with Meryl Streep is an occasion, but when you add Diane Keaton, Robert De Niro, Leonardo DiCaprio, Hume Cronyn and Gwen Verdon, you've got an embarrassment of riches.
2089	Guarantees that you'll never watch the source material in the same way again.
2090	Memoirs of a Geisha isn't just drop-dead beautiful, it's cinematically alive with a spirited way that makes most contrivances forgivable.
2091	[T]he sequel isn't an advertisement. This is a legitimate movie; it is also a legitimately bad one.
2092	At least Dancer in the Dark is bad in a complicated way.
2093	Whenever I see a great film, I get a literal high off it, almost like a drug. The feeling can last for days. The Artist gave me one of those highs. 
2094	Director Martin Ritt and screenwriters Harriet Frank, Jr., and Irving Ravetch rely too heavily on little vignette sequences to move the narrative, a technique that quickly becomes tedious and predictable.
2095	It's unfathomable how many times Hollywood has struck out in attempts to convert popular video/computer games into movies. This is the kind of misfire that reinforces negative stereotypes.
2096	Pure fluffy eye candy.
2097	A treat for people who like their horror movies brooding, bloody and laced with dark humor.
2098	A deliberately paced affair, slow sometimes to a fault but also simmering away ready to boil over at any moment, awash with a sense of paranoia and intrigue.
2099	A bittersweet, marvelously effective end of a certain goofy era, when friends banding together were enough to save the world. 
2100	The plot is labyrinthine, the direction televisual and the explanatory voiceover incessant, but a smattering of sharp one-liners hint at the series's enduring appeal.
2101	Mel Gibson's Passion, though well-acted, technically impressive and initially moving, is for the most part not beautiful and certainly not ennobling.
2102	Thrills are utterly lacking in the film.
2103	"At its worst, and best, ""Crimson Peak"" exists in a weird parallel world where very separate rules of logic apply. It's a true waking nightmare."
2104	Rango is clever and entertaining. Not for the very young perhaps, but ideal for teens and adults.
2105	It's a striking reminder of the power of memory and the idea that love lost isn't love wasted, a message that rings beautifully clear and universal no matter how singular and lasting the story of Elio and Oliver is.
2106	It's very slow, though it does offer a respite from the overactive animation that kids are mostly subjected to.
2107	Shakes the Clown is sick but whether it's a joke is a matter of taste. And this film is about as tasteless as they come.
2108	It's easy to see The Imitation Game as a triumph - after all, Turing accomplished what all the experts claimed was impossible - but it's equally apparent that underlying the triumph is a tragedy.
2109	The movie is all surface and trades on fortune-cookie wisdom and sitcom scenarios.
2110	A feel-good movie that should have felt even better.
2111	Hunt delivers one of the year's most appealing performances as a Brooklyn single mother.
2112	Brilliant classic of mind-game suspense.
2113	Diary of a Wimpy Kid is an adequate adaptation of Kinney's novel, but no replacement for the real thing.
2114	Her frank depiction of unseemly behaviour is heartbreakingly real, her tireless humanism a constant presence.
2115	While a few are touched by brilliance and a few more are mildly amusing, others provide ample opportunity for leaving the theater to buy popcorn or take a coffee break.
2116	Depp's depraved character does have twisted poignancy.
2117	Quick, literate, funny and filthy, a head-turning mix of high thoughts and low schemes.
2118	Kevin Hart screams a lot.
2119	For Ray Romano fans only.
2120	I just don't see much entertainment value--or, certainly, a shelf life--in a contrived string of mildly amusing parodies of bad movies. Here today, yawn tomorrow.
2121	Deserving of ending up in the latter part of its title ...
2122	Worlds better than a mess like Men in Black II.
2123	It's left to the wonderful Scott, with his satyr's face and killer timing, to carry the movie through thick and thin.
2124	The lesbian affair at its heart is rendered with intelligence and care, and if there are speeches to be made, they are happily few, and far more personal than political.
2125	Apparently, Schrader never intended to make a horror movie, much to the dismay of the studio.
2126	Sossamon and Fugit are so perfectly cast you can't help but sigh every time they glance at each other and their final scene is guaranteed to send you home with a smile a mile wide.
2127	Comical Woola, a faithful dog-like creature that travels at Road Runner superspeed, steals every scene. He's the 'John Carter' equivalent of Uggie, and the movie, sad to say, needs him.
2128	All I know is, the end couldn't come fast enough.
2129	Foster's cobalt-blue eyes and pale, pointy features have rarely been used to such ambiguous effect. Is she the hardest or the most hurt-looking woman you've ever seen?
2130	It continually finds some added depth and shading to its familiar setup and it's hard to not appreciate a movie that's content to be a solid, unpretentious genre entry, especially for a first outing.
2131	Great music video...but doesn't cut it as a movie.
2132	Ghosts of the Abyss is a beautifully rendered middle-of-the-road documentary that strikes a perfect balance between entertainment and education.
2133	The pieces fit together easily, too easily, in fact, which sets you up for the grand finale.
2134	A badly disfigured hero and a cliched heart of gold heroine are wrapped up in an inane plot. It makes you wonder just why did they make this movie?
2135	On its own terms, Resident Evil updates the zombie genre with an anti-corporate message while still scaring its audience and providing heart-pounding action.
2136	It's in the grand tradition of the classic Hollywood cartoons in that it provides entertainment for all ages, even if you end up laughing at different things.
2137	Good performances save this from being a lame hagiography. Just.
2138	In this specific role, Ryan does not have the cohones to do the physical strut that the real Kallen used to succeed.
2139	A simply breathtaking work of art with a very human, intensely cinematic heart.
2140	Paris Can Wait may be a terrific vicarious vacation, but it's an airless cinematic excursion.
2141	A jejune actioner that has pretensions of making a political statement about such things as drugs, smuggling and illegals.
2142	It's not sharp or funny or scabrous enough to work as a dark comedy and it leaves an uncomfortable taste, in part because Barker never actually broke a story of profound significance. She was the story.
2143	The film does contain a few moments of real terror, and Watts demonstrates at least a smidgen of the genius she showed in last year's Mulholland Drive.
2144	The gap between touchy-feely and touching isn't easy to span, so credit judicious pruning on the one hand and a beefed-up script on the other for getting perhaps the best possible movie out of Robert James Waller's The Bridges of Madison County.
2145	Bill Murray's performance in Rock the Kasbah is akin to a man throwing life preservers and lowering lifeboats aboard a quickly sinking ship.
2146	An entertaining kinky kick of a movie, a lightweight delight about dreamers and dilettantes.
2147	Selma asks for so little, complains so seldom, and is in such perpetual denial about her problems that I find her virtually indigestible as a character.
2148	Virtually every aspect of Pieces is inept, aside from moments of gore - which are admittedly quite spectacular.
2149	...a frustrating and maddeningly confounding piece of work...
2150	It's an amusing feature but also emotionally resonant and expertly performed.
2151	It's not really a cynical or outrageous point of view, but just a really lazy one, and offensively, exploitatively so.
2152	Tim Burton's masterpiece
2153	Maudlin make-believe in which a molecule of fact has been dropped like vermouth into a martini ...
2154	"Hancock"" is not a bad movie, just an underachieving one. It lacks a ""wow"" factor. It is bland and routine and flies off in too many directions."
2155	An exquisite combination of sound and vision.
2156	The film moves in frustrating herks and jerks. What works is the combustible teaming of Natalie Portman and Scarlett Johansson, who give the Boleyn hotties a tough core of intelligence and wit.
2157	...Subtle, quiet, and deeply enigmatic, like a disturbing dream.
2158	Flimsy but fun, this rom-com has an enjoyable edge to it -- just don't expect to remember much about it in the morning.
2159	Project Nim will be considered amongst the best docs of the year and another brilliant piece of work from Marsh.
2160	Its power may owe more to Beethoven and Bach than the skills of the filmmakers, but it can be recommended to all who like a strange and moving story.
2161	A stellar documentary...
2162	"The film lost me at ""hallo""."
2163	Filmmaker Todd Phillips deserves credit for having the stomach to have spent enough time with Allin to make this documentary.
2164	A sporadically funny comedy about a crisis in the relationship of a smiley couple who seem to think that life should be an endless run of happy days.
2165	Waking up in the aftermath of a meth-lab explosion might be less disorienting than watching this. And if you think there's no room for more, Neveldine/Taylor are probably a weekend and a bag of crack-filled Pixie Stix away from proving you wrong.
2166	There isn't a performance in this film that isn't exquisitely in key or a frame in this film that doesn't feel right. At times, the movie deliberately leaves us grasping to understand what we've seen.
2167	A car wreck at the intersection of Woody Allen and Kaufman.
2168	"Love, Rosie"" doesn't aspire to be anything more than a digestible rom-com trifle. It's a sweet movie about sweet people who are always sweet to each other and it's enough to make one sick on the saccharine."
2169	Wholly divine.
2170	It's so amped up that High Voltage suffers its own energy shortage well before the finale. It's also every bit as stupid as it sounds.
2171	"A Private War"" doesn't ask you to understand the politics of war, only the human side. And it shows the toll war takes on people's souls, most of which it never gives back."
2172	If you think about it long enough, you'll realize that the movie is asking you to root for a disturbed sociopath who ruins people's lives for sport. Are we having fun yet?
2173	A meager one-joke comedy peopled by stereotypes.
2174	As the genre goes, this is a superior offering. It gives the first clear evidence that the doe-eyed Seyfried can really act; it soothes the eyes with luscious views of beautiful Tuscany in all its moods...
2175	This is what Selma dares to do so well: show us the small, private moments in King's life, the intimacies, the humanity.
2176	...a breezy, consistently engaging piece of work.
2177	I went into a trance watching it - and haven't quite surfaced, even now.
2178	Goodbye Lover is not so much a story as some kind of a board game, with too many pieces and not enough rules.
2179	A sequel that, whatever its actual motivation, doesn't feel like a studio-mandated cash grab, but an organic continuation of the original, both in content and style.
2180	Payne's road movie emphasizes sincerity more than thrills. But its stark beauty and earnest characters provide a memorable excursion.
2181	Inherent Vice, brilliantly scored by Jonny Greenwood, is an Anderson head trip, impure jazz with a reverb that can leave you dazed, confused and even annoyed. But at no time do you doubt that you are in the hands of a master. 
2182	Very entertaining war movie with just the right touch of Vietnam-era cynicism
2183	[Solid] performances took me over some of the bumps of the movie.
2184	This is a lying movie full of lies. The first lie is that the mere presence of Cook is automatically funny.
2185	A modern classic about the folly of violence.
2186	An unlikely but likable comedy, bigger on sweetness than it is on belly laughs.
2187	As for Goldberg herself, there is similarly little for her to do, and she looks bored.
2188	A pedestrian film by a hack director that is still worth seeing for the fascination of its subject matter.
2189	Despite a star-studded cast and healthy helpings of sentiment, nostalgia and heart, it's a hollow affair that's content to tell the viewer how to feel rather than earning those feelings through its story and performances.
2190	The whole exercise feels predictable and programmed.
2191	A bloody, gruesome black comedy that's not for kids.
2192	Instead of a highly relevant political satire, writer-director Barry Levinson takes the easy way out and churns a paint-by-numbers tale of corporate malfeasance. Guess he had no special interests in creating a smart, savvy comedy.
2193	Ernest did much better in some of the follow-ups.
2194	Ross has come up with one of the best, most subversive, and definitely one of the most memorable films of the year.
2195	Throughout, the fragility of the native cultures and of the rain-forest environment that is their home is underscored by Guerra in this fascinating, melancholy movie.
2196	I'm not sure why anyone that isn't a diehard fan of the series would bother wasting their time with X. You'd be just as well off renting one of the older titles, because they're all pretty much the same movie.
2197	Best of Youth has the textures and depth of characterization of a great novel.
2198	'Superbad' and 'Knocked Up' got the delicate balance just right for this kind of raunchfest. 'Chuck' apparently didn't get the memo.
2199	Despite strong performances, this is ultimately a disappointing drama thanks to its emotionally closed-off characters, and a plodding script that can't quite escape its stagebound origins and never quite sparks to life.
2200	The finale may raise eyebrows, but this is an experience you'll want to relive.
2201	Sit back and enjoy the Matthau.
2202	American Violet is a justice story, with some honest justice. It's nicely reassuring that it happens to be true.
2203	Swept me along with its narrative, making me forget for a while that we would eventually make it out alive.
2204	Few filmmakers are more assured or alluring, even when we fear we're following a monster.
2205	Sayles' love of and respect for the culture, and his willingness-or eagerness-to leave the viewer with more questions than answers makes Casa de los Babys superlative.
2206	Intriguing, then, mainly for historical and comparison purposes.
2207	At long last, a spaghetti Western for the kiddie set -- and one that doesn't sell older viewers short.
2208	Extremely uneven, with a very artificial third act. However, Bill Murray's performance and some good bits in the first half make it ultimately worth checking-out. 
2209	It's a film that deftly, intelligently avoids all the typical Oscar-mongering guck, sidestepping all the predictable elements at nearly every turn.
2210	... an odd mix of coming of age film and an animated Babe where bulls wag exaggerated udders along with their feminine counterparts.
2211	...a powerful piece of entertaining filmmaking.
2212	A well-made but excruciatingly unpleasant adaptation.
2213	It all ends with a mystery over the new identity of the killer, which is so hard to figure out that you'd have to be at least six years old.
2214	The franchise squeaks past with a so-so sequel that barely improves on what came before. Our only hope is that at some point they'll have to hibernate.
2215	An enjoyable and humorous Hopkins and another wonderful performance from Mirren make this film quietly watchable.
2216	Will eventually be remembered as one of Eastwood's best films of this period of his remarkable career. 
2217	Stallone tem um de seus melhores momentos, desde 'Rocky', neste filme.
2218	A lot of it is painfully unfunny, but often for bizarre if not entertaining reasons.
2219	What it lacks in originality and creativity it makes up for with action and a talented cast that breathes life into its thinly drawn characters.
2220	The movie is surprisingly nimble and emotionally honest.
2221	Whatever its limitations, Cop Land has talent to burn.
2222	Matt Damon proves he's more than up to the task as an action star.
2223	[T]he film really finds its stride as an examination of passionate people fighting tooth-and-nail for their artistic satisfaction.
2224	The Savages is terrific -- a movie of uncommon appreciation for the nature and nurture that go into making us who we are, a perfectly calibrated drama both compassionate and unsentimental.
2225	You feel trapped with these people who have allowed their lives to become mundane hells and for some reason are forcing you to share it with them.
2226	The literal Benjamin Button that Fincher and Pitt have created with special effects is bland and passive even in the years when you'd think a reverse-ager would be most conflicted, fatalistic, or wise.
2227	Rourke and Willimon have crafted a juicy, darkly compelling drama that offers a sleek alternative to what's come before. It's hardly revolutionary or particularly revisionist but there's enough here to make it feel like a worthy endeavour nonetheless.
2228	"From the producers of ""Stranger Things"" and ""Arrival,"" this ain't any of those."
2229	This would be infinitely more likeable if it wasn't for some irritatingly unreal plot development.
2230	If nothing else, Identity Thief confirms McCarthy's identity in the Hollywood hierarchy: She's a big, ballsy star.
2231	Paramount has little faith in this supernatural fright film...and with good reason
2232	Someone has to save us from Lawrence's onslaught of cinematic dross.
2233	Bryan Singer makes this movie possible, filled with great suspense and amazing actors. This film is on my short list as one of the year's best.
2234	I can't name an actor who could have made young Lecter as interesting as the older one, but Ulliel does not come close.
2235	[Craig Brewer] proves he can control atmosphere with the best of them.
2236	"The story let me down from time to time; it's when we get to see the master work at his craft that ""Hitchcock"" delivers the most."
2237	Joe Roth steps back into the director's chair after nearly a decade and AMERICA'S SWEETHEARTS suffers the same diffused focus that his earlier efforts. After the tightly-paced opening, the film flounders until all the major players have been introduced.
2238	This electrifying film puts the tension, the fear, the courage, and the tragedy in perspective, and dramatizes it through the struggles of people, not rhetoric.
2239	It's all very spirited without getting anywhere near the spirit of Austen herself -- at least as we know her from her work.
2240	This isn't just a second helping of Gaylord Focker humiliation, for once here's a comedy sequel that manages to revisit its world without banally repeating it.
2241	Expendables is the closest thing to movie Viagra yet invented. It's reprehensible. It's stoopid violent. It's a lot of unholy fun.
2242	A throwback to all that made movies like this exciting in the first place, a film where the action, though highly alluring, remains less important than the mystery at hand.
2243	[Spade's] snide bits provide some of the picture's funniest stuff. But that's only because little else in the movie does.
2244	This sequel seems afraid of confusing people, so much so that it dumbs down the plot to an insulting level.
2245	When Hill and Moore leave story and characters behind to veer off into suspenseless chases through cornfields, one wonders if the era of earnest American drama may be coming to a close.
2246	This is no The Day of the Jackal. It's functional. Respectful rather than inspired. It won't damage Cruise's reputation, but it won't enhance it in any degree either.
2247	With plenty of betrayal, attempted incest and beheadings crammed into this period episode of The Young and the Restless, The Other Boleyn Sister has appeal in an otherwise stiff genre.
2248	There are some terrific performances. Scottish TV star Compston makes Liam quite sympathetic; despite his character's many failings, you want the best for him and his family.
2249	"The underlying story here is powerful enough that it sells itself. The best thing about ""The Miracle Season"" is it lets that story unfold and doesn't do anything to stand in its way."
2250	What begins as an apparently simple tale of sibling interaction reveals a complex web of pain, guilt, and uncertainty.
2251	You may not believe in the events that transpire in The Passion of the Christ, but it's hard to deny the grim potency with which they've been captured.
2252	Low IQs plague otherwise funny Wilson vehicle ...
2253	To work through the many layers of exposition that The Last Witch Hunter unloads would take longer than this review has to get to why the film isn't very good.
2254	A clear and unequivocal improvement over the reprehensible Quantum of Solace...
2255	This is Disney animation at its best: a witty and swashbuckling tale of adventure.
2256	It captures a lot of what's so enjoyable about the mobile app, which is really all it needs to do.
2257	"Fight Club"" is a cinematic Hail-Mary pass from David Fincher that the audience desperately wants to catch."
2258	Galaxy Quest works not just as a parody or a send-up of a type of film. It works as a basic space adventure as well.
2259	A bafflingly misguided experiment.
2260	... As stale and formulaic as it gets.
2261	Though this pastiche has been crafted by film nerds and largely for them, Michel Hazanavicius' feature has an emotional generosity that speaks louder than words.
2262	Leaves you wondering why nobody involved with this film seems to have ever met an actual working mother.
2263	Unlikely as it may be, the relationship begins to seem as plausible to us as to the willfully optimistic Doris, which is a testament to the performers transcending the script's default mode of condescension.
2264	A shrewd, observant ensemble comedy-drama...A little film that cannily melds edgy satire with a degree of warmth and even a touch of profundity.
2265	Hard to think of a more mystifying mismatch of filmmaker and material.
2266	"Roman Coppola's directorial debut ""CQ"" is a treat. A fluffy delight."
2267	You've seen this movie before. Here it is again.
2268	An unfathomably awful film that will undoubtedly be a smash hit.
2269	For those who acutely empathize with the ravages of grief, Shults has delivered a film more horrific than any boogeyman or ghoul in recent memory.
2270	However embarrassed you might feel in the morning, this in an enjoyable movie with an entertaining angle on a hard-to-resist period of history.
2271	[McAvoy] and Hathaway simply aren't given much to do together, and they have two long hours to do it in. Screenwriters Kevin Hood and Sarah Williams seem reluctant to risk the ire of Austenites.
2272	Arresting, ambitious and a bit of an acquired taste, Cahill's extraordinary second feature bursts with big, bold ideas.
2273	The best reason to see this documentary is for the stunning shots of polar bears and walruses in the Arctic Circle. If the filmmakers had just left it at that, they would have accomplished a lot.
2274	If you're in the mood for the cinematic equivalent of sugar and trans fats, the film delivers with one physics-defying set piece after another.
2275	Truly disappointing sequel to Rocky Horror
2276	It looks like these performers are genuinely enjoying themselves, and it's infectious. Despite the preposterous escapades and the self-destructive satire, at the end of it all, there's something real left standing.
2277	No Country for Old Men is the brothers at their most polished, austere, and humorless.
2278	No one, but no one does crime like Michael Mann.
2279	The third in director Yoji Yamada's Samurai Trilogy is an enjoyable, well acted drama, with a superb climactic swordfight and a plot that seems to have been lifted straight out of Hollywood melodrama.
2280	...a formula stirring in upscale sex, murder, holiday mutilation and lots of junior high school revenge fantasy.
2281	An impeccably made classic Japanese period picture in which a nobility of spirit is tested amid the most beautiful of settings, revealing the harshness and hypocrisy of a feudal society of the utmost formality and rigidity.
2282	Given its drastically contrived nature, the script gets further than I expected.
2283	Ultimately, none of this comes together in any coherent way, truly leaving audiences with an experience that lives and dies based on the craft of bloodshed and gore
2284	Norman Jewison's mind-numbingly literal adaptation of the stage musical Fiddler on the Roof is no disaster, but it certainly has its limitations.
2285	...Paints a bleak picture of humanity. Not to mention, shall we say, animality.
2286	For all its visual fizz, Bonello's film tells us nothing about the designer, save the usual pompous/concessive hero-worship.
2287	That the events really happened offers no excuse for the button-pushing, by-the-numbers approach taken by Beresford and screenwriter Paul Pender.
2288	Beautifully designed and impressively directed, this is a thoroughly enjoyable, emotionally engaging space opera with an intelligent script, strong characters, terrific special effects and superb performances from Taylor Kitsch and Lynn Collins.
2289	David O. Russell's I Heart Huckabees is content to wallow in obscurantist quirk and flash.
2290	Has such anti-Semitic possibilities and no upside for anyone but believers in Mel's vision that the execution of Christ is more important than his life.
2291	The Other Boleyn Girl is the Tudors as a romantic, sexy soap opera. With its beautiful young cast, this adaptation of Philippa Gregory's best-selling potboiler is delicious fun.
2292	A failed attempt at an Alfred Hitchcock suspense thriller.
2293	Isn't completely satisfying, but its larger-than-life ambitions earn it a recommendation.
2294	Even by the thoroughly undemanding standards of its burned-out genre, Valentine is vacuous, tedious, and perfunctory.
2295	The effects are poor, the dialogue is laughable, and despite Aaron Eckhart's valiant efforts, the whole thing feels like a cheesy TV movie.
2296	Dry and dawdling, haphazardly structured, and grindingly obvious.
2297	Depp runs wild with eccentric behaviour. Yet, with his technical proficiency equal to his eccentric decision-making, Depp makes every choice seem appropriate or even absolutely essential to the character.
2298	The film's plot rarely makes sense and the script is lackluster, but who cares when each chase is composed of the right amount of speed and clarity? Lin never puts his foot on the break until the last possible second.
2299	Disney's animated pirate tale has masterful visuals -- and an amateur's script.
2300	Silly yet never quite satirical, it's like Shrek without his teeth.
2301	"Rodney [Dangerfield] may have cracked about ""praying after you eat,"" but this film reflects the need to surfeit before finding balance."
2302	Contrary to the lessons we learned in Werner Herzog's Grizzly Man, large bears will not always eat irritating hippie man-children. Damn shame.
2303	Mondays in the Sun is heartfelt and true and as tedious as a movie about chronic unemployment can be.
2304	Maybe it's a familiar formula, but it works on multiple levels. [Full Review in Spanish] 
2305	Like mother, like daughter: Ice queens and overachievers
2306	Writer-directors Mark Neveldine and Brian Taylor have written their own set of action-comedy challenges, and they slam-dunk pretty much every one.
2307	Mostly you spy the red flags that shout Troubled Production and We Don't Know What to Do With This Script.
2308	Rife with a pervasive sense of loss, Tokyo story offers little comfort and promises great sorrow. This is a profoundly moving film.
2309	As the film teeters the line between ridiculous and generic screwball, the all-star cast dazzles to hilarious effect. 
2310	Despite its title, it's too soft and squishy for comfort, and while it can't be counted a strike-out on the cinematic scoreboard, it's at best a weak single.
2311	Waist Deep is unapologetically a B movie, its narrative premise placed carefully on the borderline between the wildly implausible and the completely absurd.
2312	I'm pleased to report that Shanghai Noon is the best Jackie Chan movie in many moons.
2313	Diesel fails to convince in his role. His delivery is mostly flat and rarely do any of the one-liners hit their mark. It's a story of sorcery seriously lacking in cinematic magic.
2314	An unusually realistic teen movie, this drama gets deep under the skin of its characters, breathing new life into the genre.
2315	Despite the participation of selective, talented actress Jodie Foster and a screenplay that borrows heavily from The Lady Vanishes, Flightplan can't avoid falling apart during its final half-hour.
2316	A comedy that is simultaneously too broad and luke-warm.
2317	"Its wit is played at the expense of unexpected targets... still, ""Team America"" is a descent into truly offensive, hysterical satire."
2318	Um thriller de espionagem feito por e para adultos.
2319	With its narrative slight and familiar, and its sense of drama and threat muted, it relies upon its roster of recognisable properties - and the affection everyone has for them, especially off-screen - to provide interest.
2320	Memoirs brandishes old-school razzle dazzle at the expense of subtlety and contemplation, coating his sound stage sets in delicately applied layers of cherry blossoms and snowflakes.
2321	The life at the movie's center speaks to what an artist sometimes gives up for art. If only we experienced that sacrifice, that turmoil, more vividly.
2322	Frequent flashbacks, equal parts soap opera and historical fashion show, explicate the complicated relationships between Kell, Faith and the MacLeods.
2323	Swims in mediocrity, sticking its head up for a breath of fresh air now and then.
2324	Could be this summer's sleeper, or this summer's The Iron Giant.
2325	Even an uneven Sayles film is superior to most such Hollywood dramas.
2326	This might well be worth a rental for the kids when it comes out on video, but it's a bit too literary despite the wonderful cinematography.
2327	Radio isn't as bad as one might imagine, but it's not good, either. It's... okay.
2328	The light breaking through yonder window is the glare of critical scrutiny - and Letters to Juliet looks pathetic in it. 
2329	This thoughtful movie ... raises an issue any of us might face.
2330	It'd be easy to write off Paramount's Tupac: Resurrection as a cheap publicity stunt.
2331	"Hitchcock once said ""Drama is life with the dull parts left out"", ironic then that this Hitchcock movie is a stuffy succession of extremely dull scenes."
2332	This is Bond as interpreted by the British director Sam Mendes and shot by the renowned cinematographer Roger Deakins, and one of the first things that strike you is how sumptuous it looks.
2333	While the film breaks no new ground, it offers the kind of simple, well-crafted, family entertainment that used to be a staple of the Disney studio.
2334	Fincher is perfectly suited to the material, with its voluminous clues to be organized and parsed, its emotional austerity, and its serial murder, rape, and sundry sick plot twists.
2335	There is a critical void in the middle--the villain.
2336	Although it's very good at showing Jesus' suffering, the movie treats him as a prop
2337	This is chew-your-fingernails country. Anyone who misses it simply because it stars a couch-jumping Scientologist is missing a great film.
2338	"Dragon Blade"" is a solidly constructed epic that, despite its many battle scenes, has a strong message of pacifism and unity."
2339	Hammer is exceptionally fine in the film... while Chalamet is perfect as the indecisive youth who is drawn to this exotic stranger in ways he himself can't fully comprehend.
2340	There are a few genuinely exciting moments, but they peter out as the film progresses and the movie stumbles into increasingly implausible territory.
2341	It's better to think of David Cronenberg's Cosmopolis as a dream than a movie. 
2342	Like its characters, this drama plods along but its compelling plot makes it worth seeing.
2343	It is a broody psychological Western, a lot of peering out into endless prairie landscapes, as much Ingmar Bergman as John Ford, with a little bit of Heathcliff thrown in.
2344	Undeniably the big misfire of the season. Good looking locations, and sexy stars don't make up for a lack of chemistry, and a tepid plot.
2345	Flightplan is like airplane food. No matter how good the ingredients the air chef has to work with, the entree inevitably ends up tasting like a Xerox of a facsimile of a meal.
2346	Can hold its head very high in [the] company [of] ... Clueless, Mean Girls and Juno ... A total home run as a first feature for writer/director/producer Kelly Fremon Craig, it's consistently funny, moving and emotionally honest.
2347	The dedicated fairy tale fan will have tons of fun spotting all the references. Adams, meanwhile, gives one of the comedy performances of the year.
2348	This touching rise-and-fall story has already bagged a host of awards and seems on track for Oscar attention.
2349	During its rocky road to becoming a fractured love story, Silver Linings Playbook and its great ensemble cast run a funny, conflict-mined, even suspenseful path. It's a total winner.
2350	It has heart and intelligence to offset its more raucous moments and looks destined for cult appeal.
2351	The music in the film is terrific -- searing, gut-twisting wails of loss and despair...But The portrayal of Rae 's compulsive need for sex and of her always-perfect, always exposed little body is exploitive, more trashy than steamy.
2352	Mamet has always been concerned with primal masculinity...The test of these men is twofold: can they survive the wilderness, and can they survive each other? [Blu-ray]
2353	The sentiment is balanced with cheeky Irish humor, Pierce Brosnan is fine as Desmond, and there's a sobering sense of history.
2354	It is the audience who will feel cursed.
2355	The action sequences are decent, but the effects end up so god-awful towards the end ... that all you can do is cringe.
2356	David Fincher's Hollywood take on the Stieg Larsson bestseller is a sleek yet somehow soulless adaptation.
2357	This is a thriller, an education in stage magic, a mystery, and even a bit of a science fiction film.
2358	Warts and all, The Artist reminds us that the fire is far from extinguished.
2359	I liked individual moments in The Good Girl, but it takes an illogical approach to its storyline.
2360	A dull, somnambulant exercise in pretension whose pervasive quiet is broken by frequent outbursts of violence and noise.
2361	It's hard not to watch this explosive power punch of a movie and not love absolutely every frame. 
2362	Subtly realized and finely nuanced, this is fresh and unspoiled filmmaking.
2363	The movie survives its sizable flaws thanks to a lot of heart and winning performances by its lead actors.
2364	Not completely successful, but enjoyable enough
2365	One Small Hitch should have settled on being a cute but insipid romantic comedy. By emphasizing a lead character who does nothing more than play into a wedding fantasy in hopes that a frog will turn into her prince is ultimately more tragic than comic.
2366	Seyfried almost makes up for Dear John as the everygirl heroine who wants to be Julia Roberts for the iPod generation.
2367	An astonishing drama of sexual awakening that explores the exhilarations and anxieties that accompany first love.
2368	There's nothing wrong with tipping one's cap to one's influences, but in no case does this loud, crude and derivative film ever raise the bar. In fact, it actually lowers it.
2369	...stale and predictable.
2370	Zombie works the camera well and his music talents allow for a good use of the hard rock score, but ultimately despite all the visual trickery there's a lack of atmosphere, tension and even shock.
2371	Ang Lee's attempt to put the Swinging Sixties on the screen with love, respect and a dash of humour is a distinct disappointment.
2372	Stephen Rea, Aidan Quinn, and Alan Bates play Desmond's legal eagles, and when joined by Brosnan, the sight of this grandiloquent quartet lolling in pretty Irish settings is a pleasant enough thing, 'tis.
2373	It's all confusing, woozy and slightly stoned, and feels very much like adolescence.
2374	Despite an interesting turn by Guy Pearce as Andy Warhol, the movie fails to deliver any character that I could care about.
2375	Why didn't Kimberly Peirce rescue this movie?
2376	Eastwood can't overcome the inherent problem that everyday Joes like split-second heroes Spencer Stone, Alek Skarlatos and Anthony Sadler don't necessarily have cinematic back-stories.
2377	The film is a mess.
2378	[Sedgwick] mostly just seems like an irresponsible girl without any real dreams, who blew all her money and only wound up in rehab when she couldn't pay her rent anymore.
2379	Ben Stiller, an excellent comic actor, does some of his best work here, matched up with one of the all-time greats, Robert De Niro.
2380	By erasing all the mystery from Lecter's past, Harris and director Webber have also stripped him of his ability to terrify, and their film, though gory and violent enough, is almost entirely devoid of shock or suspense.
2381	... the greatest superhero film ever.
2382	...heightened by a rare cinematic artistry that seamlessly melds a probing character essay with a lyrical Western epic.
2383	Reviled on release, who would have thought that Ridley Scott's sci-fi noir would go on to become so influential and retrospectively acclaimed?
2384	A fun little Bond flick
2385	I wouldn't call the movie a dog, but I didn't love it either. Our search for the next Great Romantic Comedy, like so many Hollywood singletons' quest for love, continues.
2386	The MVP here is Chris Galletta's script, which is as knowing of teen emotions as it is acidly funny.
2387	It's hard to cheer for a film that wears a slight sneer when it comes to its leading lady.
2388	Intelligent, superbly acted and finely observed, but Jindabyne suffers from too many extraneous elements and from a story that doesn't land with enough force or purpose.
2389	It drips with class and craftsmanship, but the magic is not there
2390	All very well, but it is by no means the giddy delight that the fans hoped for.
2391	this puts Cuba back into the Oscar race again, he's charming and wonderful -- although he plays a slow guy, which is surefire Oscar fodder
2392	Displaying a storytelling confidence unseen in most genre pictures, The Ring succeeds in being the most terrifying film to hit theaters since The Blair Witch Project.
2393	American Hustle is Saturday Night Bluster.
2394	The film's darker elements are brushed aside and we're left with a zany, feel-good finale.
2395	an impressively steamy story for its day with some moments of true greatness
2396	By the end, we know these characters so well that just seeing any two of them meet draws tears
2397	There are times when it does something new with the genre - and it does make you care about the protagonists.
2398	As a Gen-X member, I will be flogged for saying so, but this movie sucked.
2399	The film is really no more than a two-hour prelude to a climax in which our hero ... rhythmically tells people off.
2400	It might not make wads of cash, but Wonderland will definitely get a rise out of audiences.
2401	Watching Anderson try to be funny is like getting a tooth pulled, or sitting through a Tim Burton DVD audio commentary.
2402	A marvelous comedy-drama, brimming with wit, style, and sophistication.
2403	The murder-mystery plot is told in rough-and-tumble style, full of sound and fury but signifying almost nothing in the end.
2404	Gripping, captivating and electrifying. Bryan Cranston gives one of the best performances of his career.
2405	Even the most avid action junkies would have a hard time not rolling their eyes at the blandness of it all.
2406	There's possibly nothing sadder in the world of cinema than a comedy trying this hard for laughs.
2407	Rodrigo Garcia knew he was making a good movie, but did he really understand the kind of good movie he was making?
2408	Down to the Bone emerges with an aura of authenticity so strong as to be mesmerizing, thanks to a superior script brought to life with infallibly natural performances ...
2409	A frivolous but funny comedy with great special effects and admirable performances. This should become a lasting classic, even for people who don't watch Star Trek, which it so cleverly spoofs.
2410	Difret is heavy-handed cinema and conflicted advocacy for a cause that deserves better.
2411	Billy Elliot has 'movie magic,' that ineffable cinematic sparkle which leaves the audience with a touch more forbearance than they had when they entered the theater.
2412	Daniel Craig and Rooney Mara are fine in the leads, but when it comes to the actual plot, one does get the feeling that it didn't need to be told again. Newcomers to the story may disagree.
2413	"The worst things about Basic Instinct, though, are the explicit ""love"" scenes. They're supposed to contribute to a heady equation in which sex, violence and psychology are fused; instead, they're gratuitous, exploitative, and entirely unerotic."
2414	Belief does need to be suspended to buy into The Ring's story, but once you've done that, you're in for a great ride.
2415	There's nothing broken about The Break-Up, which turns rom-com conventions on their side in free-wheeling fashion, and in doing so colorfully, wittily celebrates what it is about men and women that both attract one another and drives us crazy.
2416	There is a God in the film, and it pursues Jesus throughout.
2417	Passably funny star vehicle. Nothing great.
2418	These people are not easy to love, but they are fascinating to watch.
2419	Louis Malle's brilliant feature directorial debut is a stylish film noir, boasting great jazz score and impressive performance from the young Jeanne Moreau.
2420	"Billion Dollar Movie"" is proof positive that having friends is a lot more important than having talent in Hollywood. "
2421	Clunkily earthbound as its characters and the situations plod forward while never getting anywhere.
2422	Eminem kept his cool, and his new movie was straight dope.
2423	The result is often spellbinding, and to mention some of the sights we see is to praise the film's ambition.
2424	An exciting and scary final act makes up for a middling kid horror fantasy that is marked by a slow start and an inappropriately comedic tone.
2425	American Dreamz struggles so mightily to be clever it forgets to be competent.
2426	As a religious experience, The Passion of the Christ makes a damn fine movie.
2427	Well presented and brimming over with reverence, Beresford's tribute to an ex-Communist Billy Elliot sidesteps hard hits for a solid performance.
2428	Unfolds as a series of intriguing contrasts: between life and death, male and female, tradition and modernity, science and voodoo.
2429	The Last Witch Hunter starts off with traces of sly humour, but gradually collapses into a unwieldy combination of special effects confrontations and ponderous exposition.
2430	The vicious mirth is hit-or-miss but contagious.
2431	Please ground all future Airport movies. The first was fine, and enough.
2432	An off-key dismantling of what made the concept work in the first place.
2433	Italian-born director Erik Gandini's damning mess of a documentary purports to reveal that Italy is TV- and celebrity-besotted -- which is true but not new.
2434	Ever go on a vacation where most of the people around seem to be having more fun than you? Then you already know what it'll feel like to visit Couples Retreat.
2435	Shows you can pile on a lot of freight and still end up with a barge.
2436	A dumb, mean-spirited movie based on a dumb, mean-spirited video game.
2437	For all its intended depth and psychological realism, which at its best carries reminders of the work of Terrence Malick, there's a fake myth-making quality to it that, because of its inordinate length, could be mistaken for grandeur.
2438	Short Cuts lacks the sharp satire and excitement of The Player, but it's still a superior film.
2439	As entertaining today as it ever was, a classic to be treasured by all.
2440	Treasure Planet is just a reminder of how much I liked the original template from which all these cheap knockoffs have come.
2441	Whitaker has an amiable face that can tighten into a mask of steely determination in a heartbeat; I couldn't imagine another actor in the role.
2442	Weightless entertainment that's both camp and true.
2443	Flawed, but the action scenes are as violent, ridiculous and over the top as you could hope for.
2444	A cheesy attempt to throw everything at the screen, this futuristic thriller would no doubt work much better as a videogame
2445	Like the story of many broken down relationships: despite the initial attraction, you're left feeling cheated.
2446	What further elevates Deliver Us From Evil beyond the poignancy and courage of O'Grady's victims and the sorrow of their devastated families is Berg's access to the pedophile himself.
2447	Hello, My Name is Doris is indeed a good greeting for introduction, but as a sturdy and consistent character study it never quite gels although the always resourceful veteran Sally Field is a welcoming, timeless selling point.
2448	A marvelous coming-of-age comedy that should not be missed.
2449	A compelling, heartbreaking story of a human being -- one of many -- who was simply tired of being a nowhere man.
2450	The film encourages urine, fart, and booger humor, which reeks of nosepicker pandering, compounded by a message of personal worth that never comes through clearly enough.
2451	"Overall, ""The Light Between Oceans"" is a fine representation of the film-making potential of director Derek Cianfrance...although it won't be mentioned among his career highlights."
2452	...this is a movie of such emotional poignancy that the excessive length didn't bother me that much.
2453	The fake Disney-like sentimentality melts away into a movie of refreshing idealism, and occasional doses of sobering honesty.
2454	[A] thoughtful if somewhat scattered documentary ...
2455	The abrupt shift in Rock the Kasbah and the film's need to redeem its main character, particularly in such grand fashion, is a stumbling block which it simply cannot overcome.
2456	Anyone who thinks that Josh Hartnett isn't a true movie star should see his riveting, high-wire performance in August, a shrewdly dramatized look back at the bursting of the dot-com bubble.
2457	A heist comedy that reaffirms why Soderbergh belongs behind the movie camera.
2458	Touching and entertaining in equal measure.
2459	The film clearly and finally represents the mainstream success that has long eluded the Coens. Longtime fans, fear not: This is no sell-out. There is still plenty of what the Coens do best.
2460	Everybody involved in Breakin' All the Rules -- especially the audience -- deserves something more than this tedious excuse for a movie. 
2461	I don't know why [Close is] keen to play such a recessive wisp of a man, but I admire how committed she is to her bowler hat.
2462	The entire film is predicated on turgid slapstick bits that simply congratulate viewers for having seen a handful of recent studio blockbusters.
2463	The film has enough wild driving to satisfy any French Connection fan or Bullitt buff, but there's precious little for anyone else to enjoy.
2464	Just like Fellini's grand spectacles, La Grande Bellezza washes over you in series of scenes, visages, sensations and impressions, and although in this case it doesn't quite gel into a cohesive whole, it's nonetheless a journey worth taking...
2465	Spoofs such kiddie favourites as Fear And Loathing In Las Vegas, the mystical writings of Carlos Castaneda, and Sergio Leone's Dollars trilogy.
2466	"Probably the closest thing my generation will get to having its own ""Diner"
2467	There's not a lot to say about this film, it's enjoyable in a very predictable way.
2468	Scarily awful -- this spoof horror franchise needs a stake driven through its heart, and quick...
2469	It's a very sincere work, but it would be better as a diary or documentary.
2470	There are no great thunderbolts of emotion as in Koreeda's other work, but fans of the director's more heartrending movies may appreciate this buoyant palate cleanser.
2471	A stunning blend of sci-fi, psychological thriller, and dark comedy.
2472	The movie you were hoping to avoid.
2473	Must Love Dogs is the kind of film that benefits far too much from its very talented veteran cast.
2474	Prickly couple loses dog, rediscovers love in ho-hum drama.
2475	Rarely rises above the status of conventional thriller.
2476	The great Audrey Plaza is let down by weak material in this mirthless female-centric gross-out comedy.
2477	Paper Heart is increasingly focused on the tension between Cera and Yi's supposedly real romance and the camera's imposition of structure and self-consciousness.
2478	Despite hokum, bad plotting, stereotypical characters and mediocre acting, 'Dragon Blade' does deliver crowd-pleasing battles and gorgeous scenery.
2479	Stylistically, Blade Runner is the Citizen Kane of sci-fi movies.
2480	It's as bad as you would imagine, and yet it's as good as it could possibly be.
2481	Under the veneer of another fine/creepy Depp performance, the film falls flat.
2482	Sometimes a movie works because all of the ingredients come together so well. Failure to Launch is one of those movies. 
2483	"I Origins"" has a pleasing way of working expansive ideas into a suspenseful, twisting story line, even if it occasionally has to wrench the story around tight turns."
2484	McCarthy, who has been wackily funny in supporting parts, will be the revelation for most of us: Not only can she carry a lead, but she handles heartfelt moments of joy and sorrow.
2485	A beauty.
2486	It works as an intense meditation on faith, despair and evil.
2487	At least this impromptu beach 'fashion show' is more watchable than the rest of the movie, which eventually turns into an improbable adventure-thriller filled with groan-inducing dialogue and equally groan-inducing performances.
2488	Written with both heart and humor, it's an amazing hybrid of styles you would never think could work so well together.
2489	You know exactly what you are going to get, kinda like comfort food for your movie going soul.
2490	Mulroney is like a young Stallone - and he's got half the acting ability to prove it.
2491	A light-hearted comedy about the Vatican and the Papacy under pressure due to a surprising development.
2492	The raw, gritty, real stock footage just doesn't match with the spoof-like quality of the animated trial.
2493	There are ... images that are shocking and disturbing.
2494	Aniston has always done some of her best acting in reaction shots, and Vaughn is a gold mine to react against. 
2495	The premise is intriguing, and for a time it seems that the Date Doctor may indeed know things about women that most men in the movies are not allowed to know, but the third act goes on autopilot just when the Doctor should be in.
2496	OK, it is a little derivative, but the young actors are all very convincing and Robert Hoffman does some terrific physical comedy after his body is commandeered by the alien leader.
2497	Payne does not resort to sentimental hokum but offers a poignant portrait of aging with the burden of regret.
2498	Without the delicious Alba's bootylicious presence, the shallow Into the Blue would sink like a stone. 
2499	This may be Knightley's first truly mature performance. Too bad it arrives wrapped in doggerel.
2500	[Jindabyne] accomplished and impressive but if it has a frustration, it's that finally it is less than it seems.
2501	"When the Dawn of the Dead remake features a better chainsaw kill than your film with the words ""chainsaw"" and ""massacre"" in the title you know you've made a stinker."
2502	A pointless spectacle that champions free-thinking intellectuals over violent zealots while ineffectually appealing to the same uncontrollable emotions it condemns.
2503	A good sequel and should please all the Potter fans who made the first film a blockbuster.
2504	...terminally uninvolving virtually from start to finish.
2505	Though Cary Grant manages to get the most he can from the role, it's not enough to cover up the film's emptiness.
2506	Beneath the thundering horse hoofs and happy wedding fiddles is a viper's nest of sexual intrigue that would be at home on Desperate Housewives.
2507	A gentle and sweet whimsy.
2508	It's not accurate history and doesn't have enough funny lines or bits to hold most adults' interest.
2509	There's a lot of coming and going in 'John Carter,' and most of the time I wasn't exactly sure where they're coming from or going to. 
2510	The psychobabble sympathy card doesn't play well here.
2511	Here is the biggest, fattest, dampest squib of the week: perhaps the most disappointing film ever to have won the Golden Bear at the Berlin film festival.
2512	LaBute ensures that the two worlds cross imaginatively and that other actors - even when not on screen all the time - have full roles too.
2513	Even if the warts in the portrait are reduced to mere blemishes, it provides as full a picture of a gifted artist as can be expected of an authorized biography.
2514	[Hoffman] scales his performance to Olympian heights, yet he elevates all his collaborators, too.
2515	I know Sausage Party is not made for kids, but they don't have to try so hard to prove it.
2516	The movie doesn't really work. The script is all too faithful to Fountain's florid brand of not-quite-human poetry. The thesis lines thud into place.
2517	As generic a horror movie as you're ever likely to find.
2518	A bunch of strange, vague ideas crammed into a movie with nowhere to go and absolutely nothing to show us.
2519	As you'd imagine, no one with more than one X chromosome is welcome to this party.
2520	Put away the knives aimed at Cruise and just enjoy the solid work he keeps putting out.
2521	"The Green Hornet"" has enough kicks and verve to keep the winter blues at bay, at least for a little while."
2522	Palo Alto doesn't hit you over the head with hipness. It sidles up to you, gets whispery close, then sidles away again, leaving behind an enveloping vapor that lingers for a sweet long time.
2523	Inherent Vice only skirts greatness instead of fully embracing it.
2524	Still Oscar-less, Ryan obviously sees Jackie as her blue-collar scrapper in the Brockovich-Norma Rae mold. What she delivers is very different -- an unwittingly patronizing Great Blond Hope.
2525	Gallo has the start of a good story here, but he can't find an original way to explore it.
2526	[A] grandiose masterpiece.
2527	It's a stirring watch but it's telling that the performances, not the film itself, have captured the Academy's attention.
2528	A funny movie. Ha-ha funny sometimes, but more frequently amusing in a good-natured, make-you-smile way.
2529	I don't know why they did this.
2530	An outrageously gorgeous spectacle of balletic aggression.
2531	There's a reason this warm, stylish human comedy was a big hit all across the Continent: It conveys a new generation's conviction that borders no longer matter.
2532	what it loses in coherence and dexterity it gains in pure sensationalism, whether it be visual, verbal, or narrative
2533	The wired stuntwork treads a fine line between dramatic embellishment and obvious movie magic, while Mark Dacascos turns in a formidable villain in this decent action adventure.
2534	Taking a cue from The King's Speech, A Royal Night Out fashions diverting entertainment from a footnote from royal history. 
2535	"Liam Neeson is perfectly cast as the man known to his comrades as ""The Big Fellow,"" a charming ladies' man whose ruthless guerrilla tactics blended with altruism and a fervent love of country."
2536	What's Wilson doing in a Woody Allen movie about a B-list screenwriter who time-travels from the present to the Jazz Age? Disarming the audience with his wistful joie de vivre, that's what.
2537	A failed and problematic Oscar hopeful being dumped in theaters a week before the start of Hollywood's summer season.
2538	In visual fertility Treasure Planet rivals the top Japanese animations of recent vintage.
2539	Enchanted is rich in Disney iconography, the best recipient of which is Susan Sarandon as the wicked Queen. The film in general really benefits from a stellar production team that create the feeling of a classic Disney film in the real world.
2540	... ends the trilogy with so much blunder... [Full review in Spanish]
2541	It might not be the frosted lemon tart that's been advertised for months, but it is solid, satisfying fare -- flecked with humor, grounded in pain.
2542	Despite an admirable effort on the part of its creative team, this new technological thriller is at odds with itself from the very first moments.
2543	The film's strength is compelling character relationships and Whedon's trademark dialogue...
2544	This charming coming of age Australian film marks the debuts of two talented women: Director Gillian Armstrong and actress Judy Davis.
2545	It has this exploratory character that Shults showed in his first film, although, perhaps, the relationship with the background, with what he narrates, doesn't end with total cohesion. [Full review in Spanish]
2546	Every decision made here, from how the novel was refined to the controversial casting of Rooney Mara to one of the best technical teams of the year was the right one.
2547	Brings shining performances from everyone across the board especially Hailee Steinfeld and a brilliant breakthrough debut for writer/director Kelly Fremon Craig.
2548	What puts the fight in Fight Club is Fincher's visual wizardry.
2549	Max Payne starts out promising but eventually begins to unravel, only to end in an awful mess.
2550	A triumph for Anne Hathaway, who brings to the young Jane the same jittery wide-eyed intensity she displayed in The Devil Wears Prada along with a secure British accent. She and Mr. McAvoy inject a keen intelligence into the couple's verbal jousts.
2551	As an indictment of how people of privilege continue to exploit and abuse life's have-nots, the movie is devastating.
2552	Allen holds onto his vision of a Golden Age better than anyone else, even while readily acknowledging that it's just a grand illusion.
2553	A brilliant feature-length anime that's good enough to deserve mention in the same breath as Akira, Ghost in the Shell, and Spirited Away.
2554	Highly flawed but crudely funny.
2555	Michael Showalter is content to trade They Came Together's mischievous genre deconstructionism for cheap-shot indie quirk.
2556	While Bourne's ultimate identity is not as surprising as we might like, enough fun has been generated in the journey itself.
2557	Poorly made and just stupid.
2558	The background music is stunningly evocative. And there's a certain grace and charm with which the movie has been made.
2559	Working from a Cormac McCarthy novel that has the heedless, headlong force of an action movie screenplay, Joel and Ethan Coen have improved upon the original by giving it a visual lyricism to match McCarthy's verbal barrage.
2560	The current reigning top of the heap tribute to the human spirit.
2561	Mild amusement is about the best you can hope for, but Bolt never bores.
2562	The message - stay true to your roots - is solid, and [director] Lee gives his outstanding comic cast some sharp one-liners, but he undermines the effort with crass humor, mugging and slapstick.
2563	Finally, a breath of fresh air arrives in the stale summer of sequels.
2564	In the Trump era of fake news and journalist bashing , the timing could not be more urgent for this powerful true story of a courageous reporter on the front lines of the truth.
2565	"Potential audiences would be better entertained by reading all the reviews to see how many synonyms can be used for the word ""bad."" And it would be much cheaper, too."
2566	Eastwood seems to lose interest in the story as the film unfolds. And if the director doesn't care enough to make sure each take is in focus, why should we?
2567	A snare for all those lured to theaters by Connery's name, Zeta-Jones' beauty, and the false promise of an enjoyable caper film.
2568	"It's very interesting, amusing, with a few hiccups in pacing ...Should we wonder if he was a real vampire, or be amused by the ""what if?"
2569	Consistently plays like an adult movie in uncomfortably fitting family-friendly clothes.
2570	Mild humor as a son tries to connect with his aging father.
2571	Sanders' production design and Gordon's art direction take us into the belly of the beast with wood carved Gothic halls reminiscent of a rib cage and a rickety iron elevator that plunges into the bloody bowels of Allerdale Hall.
2572	I truly wanted to like the film. Unfortunately it is a huge letdown, an almost unbroken and utterly unsuccessful sequence of wrong choices.
2573	...bleakness juxtaposed with bemusement...
2574	There's no flash, no sizzle, no surprise. Just beefcake and cheesecake, served on a plastic plate.
2575	Identity Thief is low on laughs and has a number of plot problems but the comic performances from Bateman and McCarthy ensure that it stays watchable.
2576	Funny romantic comedy, lots of Elvis jokes, and a lighthearted Nicholas Cage.
2577	Whatever [Michod's] screenplay lacks in terms of explicit dialogue or narrative complexity, however, it makes up for in subtle, reflective details and sun-scorched tension.
2578	Gibson ... seems determined to prove that Jesus suffered more than anyone who has ever lived, a tiresomely literal argument at best, an exercise in sadomasochistic bullying at worst.
2579	What could have been a very dry and earnest film emerges, under the intelligent direction of Norwegian Morten Tyldum working from a screenplay by Graham Moore, as a gripping and still rather extraordinary story.
2580	With a running time that clocks in under two hours, The Cloverfield Paradox uses its duration efficiently, mixing thrills and heart into a cocktail that makes for an effectively surprising film. 
2581	Unlike the red balloon that Pooh follows through much of the running time, Marc Forster's film lacks lightness.
2582	It's way too disjointed to really say what the intent of the endeavor really was.
2583	Kaurismaki's originality makes his Man both extremely affecting and engaging.
2584	The future of Wristcutters as a cult favorite is less assured. Rather than benefiting from repeated viewings, the movie's charm is pretty much spent after the first half hour.
2585	A smart, well-made film that treads new ground in the relationship wilderness.
2586	Originality isn't Fast Five's goal so much as distillation; Lin's aim is to make the ultimate version of a Fast and the Furious film and the third time appears to be the charm for him as director. Fast Five is the best of the series.
2587	Team America is a hoot, and a technical achievement.
2588	While the tongue-in-cheek comedy plays a major role, there's also a warm, charming story here that makes the movie much more than simple satire.
2589	The To Do List ultimately proves a lazy, self-involved lover, too busy indulging its own fetishes and desires to tend to the viewers' needs or offer them much gratification.
2590	The movie has little ambition to the creation of its world and even less when it comes to the humor.
2591	Instead, all we get is a pithy mope session where the best the group can do is rag on current celebrities like Brad Pitt. In a scenario so ripe for comedy and pathos, this is the best Spade can come up with?
2592	It's an oddball movie about a bunch of oddballs.
2593	Merely one of the greatest comedies ever made.
2594	Sincere and movie - but not enough Denzel.
2595	A sensitive, slice-of-life, subtle drama depicting lonely people yearning to make an emotional connection.
2596	Just when the slasher genre had mercifully been left for dead, along comes this abysmally wasteful exercise to drain it of whatever life it has left.
2597	Its humor derives from the campers' toilet and digestive tract malfunctions - truly tedious, except, perhaps, for matinee moppets with indulgent parents.
2598	Brrrrrrrrrrrr... definitely the scariest movie that I've seen so far this year.
2599	Family film tackles grief with humor and deep empathy.
2600	Ultimately the film delivers such a weak payoff that it makes nearly everything that came before it seem rather pointless.
2601	a rare pleasure of unrequited love that never dips the poet's ink into the syrup of sentimentality, but rather allows its characters to invest passion from their gently articulated imaginations.
2602	Wildly ambitious, Eubank's sci-fi often hits the mark.
2603	Entertaining little exploitation flick
2604	Needs more crashes, fewer bodily fluids, and a shorter running time. while that first half is great, the thoroughly milked premise ultimately takes its toll, and the gross-out gags seem done more out of desperation
2605	Through a lush filmic vernacular, Campion shows how these two figures were not only fiercely devoted to their work but also kindred spirits.
2606	There will never be a tamer, lamer movie made about streetball.
2607	Their trip into space may be another small step for man, but it's a giant leap backward for the comic-book-turned-action-movie genre.
2608	It's a strangely lacklustre film that's happy to plonk Murray in a vaguely interesting crisis situation -- in this case, war-torn Afghanistan -- and just hope for the best.
2609	"Days"" terrifically evinces those days' timorous uncertainty of whether Red dread over ending the world matched Yankee angst. The knowing glances at its conclusion speak volumes: The planet's lucky break had only to do with random chance."
2610	Rather than pick apart rituals... Weinstein simply lets us see them in action as part of the natural fabric of Menashe's life.
2611	Beneath the glossy visuals and the power-pop soundtrack there's something quietly radical about Love, Simon.
2612	A better title, a million ways to laugh in the West.
2613	I was held by Depp's transformation from white-man non-entity to the Jarmusch version of the affectless Man With No Name.
2614	If it's a good heist movie you're after, there are surely better ways to go than with this limp caper.
2615	A must-see romantic comedy that evokes the late John Hughes but traces its own path of inclusion, maturity and self discovery. -[Full review in Spanish]
2616	It is a well crafted film, but I am also saying this is definitely not my cup of tea, and I will never, ever subject myself to watching it again. This film rates a B, mainly for horror fans.
2617	If Cormac McCarthy had written Mad Max or Sergio Leone had shot a spaghetti western in Australia it might look something like The Rover.
2618	Secret Window is an intense thriller, adapted from a novella by Stephen King, that presents a rounded anatomy of resentment and anger.
2619	Engaging and enjoyable to watch, if not exactly as weighty as its subject matter.
2620	Concerned with pat platitudes about learning to say goodbye, the importance of family, and the superiority of parental leniency over authoritarian strictness.
2621	Most likely, it was the intent of screenwriter Graham Moore to make a puzzle out a film about puzzle solving. That is not necessarily a bad thing, however, once the pieces fall into in place.
2622	With it's share of Jerry Maguire moments mixed with real romance corn, Hitch is well worth the date. 
2623	"With an excellent cast and expert direction, Matchstick Men just may con you into having a rollicking good time. The bonus is you won't mind being ""taken"" at all."
2624	MacFarlane has upped his cinematic ambitions, but he's failed to improve his joke-crafting, his narrative sense or his acting.
2625	Shattered my heart into a million little pieces.
2626	Fans of the book and film should rest easy at how this 'Dragon Tattoo' is still inherently a Swedish tale - set and partly shot in Sweden - and Fincher doesn't flinch from the sexual violence at their core.
2627	Holds your interest, but it's ultimately pointless, and the ending lets him off the hook.
2628	squanders rich source material, opting for cliches and stock situations instead... Forget 'Raging Bull' -- this is Raging Baloney.
2629	Entertaining, if slightly predictable.
2630	"Jonah Hex"" is a movie missing every element of what makes a movie. It's a gritty comic book adaptation without the grit. It has characters without character in a story without storytelling. "
2631	just another rowdy boys' party, rather than an insightful celebration
2632	"No movie with as many excellent actors as ""The Imitation Game"" can fail to be interesting."
2633	The acting by Winslet and Lynskey is superb.
2634	Everything about The Sorcerer's Stone pretty much applies to the adaptation of the second novel in the series.
2635	Petersen, known for the efficient and vigorously muscular action of Das Boot and In the Line of Fire, once again directs with galvanizing intensity, but the relentlessness of these thrills carries little in the way of surprise.
2636	The biggest drawback here is that Charlyne Yi has no screen presence.
2637	Sweet, squeezable, happily out of touch with the world as we know it ... Won't burn up the box office, but will do well enough as a word-of-mouth attraction on the VOD circuit.
2638	Succeeds as a moody, evocative, and pleasing film, one that underscores its indie roots in sentiment as well as style.
2639	...a mix of history, lurid melodrama, sex, politics, and two top-notch actresses, making for a most entertaining brew.
2640	Delivers fewer laughs than its predecessor.
2641	If this picture were a little more ludicrous, just a shade more inane, it might be fun to watch. Unhappily, that is not the case.
2642	Filled with so many moments of eccentricity that I wasn't sure whether I was supposed to take it all seriously or just laugh. Is the movie a heartwarming coming-of-age film or a parody of one?
2643	What's spot-on is the performances of the three lead actresses, Annette Bening, Naomi Watts and Kerry Washington.
2644	This is a very watchable film...not your standard rom-com garbage.
2645	Nebraska is gentle, heartfelt, and strikes an emotional chord that falls right in line with director Alexander Payne's other recent works.
2646	The satisfying ending occurs about five minutes before the contrived, tacked-on Hollywood ending.
2647	The Edge of Seventeen captures the spirit of classic John Hughes comedies - at the same time, refining and innovating Hughes' storytelling approach.
2648	Movies that are labeled 'feel-good' often sound as inviting as a Sally Field Oscar acceptance speech, but Billy Elliot, a U.K. import, comes by its sentiment honestly.
2649	This is a quiet, contemplative comedy whose comedic moments seem secondary in importance to its deeper, more beautiful ones.
2650	McDonagh is gifted enough to make you feel like you're watching something important and penetrating, rather than just bilious
2651	The characters are fully dimensional, the performances perceptive and well-modulated.
2652	Generally successful.
2653	... the best-looking Bond movie ever made. Roger Deakins' cinematography is full of striking silhouettes, some stark and simple as woodcuts, others multi-layered and illusory.
2654	Despite stand-out moments both epic and intimate, Clint's latest is a film about death that's likely to put many audiences to sleep.
2655	One sexual episode follows another without really building toward anything, making a finale in which Brandy spells out what she's learned from her experiences ring all the more false.
2656	This is the sort of stylish, low-budget offering that can kick-start a film-making career, but while its cast ratchet up the tension, the over-use of nightmares and some obvious plot holes may frustrate commercial audiences.
2657	Enjoyable little film that nonetheless already feels overrated.
2658	Very funny at times, and certainly worth seeing. It's probably the best modern Christmas movie out there to rent and watch with your kids.
2659	"It is as if time has passed the movie by. ""Jurassic Park"" remains solid entertainment, but the awe and wonder have faded."
2660	While corsets/fishnets fit as seamlessly as jackets/trousers worn by the hero, the feature format isn't tailor-made for novelist/tv writer Ames -- giving us vignettes rather than an arcing storyline.
2661	"Yes, it's supposed to be dreadful, but it turns out that ""Crank: High Voltage"" is genuinely insufferable...Surely something so gleefully disgusting shouldn't have to work this hard to make an impression."
2662	Regardless of how decent this film is, it won't change a life.
2663	Ralph Breaks the Internet provides a prime example of how to properly craft a sequel.
2664	One of the all-time great films.
2665	Even Stiller, who I've always appreciated, seems to be going through the motions here.
2666	Until a cop-out ending, this is War of the Roses territory, where laughs take no prisoners.
2667	Morgen recaptures the unreal air of the whole chapter; you can imagine young audiences understanding, perhaps for the first time, what the fuss was about.
2668	It's a pleasure -- a relief, even -- to see that Sylvester Stallone can still act.
2669	Peltola [gives] a deadpan performance that combines the comic gravity of Buster Keaton and the sweet sentiment of Charlie Chaplin.
2670	Just the thing for the summertime movie blahs: it's a genuinely satisfying cheap thrill.
2671	Wrong Turn is basically a well-made waste of time.
2672	Offers diminishing returns in both laughs and heart.
2673	Vintage Hitchcock. The tracking shot near the end is priceless, a great example of using the camera to let the audience in on something while the hero remains in the dark.
2674	A bleak, bitter, brilliant portrayal of the failure of the fifties version of the American dream it so beautifully captures in period terms.
2675	Ridiculously stark. 
2676	As frothy, upbeat tales of old Hollywood go, it's superb, full of small delights and general sunshine.
2677	Sausage Party is a delicious treat covered in a filthy wrapper. For some, that will be a deal breaker, but for plenty of others, it will be a selling point.
2678	With the whole of America as his backdrop, Penn pulls off his most ambitious movie yet. The result is a beautiful and thought-provoking road movie.
2679	A bit slow-going and strangely emotionless at times. But Bill Paxton's nervous expressions add humor, and the film's jaw-dropping glimpse at the Titanic are powerful, to say the least.
2680	A film of great power and integrity, fiercely attentive to the tipping point of progress and the difficult decisions that push it forward.
2681	In an otherwise boneheaded hour and a half of intrigue and silliness, The Skulls does offer one of the more memorable lines of dialogue in recent movies.
2682	It doesn't help the cause of the picture that both its tone and thematic emphasis change abruptly in the final stretch.
2683	While it's a truism that all comedy has an element of sadism, it doesn't necessarily follow that all sadism is funny.
2684	Folks who go for this sort of thing will find it the sort of thing they go for. But the rest of us may find reason to scratch our heads and scratch again.
2685	"Too sane and predictable to be effective satire, nor should you expect the surrealism of a ""Dr. Strangelove"" or the humor of a ""Mash."
2686	Assassination is a throwback to another time when films were allowed to be unhurried, when audiences trusted multiple story lines to converge organically, and time and place were evoked with consummate craft.
2687	This tough, violent and starkly impressive thriller succeeds in its main aim, which is to keep the viewer on the edge of the seat.
2688	...despite reservations about the goofy plot and the cocky characters, the movie proceeds pleasantly enough.
2689	A hackneyed drama in which even Helen Mirren can't make much out of her bewildered character.
2690	If you're looking for a dark, funny, sometimes caustic, comedy that is a challenge to the mind ... make tracks to the theater and ask to see Nurse Betty.
2691	This one is terrible to watch, but crucial to see.
2692	The film is much like its title character: Its colorful cutesy-pie surface camouflages a dark interior. 
2693	A challenge and affirmation of our most basic notions of faith.
2694	Bittersweet whimsy pervades the biting humor as Allen once again examines the subject of romance and the bumbling, self-destructive ways people go about trying to find it and then to hang on to it
2695	I'm certainly not a fan of Space Jam, but it's hard to deny its rich tapestry of questionable ideas. 
2696	[Pootie's] nonsense vocab eventually loses the power to impress.
2697	Despite its sad scenes, it sentimentalizes. It attributes human emotions and motivations to its central animals. Its music instructs us how to feel. And the narration and overall approach get in the way of the visual material.
2698	To be admired rather than enjoyed, but a considerable achievement nonetheless.
2699	This one is for Johnny Depp devotees only. The animation is good but the overall effect of the movie is dull.
2700	One of the most delightful, family-friendly animated films in some time.
2701	A crass, simple-minded and dumb film.
2702	A foul dog of a film.
2703	Even during the most intense moments, it's hard to shake the impression that the conspicuously buff-and-polished Justine is only visiting this drab world, her miserable life an interesting career move.
2704	Even if the end result is a movie that feels surprisingly conventional, given the demented turns it takes, it's still a real pleasure getting to the end.
2705	Cheap laughs are better than no laughs at all.
2706	There aren't many comic actors I admire more than Matthau, and he does his best to be an old man in Kotch, but the illusion simply isn't there.
2707	Almost everything about the film is disappointing.
2708	In films like this, nobody is ever in two minds about anything. Nobody is ever out of character. And that is a deficiency in the screenwriting that pays too little heed to the source material.
2709	A subterranean microcosm of life... a hellish retreat... the underbelly of society... comedy relief... miles of irony.
2710	Bird has made a traditional action movie full of chases, crashes and stunt work.
2711	A bizarre tween movie vehicle for the High School Musical star Vanessa Hudgens that gradually morphs into a two-hour homily on the perils of adolescence.
2712	"Similar yet better domestic dramas that come to mind for comparison purposes include ""In the Bedroom,"" ""Little Children"" and ""American Beauty."
2713	Mother and Child isn't a hard-hitting drama, but rather a precious, soulful look at family, love, and loss.
2714	The Break-Up is a funny and light comedy, but it tries to be something a bit more without being something a bit more, hampered by shoddy characterization, ending up a bit empty.
2715	Cranston's ability to straddle a moral divide gives the film the bit of complexity and intimacy it needs.
2716	Yentl is all about, who else? Miss Streisand. But her vast talents turn a gender-bending fable into a winner.
2717	A slice-of-life story that does a good job italicizing how little moments in the big scheme of things can seem like monumental disasters while one is in high school.
2718	A comedy that's openly afraid to seem too sincere or too mawkish, and doesn't fully commit either to its comedy or its uplift. Like Murray, it's wry and presented largely in air quotes, with an accompanying eye-roll.
2719	What can one say? Exquisitely controlled, framed, scored, acted, and edited. A peerless triumph.
2720	With blinders on to deflect the obvious - that this movie isn't remotely believable - The Wedding Date skates by on the charm of its actors. 
2721	This is the movie that I've been waiting for David Fincher to make since Fight Club.
2722	This film's title is accurate. Tupac Shakur is more alive than he's ever been -- and more endlessly fascinating than ever.
2723	...an agreeable companion piece to its admittedly superior predecessor.
2724	Inevitably the film simplifies a good deal of the book's complexity but McGregor's biggest mistake is to cast himself in the leading role.
2725	Though less of a virtuoso work than Hero, House of Flying Daggers is much more emotionally immediate.
2726	While it takes sizable liberties with history to move us, it is at times genuinely stirring.
2727	Well-made, pleasant, diverting, unobjectionable -- and absolutely nothing special.
2728	The home video sets up A Perfect Getaway's frank understanding of itself as formula.
2729	...romantic and romanticized, sudsy and sentimental...a throwback to an earlier age in Hollywood when movies didn't have to be loud or vulgar to sell a point.
2730	The Ring just left me cold and wet like I was out in the Seattle drizzle without rainwear.
2731	While you have to admire American Hustle for its willingness to work hard and play harder, it's also hard to not notice that all of its frantic efforts don't really go anywhere new.
2732	It's good how they bring the characters back, however, it's not enough to keep our eyes on the screen and not the clock. [Full review in Spanish]
2733	Has its pluses.
2734	The movie succeeds on some level, but the series has definitely begun to eat its own with Hannibal Rising.
2735	The quieter moments are when the actors get to do good work.
2736	Not as original as the first film, but it's more daring and inventive.
2737	...turns from anti-buddy comedy to classically British small-village science fiction paranoia.
2738	So good-natured and life-loving, and Vardalos' Toula is so quick-witted and adorable, that we have little problem understanding why Ian would want to get in on the fun.
2739	Stallone's retro actioner is a cheesy, schlocky anachronistic flick, sort of a class reunion of the genre's stars of the past two decades.
2740	Arguably the best script that Besson has written in years.
2741	A sincere tribute to the tape-based dumpy Sound City.
2742	It's a profoundly stupid plot.... The amazing feat is that, while the film has you in its grasp, you barely notice. Genius.
2743	How sad that a brilliant comic creation like Bugs Bunny has to ride shotgun with a wooden basketball star, all to provide a set of collector's cups.
2744	Still Alice benefits from solid acting down the line -- Kristen Stewart is especially fine as Moore's struggling actress daughter -- but it exists in a rarefied world of privilege unknown to most Alzheimer's patients.
2745	Wimmer's narrative sloppiness makes one think he's popped a few too many pills, since Equilibrium often feels like a sense offense itself.
2746	Not as good as The Fault is in Our Stars but the producers of this one do hit a perfect teen movie note. 
2747	I was particularly impressed by Jack Kilmer and Nat Wolff. Those two central performances are very strong. 
2748	Teens fear the reaper in this so-so thriller.
2749	Marlon Wayans is killing his own potential, screaming his way into comedic oblivion.
2750	Really not very funny. Unless you're a moronic frat boy who's been smoking a lot of wacky backy, in which case it's probably hilarious.
2751	It ends up being quite moving, supported by excellent performances to create an effective drama. [Full Review in Spanish] 
2752	This is one occasion where too many cooks in the kitchen actually ended up making some pretty tasty junk food. 
2753	... almost two and a half hours in which [Julia Roberts] displays her charisma... [Full review in Spanish]
2754	A screenplay that reduces deep emotions into low-cal, risk-free hissy fits that can be settled with a misty-eyed hug.
2755	The movie is drenched in atmosphere and dread, as we'd expect from Schrader, but it also has spiritual weight and texture, boldly confronting the possibility that Satan may be active in the world.
2756	The three preceding Scary Movie films were all bad, yet, nevertheless, better than this.
2757	David and Scott Hillenbrand's stoner horror-comedy predictably provides more groans than laughs. The filmmakers had better pray someone in the theater is holding, if you know what we mean.
2758	What works best in the film are the special effects, clearly the primary focus as the talented cast gets less attention than the CGI and wire work.
2759	A better, stranger movie can be glimpsed straining to be noticed behind Rogen's standard goofery.
2760	Travolta is trying a little too hard here, and it shows.
2761	Loud...lurid...and the best film of the summer
2762	It reeks of desperation, among other things.
2763	There is no real sense of connection between human and alien - like between the Na'vi and Jake Sully - that would have pulled John Carter out of the grandiose B-movie league.
2764	The latest from Pedro Almodovar is a melo-tragicomedy so twisty that it eventually twisted the interest right out of me.
2765	Less than the sum of its parts; colorful, but not quite a forceful enough inquisition into the go-go, power-grab pop intersection of fame, tabloidism and information management to connect in lasting emotional fashion.
2766	How Do You Know gets by on witty and realistic dialogue even when its story is sloppy.
2767	It's confusing in tone, though very funny at times, especially coming from Cooper and Lawrence, but by the end, Russell feels he's warranted an emotional reaction from the audience when he's done anything but. 
2768	There are so few movies that dare to build themselves around female leads that Carol comes across as outrageously daring. It should not be, but there we are.
2769	"Love Ranch"" is an off-key biopic that doesn't know where to begin or end. "
2770	Leiner...wants to say something important, but his cinematic and narrative technique isn't up to the task.
2771	If the best parts of Disclosure are its sideshows, its biggest drawback is that infernal infatuation the filmmakers have with technology and power.
2772	Goran Dukic, working from a short story by Etgar Kiret, has fashioned a life-after-death that is both somber and silly.
2773	Call Me By Your Name has been marketed as a gay romance, yet less overt is its inclusion of Jewish culture.
2774	A ludicrous and laughable sequel that desecrates the name of a fantastic original.
2775	A decent, American, inspirational, Rocky-esque story.
2776	The first half of this film is just pure joy.
2777	It suffocates you with one faux thrill after another.
2778	Hollywood managed to not only not screw this one up, but actually made it one of the best movies of the year.
2779	A trifle filled with nostalgia and fantasy touristy fare.
2780	A slam-bang start to the summer. 
2781	The result is a rare delight: A romantic comedy that's both deeply romantic and very funny.
2782	One of my favorites of the year so far, without a doubt.
2783	At its heart, this is basically the story of one man's attempt to prove that his life has meaning. What could be more relatable than that?
2784	Every beat of Yi's manufactured crisis of faith feels as pre-programmed in its own way as a Michael Bay movie.
2785	In Talk to Me, director Kasi Lemmons has expertly crafted an uplifting civil rights-era biopic free of false hope and cloying nostalgia.
2786	Not great, but is very watchable romance comedy.
2787	With all due respect to Japanese animation fans and pop-culture enthusiasts, life may be just too short to plunge into the busy world of Cowboy Bebop.
2788	A period melodrama that's soppier than a seaman's mop.
2789	The Libertine is an unpleasant film to watch, and it should be, since it zeroes in on the pain of not being able to connect to other people.
2790	An astonishing, deeply engrossing Italian family saga that happens to be six hours long.
2791	Sausage Party is the perfect antidote to what has honestly been one of the weakest summer movie seasons in recent years.
2792	With Alfie, it's all about displacement.
2793	The humor is mostly flat and obvious, but Anna Faris' ability to maintain a straight face as well as her dignity under the most demeaning of circumstances continues to impress.
2794	Director John Moore pays homage to the video game by pushing the slo-mo button during action sequences in a fashion that would make John Woo weep tears of sorrow. He's not the only one.
2795	There must be some reason to worry over the fate of these people, but it's not in the movie.
2796	A dumb, ridiculous movie filled with enough tough-guy stares and male posturing to last you the entire summer. But it's also high on extreme stunts and crazy car crashes, carried off with minimal aid from CGI, which is actually very refreshing.
2797	... plodding, special interest movie that feels more like a Golf Channel original production than a full-blown major motion picture.
2798	Like Lon Chaney or Buster Keaton, Depp tosses off endless bits of physical business as if they were little poems.
2799	Entertaining, somewhat overlong biopic has edgy material.
2800	Chemistry is the reason things click. Actors with the ability to connect their characters to you always overcome a multitude of movie sins. 
2801	... a boring parade of talking heads and technical gibberish that will do little to advance the Linux cause.
2802	"A mix of gently outraged populism and low-powered romantic comedy, Vishal Bhardwaj's ""Matru ki Bijlee ka Mandola"" might have been better with a chunk lopped off its two-and-a-half-hour runtime."
2803	...tragic, comic, violent, tender and heartbreaking.
2804	The family is bigger, but the laughs aren't.
2805	Even the bloopers during the closing credits stink.
2806	Unlike the usual run-of-the-mill rom-com, this film bristles with life from the central core of the love story, to the quirky band of supporting players who add to the fun.
2807	Matt Damon talks to the dead in Hereafter, though after awhile, it's hard to tell who's who.
2808	Alexander Payne has crafted an ornery American comedy with a brusque Midwestern edge and a core of authentic feeling. It provokes wise, wary laughter even as it makes you choke back tears.
2809	It's certainly not the worst of the found-footage subgenre, but it's a far cry from its Sixties- and Seventies-era cinematic inspirations.
2810	Thin and utterly lacking in tension.
2811	...far from engrossing...
2812	Neither Arnold Schwarzenegger nor Paul Verhoeven have stretched their talents here.
2813	A harmless, genial sitcom comedy that has little bite in its political and sexual agenda...
2814	Spielberg's films never lack a certain degree of narrative and visual force, but his tendency toward sentimentality, a strictly antipodal, Good-vs.-Bad conception of character, and an insensitivity to structure have consistently marred his work...
2815	Cooper gives a fine performance in a difficult role, but the one who really shines is Lawrence. Beautiful and sexy, she should be up for awards for this one. 
2816	"A virtuoso achievement for everyone involved whose final credits actually read ""Music by Clint Eastwood"". If a more apropos coda could exist, I couldn't think of one."
2817	Like a rotten vaudeville act, this one deserves the hook.
2818	While Russell's movie doesn't quite capture the freewheeling dementia of [Charlie] Kaufman's output, it's still a noteworthy effort.
2819	The Cloverfield Paradox tries to wedge itself into Bad Robot's franchise, but ultimately comes off as a quickie fixer-upper with enough story issues of its own.
2820	This is an almost too-inspirational story of the integrity and wisdom displayed by Nelson Mandela as he tried to unite his fractured nation. And Freeman was born for this role.
2821	This palpable nonsense, which has a plot that defies all but Hollywood's logic, is so smartly produced and directed that even its inordinate length doesn't matter all that much.
2822	Feels like an afterthought, a trial-and-error effort in the search for the ideal Owen Wilson solo vehicle.
2823	"Palo Alto"" has a strong feel for youthful fumblings that fall between self-pity and self-definition, and it's especially wise about the parallel world of American adolescents ..."
2824	Somewhere in all of this, there is the potential for a pretty good comedy, but this movie isn't it.
2825	Exercise your consumer power. Don't rent this trash.
2826	Lazarus and Rae may be looking for something as basic as redemption, but the road to get there is an unconventional one that drips with authenticity. They are full-blooded, fully realized characters the likes of which we do not see much these days.
2827	The dialogues are well managed from the coprolalia of their characters. [Full Review in Spanish]
2828	...simultaneously evokes and deflates our image of the iconic American West.
2829	Develops a curious mood of impending fate and final destiny that rides along with the action.
2830	The film hits a nice groove in the interplay between Craig and Mara, together and apart, and Fincher displays his usual mastery at explicating the finer points of an investigation.
2831	What's old is new again in this dreamy romance. What's antiquated seems innovative.
2832	The rest of the mayhem is simply ultraviolent, nonstop, and numbing. Better jokes might have helped.
2833	...an impressively designed world that lacks the danger, wonder and sexiness needed to become a classic. Frankly, the movie seems too epic for Stanton's talents. 
2834	Perfect is too superficially knowing to be a camp classic, but it's an unintentionally hilarious mixture of muddled moralizing and all-too-contemporary self-promotion.
2835	Director Ron Maxwell wants us to know how war affected Northern and Southern soldiers, Irish immigrants, African-Americans, women and children. He tries to tell too many stories and fails to tell any of them well.
2836	From sets and costumes to Alexandre Desplat's musical score, The Imitation Game is everything classy that Hollywood wishes it could be.
2837	Deutch has no discernible style; the scenes march ahead with only one development per scene, much like the worst in American television.
2838	"I'd take Carly Simon and Pooh any day over Ice Cube and the Hateful Little Maggots of ""Are We There Yet?"
2839	"Sharp of tongue, generous of spirit, Silver Linings Playbook is a jagged, loopy romantic comedy about ""crazy"" people that insists, deep down, we're all a little nuts."
2840	Overall, for a film trying to cash in on internet culture, it's not half bad. It doesn't go for any moralizing statements about screen time or get on a soapbox about the potential dangers of it all.
2841	"The characters feel a little too condescendingly conceived as ""ordinary people"" to make this meaningful."
2842	While the film will have very limited appeal for casual moviegoers, Inherent Vice is great genre entertainment for intellectual and/or cinephile types.
2843	Call me a reactionary but after I saw this I wanted to turn back the clock to the days of Pete Seeger and the Weavers.
2844	"One of those ""never heard of it"" cable flicks that's actually worth a look."
2845	Miyazaki is a genius.
2846	This movie, like the first, is more of a translation than an adaptation. It's the visual equivalent of an audio book, slightly abridged.
2847	This second effort is even better than the first go around.
2848	The Dressmaker is a fun and at times touching romp through the Outback, as well as a feast for the eyes and ears.
2849	This film sticks like high heels in gravel coming out of the gate. But after the necessary unpleasantness are over the bulk of the film is actually quite entertaining, funny and, well, cute.
2850	[Boasts] an observational approach, naturalistic appearance, fly-on-the-wall feel and authentic air.
2851	[An] earthy, gently comic tale of death and family dysfunction.
2852	Don't look for gravity-bound logic here. This is cartoon fantasy, not a literal translation, although in its way it stays pretty close to Stevenson's characters and storyline.
2853	Sean Penn deserves huge credit for the gentle hand he has used in telling this incredible story.
2854	Has nothing to offer but a lively ensemble cast and beautiful scenery while falling flat as a comedy that's painfully low on laughs and high on juvenile, asinine and uninspired attempts at humor.
2855	Although the film and the actors keep on looking good, this solemn, soppy, fantasy has nothing to say about science or faith.
2856	Being a baseball fan involves repeatedly experiencing exquisite pain and exquisite joy. Well, there's a lot of both in The Natural.
2857	Cooper and Lawrence have a nice, believable chemistry, and by the time they get to the dance competition it's surprising how tense it is and much you are rooting for them.
2858	What do ninjas and surfers have to do with each other? You've got me, and I heroically sat through all of Surf Ninjas.
2859	Rogan and company frequently mistake an overabundance of four-letter words for genuine humor.
2860	All in all I think of it as The Hobbit: A Better Than Expected Journey.
2861	This isn't worth turning off the PlayStation to go see.
2862	At this point, Lucas is in no position to be picky about his remaining fans.
2863	[T]he real lesson here may be for Haley Joel Osment, who could well have Dickie Roberts II in his future. 
2864	Hanks and Roberts make this sketchy project better than it deserves to be.
2865	I don't want to give too much away but this unsettling tale is told so beautifully, so precisely.
2866	Worth watching for the electrifying chemistry of its love-struck leads alone.
2867	An odd little movie -- and a bit too leisurely paced -- that was largely overlooked on its original release.
2868	It's been a long time since the movies have seen a fuse of pure ardor burn this slowly and steadily, leading to such an unexpectedly moving explosion of resolve.
2869	Mao's Last Dancer is an appealing and, by its end, quite moving film.
2870	"Is there something lighter than ""featherweight""?"
2871	If you're looking for a decent action flick, Timeline should fit the bill.
2872	A terrific time at the movies. Comes a lot closer to being on-par with the beloved sci-fi movies of our youth than most modern blockbusters. 
2873	The austere, cerebral 'Dominion' is a serious and ambitious alternative to Harlin's movie, but it's only marginally superior to it.
2874	A delightful, perceptive, funny, detail-perfect fable.
2875	I could almost recommend this action movie as an entertaining ride, but I wouldn't pay theater-price to see it.
2876	Funny people abound, such as Cedric the Entertainer, Mo'Nique, Mike Epps, etc., but their antics can't save this lazy, bloated, stupid affair.
2877	A human rubber band, a transparent woman, a guy on fire, a walking rock pile, and a guy named Doom seem perfectly plausible in the funny books.On the big screen, not so much.
2878	A clever and majestic hybrid of art house fare and middle brow entertainment.
2879	Walter Matthau gives a compelling, Oscar-nominated performance as a grumpy old man in this melodrama, the only film star Jack Lemmon directed.
2880	Bears some similarities with Elephant. A similarly photogenic teen milieu is shot with fluid, graceful camerawork; a non-linear structure slots together like a puzzle to reveal the panicked mindset of a boy under agreat deal of stress.
2881	With inventive ideas like this, the series can clearly run and run. But they really need to take it to another level now.
2882	A bizarre, captivating and somewhat sad new documentary.
2883	Think Boogie Nights meets Casino, though it's not likely to make the lasting impression of either seminal film.
2884	This adaptation captures the spirit of the video games and with its fun, anything can happen mindset and tons of over the top violence, 'Resident Evil' proves there may be a future for video game movies yet.
2885	This futuristic thriller just seems to keep getting better with age. An entertaining sci-fi flick done before special effects took over the genre.
2886	Surprisingly half-decent high-concept chick-flick material.
2887	Inherent Vice is a superbly controlled burst of chaos, a madcap masterwork that understands well the value of letting an audience wonder without leading it astray.
2888	Feels more like a calculated product than a work of art.
2889	Writer-director PJ Hogan has some unexpected twists in store before his quirky farce reaches its uplifting conclusion.
2890	"Is it as good as ""Duel"", ""Breakdown"" or ""The Hitcher""? Let me just say that I would not be ashamed to mention it in the same list."
2891	The creators of Wallace and Gromit can usually be relied upon for a chuckle. This time, alas, you may struggle to raise a smile while sitting through this dull tale.
2892	It's a film that features some of Black's trademark wit but it's far too inconsistent for anyone who isn't a die-hard fan of either Shane Black or the Predator films.
2893	In a dazzling movie about the art of the con, Jennifer Lawrence -- playing a feisty and frustrated New York housewife -- manages to steal all her scenes. 
2894	[The film] is able to move emotionally, from the rage of an idle summer to the icy winter...From the rhythm of an eighties song, to the soft, sharp and hurtful melody of Sufjan Stevens. [Full Review in Spanish]
2895	A delicious comedy of manners, Bunuel's Oscar winner is a descendant of the audaciously surreal Golden Age, a light satire of the trivial, conformist bourgeois lifestyle.
2896	A film of only very limited charm.
2897	What's not to like?
2898	things get really schmaltzy near the end, and without caring about the sport of rugby, I was extremely bored with the over-long and drawn-out climax of the movie
2899	A sturdy but uninspired crime docudrama that's neither convincingly colloquial nor thrillingly stylish.
2900	We see very little of the women's vicissitudes, or the ways in which they support one another through their club.
2901	Too compromised to be more than a reasonably pleasurable entertainment, as if it is scared about what it is saying about the American political process.
2902	Han Solo? Your ship has flown. Indiana Jones? Move over. Captain Malcolm Reynolds is the big screen's most engaging and heroic rogue in decades.
2903	As an undercover crime thriller, Brad Furman's The Infiltrator only barely works. If anything, it makes a life of crime look gloriously entertaining, aside from the occasional brutal murder that happens in your presence.
2904	It's way too hackneyed for John Hughes. He's already shown us that he knows better.
2905	This story can be seen as especially timely.
2906	It's the journey itself that provides the unexpected, often queasy twists and turns. Let's just say that the recent Shrek spinoff isn't the only Antonio Banderas film that could have been released with the title Puss in Boots.
2907	Bart Got A Room is an affectionately nuanced comedy of manners whose focus is first love and the navigation of complex relationships.
2908	It uses an old-time formula, it's not terribly original and it's rather messy -- but you just have to love the big, dumb, happy movie My Big Fat Greek Wedding.
2909	The To Do List peters out to a lamentable degree in its padded-out final half hour. 
2910	Children of Invention is appealing as a modest appreciation of certain strengths of innocence.
2911	There have been surprisingly few cinematic renderings of Martin Luther King Jr's legacy, but despite the lack of competition, British actor David Oyelowo's embodiment of the great man is simply superb.
2912	Elegantly demented, this gorgeous film is a classy piece of perversion that thrills as much as it horrifies.
2913	The Bourne Identity is a blockbuster without a point... Despite its good-looking veneer, its breakneck pace, its daisy-chain of expert set-pieces, some crucial logic or motive appears to have been junked along the way.
2914	The Infiltrator is an assured piece of filmmaking that spins a familiar tale extremely well.
2915	Cameron Crowe returns from movie exile with We Bought a Zoo, a sweet and sentimental ode to new beginnings that features a charming performance from Matt Damon.
2916	First-time director Laurence Dunsmore ... enjoys his wallow in London murk and mud, but nobody else will.
2917	Many entertaining characters, a rockin' space adventure, plenty of eye-catching animation.
2918	Charlton Heston's solid turn in a more life-sized role is the centerpiece of this darkly haunting western.
2919	The dark, dreamy cityscapes created for the film are almost as alive as the characters.
2920	... character gets sacrificed for just another true-crime drama.
2921	It's a moving drama about two themes not often brought together in the cinema -- adultery and retirement.
2922	Like its protagonist, it never hands you explanations on a silver platter, and it makes you think a bit, something far too few thrillers do these days.
2923	[T]his feels like a thematic juggling act.
2924	The film's characters see their every disaffection hauntingly reflected onto the sounds and landscapes of the city they inhabit.
2925	While the melodrama is ladled on fast and thick at times, it is performed with sufficient conviction that we are drawn in rather than left on the outside laughing at it.
2926	Nimrod Antal's defiantly mordant comedy is smart, imaginative -- and nearly impossible to watch.
2927	"Said Joss Whedon: ""One time my cat spit up and Universal bought the treatment. They'd film the phone book if only they could find the action sequence."
2928	You can't be too hard on a film that blows up a Rainforest Cafe, can you?
2929	I can only say that it kept me gripped from first to last.
2930	"Provocative and mesmerizing, ""First Reformed"" is a film that demands to be seen."
2931	This is a footnote rather than a film.
2932	As a sociological milestone, this is not quite in the Black Panther class, but the difference lies only in the size of the film's financial ambitions.
2933	Marshall's approach is simultaneously accessible and exotic, a breathtaking introduction that exposes without spoiling a world of carefully guarded mystery.
2934	Anne Hathaway concludes the thorough evolution from Disney princess to serious actress. With commanding wit and a deft British accent, she's more than convincing as a wickedly intelligent woman restricted by proper society.
2935	Any sympathy developed for the characters quickly erodes as they continue to not only engage in self-destructive behavior but expose children to it.
2936	A film that actually feels more modern than most of what we see nowadays, sixty some years later.
2937	one of the oddest star vehicles to come out of the Hollywood dream factory in some time...Depp and Jolie know exactly what they are doing. Jolie has never been more ludicrously Barbie-Doll/Sophia Loren glamorous
2938	All the innocence of the Beethoven film series but with more dogs.
2939	People were cheering, but I was cheering because it was over.
2940	While the story is sentimental, heartfelt acting makes its impact less manipulative.
2941	The laughs are few and far between, bearing only a sloppy, derivative resemblance to its predecessor.
2942	To vindicate a much-maligned term, it's a nice picture.
2943	The high quality of most of the acting makes this otherwise pointless and indulgent movie at least watchable.
2944	The screenplay aims wide for every snappy, pop-culture joke that can possibly be cracked. But the viewer's funnybone remains an elusive target.
2945	An uncompromisingly bleak slow burn, it leaves the pulse frantic and nerves frayed.
2946	A fun enough ambiguously gay carsploitation flick even though it's instantly forgettable.
2947	Even in its darkest moments, a heartening defiance underlies gut-wrenching calamity.
2948	Good movie. Good actress. But if you expect light romantic comedy, good gosh, will you be shocked.
2949	As prodigious a talent as Prince was, he only altered the funk. The megalithic, trail-blazing talent of James Brown birthed it. And Chadwick Boseman nails the telling of it.
2950	Moody, involving and endlessly inventive, Treasure Planet lacks only the element of delight, of joyfulness that marks the very best animation has to offer.
2951	Mendes digs into suburban life with a riveting and ultimately stark marital drama.... And it's the terrific acting that keeps us engaged.
2952	The little green guy just isn't quite the same these days.
2953	It's clear the stuffing was already pulled out of Ted in the first Ted, so here's hoping Seth MacFarlane grabs a clue and says goodbye to his little friend.
2954	"'Hitchcock' is the 'JFK' of movies about moviemaking, but at least Oliver Stone had the excuse of Jim Garrison's ""findings"" to hang his loony fiction on. "
2955	Its 'Hoosiers' in the hood
2956	A affecting comedy that opens our hearts and minds to the plight of the lonely.
2957	Vivid performances from Elgort and Egerton make it worth watching.
2958	American Dreamz lampoons the public's appetite for mindless entertainment and easy distraction from serious concerns.
2959	Mildly amusing but not great comedy, penned by the Ephrons from a stage play, this eighth teaming of Tracy and Hepburn places the battle of the sexes in the workplace against the threat of new technology.
2960	It Comes at Night may disappoint some hardcore horror fans with its artful avoidance of genre pleasures, but its grim, tough-minded dystopia will prove hard to shake for many.
2961	Hawke and Delpy keep the tone not only afloat but mesmerizing. So natural are their performances that it seems impossible not to believe they truly are soulmates who are locked in a doomed, all-too-short affair.
2962	There's Theron, like a force of nature, compelling us to go beyond TV-movie supposition and look Wuornos straight in the eye.
2963	A lot of fun to watch, thanks to a darn sturdy cast and a director with a sublime ability to make fluff seem deeper than it really is.
2964	Both painful and exhilarating.
2965	This is a brilliantly constructed, whip-smart, and laugh-out-loud-funny romp from a filmmaker whose precision and craft is nearly unparalleled. 
2966	Plot?...it's the means to get these guys together so they can fight, blow stuff up, compare testosterone levels, have car chases, some comic relief, and a little male-bonding...it delivers the goods.
2967	In a season in which Invincible and Gridiron Gang already have laid claim to the title of inspirational football movie, this looks like an also-ran.
2968	Mr. Zombie's shameless pilfering, derivative and uninspired writing, and ham-fisted direction result in a chaotic mess.
2969	An adequate filmmaking exercise that strikes most of the same beats as Lord of the Rings without any of the importance, epic scope or je ne sais quoi.
2970	By the film's finale you'll pity any poor fool who actually is named Focker -- for following this picture they're certain to see a surge in mockery.
2971	...that rare thing, a top notch comedy orchestrated by a director with a talent for teasing out the unexpected.
2972	the closest you'll get to actually having a nightmare in a movie theatre outside of a midnight screening of David Lynch's Eraserhead. 
2973	As the title implies, it focuses more on the master of suspense than his mastery.
2974	Audiences attuned to these kind of four-person dramas will get pretty much what they expect.
2975	There are a lot of things that could have gone wrong with this material, but Hello, My Name Is Doris avoids all of the possible pitfalls.
2976	Very underrated black comedy from Hitchcock is really one of his best works.
2977	Arid, barren Barsoom is a dull environment for a sci-fi blockbuster, and the consequences of the conflicts happening on screen are small. John Carter just never pulled me in.
2978	An example of what can happen when the lowest common denominator meets a director in sulky decline.
2979	This is the kind of picture that isn't afraid to put its characters under a microscope, and it knows that studying their psychology is far more rewarding than studying their gun-slinging skills.
2980	The superfluous characters are almost as plentiful as the flashbacks. If someone can explain to me what Laura San Giacomo's purpose was in this film, I'll give them a dollar.
2981	"That the film overlooks Austen's imagination becomes understandable when ""Becoming Jane"" reveals itself to be a rather unimaginative second-rate copy of a Jane Austen novel."
2982	A borderline-schizophrenic tone regularly undercuts both the nasty, biting humor and weepy sentimentality.
2983	Hailee Steinfeld is an incredible young actress with a keen ability to portray strength without denying vulnerability, and the other young actors here reach depths beyond mere friend, brother, and admirer.
2984	"Even with Diesel's oblivious self-miscasting - he's a producer on the film - ""Witch Hunter"" feels like genre material that might have found a way to work."
2985	The most purely fun movie ever made.
2986	A terrific holiday movie. Edward Burns' most invigorating, heartfelt picture in years.
2987	Little more than another Hollywood sizzler, a highly melodramatic and perhaps opportunistic look at a couple of topical themes; that said, it's also a lot of fun.
2988	A mirthless comedy about venal people doing stupid things.
2989	I think it is spare-genre filmmaking. It is really, really well done.
2990	Puppet parody of pop culture and politics from the South Park boys is so wrong ... and so funny.
2991	The film is still charming enough, both for its performances and its lovely look at Jane Austen's most devoted suitor of all -- a pristine page, begging her attention, wanting nothing but her words.
2992	"The Artist"" is such an engaging, delightful film that, if you like movies, you will walk out of the theater with a smile. You just will; it's that inspired."
2993	A typically inept effort from William Lustig...
2994	The film is two plodding hours of people abusing themselves, their livers, a corpse, each other and even small animals. Most abused of all is the audience.
2995	Fans of the game and the genre will be disappointed with the lack of gore ... and everyone else will find what plot there is confusing and boring.
2996	Dead Man is surprisingly bland. And it becomes more dull -- and more grotesque -- as it moves along.
2997	"The viewer waits, at first expectantly and later with increasing irritation, as the disparate story strands are forced together in the ""are you kidding?"" finale."
2998	There's something for everyone: comedy, drama and romance.
2999	"With unyielding moral precision no less austere for the lack of any religious conviction behind it, Bergman subjects his protagonist to judgment for the crimes of indifference and selfishness, and pronounces a verdict of ""the usual"" sentence: loneliness."
3000	Smith's occasional sullenness suggests he is itching for another Ali-like chance to prove his acting chops even as he slums his way through another high-tech shoot-'em-up.
3001	American Pastoral is a good novel and now a very bad film. 
3002	Vaughn, Favreau and company phone it in - all the way from Bora Bora - in this lame relationship comedy.
3003	What The Last Witch Hunter really has going for it is Vin Diesel. His character isn't particularly layered and he takes few to no risks with how he plays it, but the result is extremely likeable.
3004	A story as big, as brash, and as exciting as the west itself.
3005	It looks suspiciously like the producers didn't have the budget for crowd scenes, perhaps because they had spent so much on hairspray.
3006	It still may well-deserve consideration as a first-class exploitation flick.
3007	The film is charming, even with the usual Disney paw prints on the themes. Forster handles the comedy with skill and the sentiment with restraint.
3008	The good-hearted and intermittently sweet Love, Rosie attempts through sheer force of will to convince viewers that its good-looking protagonists are a good match.
3009	In Lost in Translation, [Murray] emerges as a complete character -- honourable and venal, fallible and funny, adding vulnerability to the panache.
3010	Miss it at your peril of a better understanding as to why revenge for its own sake might turn out to be worse than the original crime.
3011	With this production budget, you'd think someone in the creative chain might have detected that there was too much dramatic dithering in the screenplay, but entertainment factors survive.
3012	This is a devastating movie to watch and impossible to forget.
3013	In this expertly calibrated debut, Tanovic charts the ebb and flow of these events, which began in a fog and end in a Pyrrhic tie, as a global ripple that is everyone's business.
3014	A smart romantic comedy and a fabulous showcase for its leads and New York City setting.
3015	Hats off to the voice cast, who put the effort in, but the end result remains a surprisingly sticky presentation; slow, stagnant and mysteriously void of charm and warmth.
3016	...may be set in Bora-Bora, but it's about as much fun as a lock down with an obsessive religious cult.
3017	If the movie is trying to help us understand what schizophrenia is, it fails in the attempt.
3018	Notable chiefly for feeding a stereotype of blacks as shiftless layabouts interested mainly in recreational drugs and irresponsible sex.
3019	My Life as a Dog succeeds on an intimate, human scale that is entirely appropriate for a story covering about a year in the life of a pretty ordinary boy in a pretty ordinary place.
3020	Lacks the requisite passion and urgency to make the experience anything more than a periodically pleasant waste of time.
3021	A comedy first, a horror film second... but a successful enough hybrid of those things that it would be wrong to try to limit it generically.
3022	A spellbinding, almost ecstatically beautiful movie that gains even more heft and meaning in its final transcendent moments.
3023	Mother and Child's best moments come from its many small and wonderful character details.
3024	Sayles does what he does best, opening a window onto a slice of life so believable, you'd swear the movie was a documentary if you didn't know better.
3025	Miami Vice is like watching a great chef boil a hotdog.
3026	"Pleasantville"" is a solid premier for director Ross, providing a thought-provoking story, solid acting and wonderful special F/X."
3027	Jeff Maguire, in adapting Crichton's novel, clearly had trouble explaining all the nuances of the story with the constraints of a Hollywood time limit.
3028	It is the unusual film comedy in which the humor springs as much from character as from situation.
3029	Fizzles out in the third act, but we're long past caring. By then, Frances McDormand has usurped the movie and turned it into a lesson in character acting.
3030	Innocuous and forgettable...
3031	It takes more than a few lines of clever dialogue, a hero who reads books, and an actor with British training and lots of dignity to keep a movie from going pretty much by the book.
3032	A movie about people sitting around the desert with nothing to do runs a high risk of being dull, but Phoenix has enough wit, energy and charisma to keep soaring.
3033	What good is a uniquely photographed dance scene if the characters dancing together are barely two-dimensional?
3034	Certainly, the much-ballyhooed performance of Theron is ferocious and terrifying.
3035	The Lazarus Effect starts dead and cannot be raised from it. 
3036	In his directing debut, Dave Grohl shows the instincts of a real filmmaker. Sound City hits you like a shot in the heart. 
3037	It's an inconsequential movie that you'll enjoy while watching but forget completely by the time you get to the parking lot.
3038	Wristcutters: A Love Story is like a suicidal Wizard of Oz.
3039	Every once in a blue moon some inexplicable force of cinema pushes all sanity and sense of aesthetics aside and leaves me defenselessly embracing a movie that has no apparent redeeming factor other than its cheesy eccentricity.
3040	Though, overall, it lacks the charm of its predecessor, Ralph Breaks the Internet is still a very good sequel from the most unlikely of characters.
3041	Talk about fear of flying ...
3042	Not that the film itself isn't funny, it most definitely is, but it is a formless mass of crazy one-liners and ridiculous situations.
3043	The bottom line is that it delivers all the excitement and adventure it promises.
3044	As films about people with devastating diseases go, Still Alice is understated, thought-provoking, and written and directed with a steady hand.
3045	Fincher pushes the tale of serial killing to the blackest depths of noir depravity.
3046	A toxic love letter to hate.
3047	There is a nice mix of humour and pathos here. Barnyard may not be all that exceptional, but it is quite satisfying.
3048	David Fincher never lets his movie devolve into a petty revenge fantasy. The filmmaker clearly got the novel and, consequently, gets the most out of the novel. Girl with the Dragon Tattoo is just what the fans were demanding.
3049	The result is as scarring and engrossing as it is fascinating, infuriating and profound.
3050	The film is loud, improbable, manufactured within an inch of its life, and takes absolutely no real risks with the franchise. If you want action movie comfort food, This might be your movie. Otherwise go watch Annihilation again.
3051	Not exactly a triumphant return to form for maverick director William Friedkin, but it's not bad, either.
3052	The Hobbit plays younger and lighter than Fellowship and its follow-ups, but does right by the faithful and has a strength in Martin Freeman's Bilbo that may yet see this trilogy measure up to the last one. There is treasure here.
3053	A lot better than the Muzak it threatens to be, but, ultimately, not good enough to keep our itchy fingers off the dial.
3054	A collection of gags that come together in a feel good finale, rather than a cohesive story, The Angry Birds Movie still has its moments, some of which may have you chuckling for days.
3055	When the Four finally use their different powers together to fight Doctor Doom, it's enough to get you past the torpor of Origin Movie Syndrome and make you hope for a sequel that gets right down to business.
3056	With it's likeable band of rogue heroes, comedic situations and standout performances is a great way to spend two hours.
3057	The occasional Steve Carell aside, comedians aren't often given the opportunity to flex their dramatic muscles, so it's nice to see the hilarious Tina Fey playing it straight.
3058	Returns the original's cast and director, and retains that film's winning combination of limitless imagination and exhilarating adventure.
3059	If the movie provides no new insight into the contrasting behavior of men and women or the perils of postmodern urban dating, falling well shy of the not-too-high standard set by 'Sex and the City' on both fronts, it does have its tart, fizzy moments.
3060	No matter how confused the story gets or how unclear Jim's motivations are, we still have Long John Silver, whose is-he-good- or-is-he-bad complexity is so fascinating that he'll make us stick around for any movie he yo-ho-hos in.
3061	The movie's biggest surprise is Timberlake, who finds the heart and soul of the not-so-tough Frankie and makes him the film's most complete character.
3062	Tony-winner Dan Fogler, as Cook's childhood friend, is embarrassingly foul, and even criminally cute Jessica Alba is wasted, playing Cook's painfully clumsy gal pal/penguin nut in this alternately warm and ugly ball of whacks.
3063	It's mostly to Cumberbatch's credit that The Imitation Game plays like a solid, engaging historical drama, interesting enough to suit audiences that aren't interested in either World War II history or technology.
3064	There's nothing particular strong or telling about its comedy.
3065	Rob Marshall's movie version has a harder time hiding the ripeness. And it's a bit like a geisha's persona -- visually exciting and emotionally remote.
3066	On the surface Silver Linings Playbook is a raucous romantic comedy, but its real interests are superstition and delusion.
3067	The pinnacle of McDonagh's directorial career so far.
3068	Either a highly erotic art film trading in sex, power and morality, or a trashy porno pretending to be deep. After watching two hours of hot young French women having sex with men, each other and themselves, I have to go with the latter.
3069	Flies high above the crowd for its worldly wit and compassion for humankind.
3070	This one's effective in portions, but falls short of holding your undivided attention.
3071	There's material here to sustain a solid franchise if the demand is there.
3072	Has all the makings of a cult film.
3073	Gladiator is visually magnificent, absolutely stunning to look at -- and to listen to, with its haunting, stirring score.
3074	The debutant director is done no favours by a screenplay from Vince Vaughn and Jon Favreau which gives him little to play with and them few chances to shine as actors.
3075	Flightplan establishes a solid enough takeoff, but with such unnecessary distractions, even Foster can't save it from crashing.
3076	"The closest a real-life movie has ever gotten to ""Seinfeld""'s ""Death Blow."" "
3077	Nice little rip-off of 'The Graduate.' Actually holds up on its own.
3078	Maybe it's all too wonderful to be true, but that's OK. If Taking Woodstock is a fantasy, then it's a most benevolent one, and more power to it.
3079	One of the better films you'll see this fall.
3080	This is a film in which the cast has so much fun that the audience can't help but have fun as well.
3081	I've seen comedies with fewer laughs than Body of Evidence, and this is a movie that isn't even trying to be funny.
3082	Despite a good cast and a short running time, Blumhouse Productions' latest micro-budget pic doesn't have the alluring franchise pull of some of its other films.
3083	Bland biopic about runners
3084	When Lawrence and Cooper are together, their chemistry jumps and sparks and their rat-a-tat psycho-banter aims for Cary Grant and Rosalind Russell territory.
3085	The second installment is scarier, darker, longer and even better than the first. It's an enchanting, enthralling, eye-popping miracle of moviemaking.
3086	If a gladiator film doesn't work as spectacle or as bloodthirsty action, what's left? Drama? It's dead on that level, too...
3087	Hope is a powerful thing and Safety Not Guaranteed delivers in its tale of longing, deliverance and connection during the here and now.
3088	The cinematography is lush, the Randy Newman score is so epic that Hollywood uses it for practically every movie trailer that isn't a Chris Tucker comedy or a Shaft remake, and the period detail, and baseball scenes, are top notch.
3089	As a character study, the film works very well. As a romance or drama, however, it is nearly inert.
3090	Among other things, Mr. Herzog visually dazzles us while he's pulling the rug from under our feet.
3091	How High isn't just the title of this new ganja comedy, it's a question of how chemically altered you should be before you walk into the theater.
3092	As presented, Wilmot is so vulgar that he doesn't care even for himself until the final reel, and few people will care to follow his story that far. 
3093	I just had fun at John Carter. Stupid, old school, science fiction fun. It's the kind of science fiction that doesn't get bogged down in the science part and fully embraces the fiction.
3094	It turns out, though, that a woman can save any marriage with a little home cooking and extra sex.
3095	Trend setter, nostalgic, feel good hit
3096	Powerful, lingering.
3097	Two great performances overcome the stereotypes and sometimes sloppy aesthetics of this formulaic feel-good boxing picture. 
3098	Spacey takes such palpable delight in being a suave hard-ass that it's impossible not to like him.
3099	For its imagination, audacity and willingness to tick off absolutely everyone, Team America is the most memorable comedy you'll see this year -- at least among the ones starring puppets.
3100	Its corny streak brings the movie too close to cut-rate Chinese Opera epics than should be allowed.
3101	Crimson Peak is a film more concerned with style than characters and the mystery/romance/horror plot; despite an interesting theme, the characters are thin and the plot is predictable.
3102	Defies logic as many times as it defies physics.
3103	"A Western with potential for feminist table-turning and old-fashioned violence, ""Jane Got a Gun"" is a major letdown. Despite being co-produced by Portman, the movie sells her character short at nearly every turn."
3104	Those chirpy chipmunks are back and your tolerance for Alvin and his buds in Alvin and the Chipmunks: The Road Chip may depend entirely on whether you are watching with children or not.
3105	Though not very deep in deep space, I thought Red Planet was pretty good fun.
3106	Before Sunrise/Sunset for baby boomers, your enjoyment of Paris Can Wait will depend on your tolerance for food porn, the French countryside and seemingly charming Gallic men.
3107	Passable movie entertainment, but like most future in-laws leaves a feeling of something still desired.
3108	"What with all the holiday hubbub, you certainly don't have time for ""Timeline,"" a lackluster sci-fi flick that would have been more at home as a television original."
3109	If Peter Jackson couldn't tell this slight story in a single film there's no hope the other two in this prequel series will be any less bloated.
3110	Has its moments, but too heavy-handed and predictable.
3111	It's immediately refreshing in its unabashed flow of feeling, but it also wields a cumulative punch.
3112	Younger kids probably will dig Minors like we dug The Goonies.
3113	The effects work here doesn't break any incredible new ground or shatter any records, and yet this is one of the most visually impressive movies I have ever seen.
3114	For a filmmaker who wants to create an adaptation of the story of Jesus, Mel Gibson's motives seem ironically impure.
3115	Slower out of the gates than a three-legged donkey... but it gets better, and fans won't mind this slowburn beginning because, hey, it's Middle Earth.
3116	What it fails to do is tell a coherent story, as everything about this exaggerated tale is hopelessly lost in a sea of silliness and generalities.
3117	The sci-fi cityscapes are gleaming, the action energetic and entertaining.
3118	Kubrick's second feature shows his promise as a powerful and iconic director in motifs and style.
3119	Stiff adaptation buoyed by brilliant Berlin score
3120	The movie is so conventional that it ends up being just as cliched as the Hollywood filmmaking system it sends up.
3121	Doom borrows gimmicks from other sci-fi/horror movies -- and not very well -- without creating enough of its own to do the trick.
3122	Such an entertaining bundle of chaos that you can't help but love it.
3123	The half that's good involves watching Morgan Freeman hitting not only the cadences of Mandela's oratory but the Gandhi-like calm of the man.
3124	The lovelorn Hitchcock of this film's fantasies would be better off left on the cutting-room floor.
3125	Spielberg made the picture with sufficient professional gravitas to signal that he understood the line he was walking. But it is ultimately just a movie, and we all know that in a black-and-white film, chocolate syrup can be read as blood.
3126	"The soundtrack includes mostly new tunes, but the only country song that kept racing through my increasingly bored mind was Willie Nelson's ""Wake Me When It's Over."
3127	A failure as satire -- a failure as a political thriller and a failure as an ill-conceived romance. That's three failures in the space of one movie.
3128	Hannibal Rising is a slick and horrifying ride you are forced to experience at the edge of a knife. Washed out scenes ease your senses in counterpoint to high contrast visuals depicting the worst things human beings are capable of.
3129	The Tourist gets sillier as the plot crawls along, its pace so slow that the movie could well put Ambien out of business once it starts showing up on late-night cable TV.
3130	...winsomely clever...
3131	The movie ends up being like Frankenstein's monster before the lightning shock -- it's a lot of pieces sewn together that are lifeless.
3132	Vastly entertaining biopic on one of the great directors of trash films.
3133	Its mixture of slapstick humour and gore -- produced by the flying fingers -- gives new meaning to the phrase digital effects.
3134	Different for Girls staggers around, keeping its lovers apart as in any conventional romantic comedy.
3135	[A] funny, sorrowful, richly layered and tremendously moving film.
3136	Not only does the film treat its characters with respect and without condescension, it does so even when their actions border on the indefensible.
3137	Burton, Elfman and director Henry Selick, whose camera movements are more inventive than most live-action pictures, have certainly created one of the most surprisingly unique films to come along in many a full moon.
3138	With a lesser actor, The Imitation Game would have collapsed on its good intentions. Cumberbatch brings such a raw personal passion to his work, he elevates the better parts to a superb level and keeps the miscues to a minimum.
3139	"Part ""Eraserhead"" and part ""Naked Lunch,"" ""Barton Fink"" is like whitefish on sand."
3140	There comes a moment in all truly terrible movies when you sense that you couldn't possibly be co-existing on the same planet as the filmmakers.
3141	Either real life is becoming more like a movie, or sports movies inspired by a true story exist in their own form of reality.
3142	No matter how bad a movie with A-list actors involved is, it will still be released - somewhere, sometime, to someone.
3143	In the end, the great charm of the film is that it will seduce fans... and football opponents alike. [Full review in Spanish]
3144	Bardem, as the man with the odd, long, bowl-cut/pageboy hair and a powerful air compressor that a lesser murderer might give a cute nickname to, is the single most chilling human being to inhabit a movie about death in Texas since Leatherface.
3145	The clever script by first-time screen writer Steven Katz manages to eschew gore and rely instead on a wickedly humorous relationship between Murnau and the vampire.
3146	...there's not much here worth recommending...
3147	A well-crafted character study which just might land the talented Benedict Cumberbatch a coveted Academy Award.
3148	What if this lesser-known chapter of German resistance had been more deeply captured? What if the moral conflicts running through this movie about love of country and revolt said more about Germany, war and, yes, genocide?
3149	No Country For Old Men bears McCarthy's unmistakable stamp, and the equally unmistakable mark of filmmakers Joel and Ethan Coen, making a strong return after a few years off.
3150	A sweet-natured tale about animals and new beginnings that you'll want to see with your kids.
3151	It's clear that no one's creative juices were really flowing on this project. Not even trickling.
3152	Agreeably alluring.
3153	It looks great, but a weak script, lacklustre acting and silly relationships drag it down.
3154	An early stunner from Jean-Luc Godard and one of the seminal films of the French New Wave.
3155	So bad, it's bad.
3156	The plot trundles along in a homely way... but never generates anything truly remarkable.
3157	The plot synopsis sounds less like sitcom than sick-com: A womanizer has the tables turned on him when he falls in love with, essentially, a prostitute whose services are being paid for by parents who don't have the decency to ask him to leave.
3158	David O. Russell's smarty-pants head-trip, which aims to provoke discussion of big questions by wrapping them in hipster laughs, begins with a sputtering burst of profanity and ends up struggling in the sticky strands of its own elaborate contrivances.
3159	In the end, the two halves of the movie feel as if they are forced together, leaving messes that Tennant and screenwriter Kevin Bisch never really clean up.
3160	Get out the Game Boy instead.
3161	A laughless, gadget-geared and poop-obsessed kid comedy based on a Lois Duncan book, it will sorely test any parent hoping to have a few laughs with the kids and make it home without a side trip to the Humane Society.
3162	A must-see for clown haters.
3163	Murnau is probably spinning in his grave.
3164	I truly enjoyed it from start to finish.
3165	Let's make it simple. Mystic River is the great Hollywood studio film released this year.
3166	An amusing enough, moderately clever movie, but most of it is rather one-note.
3167	With casting like this, I'd rather see the movie than read the book. At least in the case of one spy novelist.
3168	Will have you howling with laughter, unable to stop even to catch breath.
3169	A fine example of the Kurosawa style...precision of narrative in both scripting and imagistic storytelling... [Blu-ray]
3170	Samuel Jackson returns to form behind a long string of disappointing performances as an ethically minded basketball coach at a tough inner city high school in Richmond, California.
3171	Video game adaptation is bloody but boring.
3172	Characters are too boorish to care about.
3173	So ferociously acted and executed that it practically takes a bite out of you. You won't believe how great it is.
3174	Jae-eun Jeong's Take Care of My Cat brings a beguiling freshness to a coming-of-age story with such a buoyant, expressive flow of images that it emerges as another key contribution to the flowering of the South Korean cinema.
3175	Liljeberg is a talented young actress, perceptively playing all of Agnes's moods.
3176	That rare animated film that can easily please all age groups.
3177	Vertigo ultimately comes off as a fairly disastrous misfire that's almost entirely devoid of engrossing, attention-grabbing elements.
3178	The real chemistry isn't between Smith and Mendes, it's between Smith and James.
3179	This charming, futuristic family flick has enough firepower to overcome an awkward premise and Nicolas Cage's general creepiness.
3180	A miserable experience filled with crude slapstick, cruder sentiment and retrograde jokes.
3181	The Devil may have all the best tunes, but this really is the worst sort of cinematic karaoke.
3182	The best thing about Philip Seymour Hoffman's directing debut: It stars Philip Seymour Hoffman.
3183	A movie so literal that the character who wears an eye patch is named Patch, and where everything that happens is spelled out with the subtlety of a first-grade teacher introducing the alphabet.
3184	Could have been dumb fun...unfortunately, the filmmakers succeed in getting only the dumb part right, omitting the fun entirely.
3185	Shults's film is many things-heart-wrenching, paced to perfection, a masterclass in visual storytelling and genuinely terrifying-but that nothing about it feels beyond the grasp of what Shults wants it to be, of what he knows it can be.
3186	We went to this movie to laugh. Instead, we left yearning for a baby to cuddle. Ew.
3187	Philip Seymour Hoffman's directorial debut is a showcase for four passionate, authentic performances.
3188	Confirms that the RomCom is not really dead. 
3189	Not since The Sixth Sense has a film built up the horror and suspense so effectively.
3190	Essentially a series of street races.
3191	Once you open Pandora's Box, there's simply no stopping the beasts that pour out.
3192	... the familiarity gives it the elemental power of a fairy tale.
3193	American Psycho vibrates between being deliriously funny and just plain delirious.
3194	Just as Harry and friends are fighting the forces of darkness, the film's great elements are struggling toward the spotlight.
3195	In dramatic terms, constantly being told about Rochester's talent but never seeing it makes the movie feel as pointless as its subject's life.
3196	As it plays out, the brutality brings about more numbing revulsion than the revelatory empathy that Mel Gibson intends.
3197	A disappointing outing, despite its many laughs and inside jokes.
3198	Extraordinarily ambitious and effacingly accomplished, this is both an affecting domestic drama and a provocative political epic that is never anything less than intimate, intelligent and involving.
3199	Savagely dull, though at least it is tremendously incompetent as well, and thus marginally amusing, especially when the shark is actually onscreen.
3200	Tim and Eric's Billion Dollar Movie isn't for everyone, but for the few, the brave, it's extremely strange and hilarious.
3201	This has been clearly aimed at - pardon the pun - diehard action film fans. Anyone else, who might expect a vague sense of irony, will be sorely disappointed.
3202	There is enough good and good-spirited about Evelyn -- beginning with the performances by Brosnan and Vavasseur -- to forgive its more treacly moments.
3203	This is a strong, fast, and sexy action story that gives us something different from the Bond films we have seen before.
3204	Whatever your favorite moment, it'd be hard to deny that Shanghai Noon is anything less than a rootin'-tootin', chop-sockin' hoot.
3205	An overbudgeted, underscripted, lazy piece of work
3206	A superbly crafted movie, with knowing dialogue, fine performances and characters that you grow to care deeply for.
3207	There hasn't been a Hollywood 'message' movie as smug or cheesy as The Next Best Thing in quite a while.
3208	Pretty funny star vehicle.
3209	This is a text-book example of top-grade ghoulish horror from Hammer's golden era.
3210	A don't-miss future classic, Spy Kids is aimed at children but the entire family will enjoy its pro-family message and the cheesy-fun effects that'll make you want to be a kid again.
3211	Director Bill Duke has no idea how to shape or visualize it, turning it into a mushy mess with far too much loud music to drive home the emotions.
3212	While it is not a work that will change the world, Love, Simon will indeed mean the world to any viewers living through the same trials, tribulations and unnecessarily solitary soul-searching as its teen protagonist.
3213	Like most slasher films, Wrong Turn is not especially scary, though it does achieve a few moments of mild suspense.
3214	When viewed today seems to be in need of a buffing.
3215	Elevates what might have been an adolescent adventure story...with good taste, high-mindedness and elegence, even if the result is just a bit prosaic and emotionally detached.
3216	A fitting follow-up to American Werewolf
3217	Small pleasures aside, the movie doesn't offer anything particularly memorable or inventive.
3218	Terrible conclusion of the trilogy. The first two were great comic/cartoon adaptations. But back in time? What the hell is that about?
3219	Martin McDonagh's film style, combining ultra-violence and comedy, isn't a gimmick but pertinent in achieving his thematic goal of addressing complicity.
3220	[The] elements are in place again, but the story feels less substantial than the Lord of the Rings tales.
3221	The Good Girl only pretends to care about good people who sometimes do bad things. In fact, it hasn't got time for the pain.
3222	A grimly saccharine and interminably trite sea-sodden weepie.
3223	Everything about it bears the stench of amateurs, from the unspectacular special effects to the sitcom-lame dialogue to the butchered storyline.
3224	As far as I can tell, the moral of Country Strong seems to be: mothers, don't let your kids grow up to sing country music. Good advice. That said, the music is easily the best part of the movie, and I don't even like country music.
3225	...unnerving, but never cynical. Violent but never gratuitous....an odd little film with a cracked heart .
3226	"Bringing someone back from the dead is one of the horror genre's oldest and most effective tropes, but with ""The Lazarus Effect,"" it just seems tired."
3227	If it's just meant to be a competent bit of historical drama, it does that well enough.
3228	Projected in digital format with booming, all-encompassing sound, Blade Runner: The Final Cut is a marvel of technology and dedication. As a film it's still the same dead-eyed pretty girl who looks good on your arm but is a real bore over dinner.
3229	High-minded and ambitious, Agora is also resplendent and rich, full of striking images.
3230	The film built around Depp's performance is leaden and monotonous, crusted in the faux-realism of handheld cameras, muddy streets, and dingy castle hallways.
3231	...a gloomy mishmash of ideas that never comes together and is hardly ever fun to watch.
3232	Will convince you that you'd be better off taking the train.
3233	Alfred Hitchcock's control of the audience is most complete in Vertigo.
3234	Even with its flaws, I, Robot still computes to being a warm-weather winner.
3235	Resentments, pregnancies, cancer, spousal abuse and the struggle of a recovering alcoholic all come and go on cue.
3236	Seeing Black Nativity is like an early Christmas gift. The best thing that to say about this powerful story brought to life by a first-rate cast is hallelujah.
3237	Underwater slimies eat everyone. A sly sense of humor helps immeasurably.
3238	Breezy, breathless, brainless fun.
3239	The Curious Case of Benjamin Button is the total package, a deftly assembled fairy tale that unspools like a pleasant dream.
3240	There's probably a sweet little comedy hidden somewhere in Orange County. It's just too bad it's mired amidst so many small-minded pratfalls.
3241	Though this period drama is meant to be thought-provoking and prompt intriguing queries about gender, it leaves too many questions unanswered.
3242	The documentary details in no-nonsense, talking-head style how commercial and investment banks moved high-risk mortgages out into the economy, dumping debt and reaping profits in the process.
3243	"Hoffman secures success with the pairing of leads Clement and Gould, who pull off an itchy family dynamic with terrific timing, bringing heart and laughs to ""Humor Me."
3244	Not funny or romantic; too raunchy for all ages.
3245	The proceedings mainly revolve around sexual and bathroom humour, and - depending on your tastes - this will either quickly grow tiresome, or will entertain you endlessly.
3246	A stylishly steamy tale of passion and revenge.
3247	A melodramatic clash of ideologies and a warm, deeply moving third act lift Mao's Last Dancer above politics and into the realm of emotion, art and beauty.
3248	Nostalgic and achingly beautiful, this is Allen's best since Husbands And Wives.
3249	Lavishly mounted Western by Jacques Tourneur, better known for his noir films
3250	A nutty film that boasts at times beautiful photography of some cheap but truly epic sets of PVC and everything that clings.
3251	As the record of a cultural event, Soul Power is a hit-and-miss affair.
3252	Boseman's performance comes bounding in with such wicked attitude, and such a showman's determination to give us a good time, it's hard to harbour regrets for long.
3253	While it appears all-too-obvious, there's an awful lot going on with fully filled out characters abrasively rubbing along.
3254	Though messy and overlong, it's an enjoyable throwback to the movie spectacles of a more innocent age.
3255	Anthony Hopkins, superb actor although he is, would not seem to be an obvious choice to play Hitchcock, but I accepted him. His makeup job is transformative. 
3256	Ed Harris is as good as he's ever been as a taciturn convict, and the unsparing depiction of the depths to which the travellers sink hints at the punishing hymn to endurance the film might have been.
3257	Rango is the revitalising injection of new blood that animated cinema didn't know it needed.
3258	Another stunning martial arts masterpiece from Yimou Zhang.
3259	The episodic film makes valid points about the depersonalization of modern life. But the characters tend to be cliches whose lives are never fully explored.
3260	Though the smash-bang chases make for dumb fun, it all mostly cruises in a noisy neutral. And with his film clocking in at over two hours, director Justin Lin might have raised his own speed limit.
3261	Part of the pleasure to be had from Hell or High Water is watching all concerned turn such assumptions on their heads.
3262	Fate, mortality, life and death, all of this is explored in a beautifully crafted film without seeping into sentimentality.
3263	The filmmakers have taken a trashy, overheated story of court intrigue and sexual duplicity and sucked the life out of it.
3264	It feels like three years to get to a point of resolution. Bandslam should take the lead of the rock gods: keep it moving, keep it simple, and know when to get off the stage.
3265	Has a promising premise.
3266	There's an ethereal quality to Guadagnino's work that shapes its every moment. The story unfolds as if in a dream, a memory of a sun-swept time when the promise of love emerged and brought with it all that's terrible and wonderful in the world.
3267	As anticlimactic as an actual breakup, without any of the passion, the anger or the glimmers of hope that come from gradually parting with someone you love.
3268	I'm sure it will do decent business among the undemanding weekend-horror crowd and Zellweger fans when it eventually sees the light of day. Nobody else need apply.
3269	It's a great war farce because it's confident enough in its emotions and convictions to focus on the laughs, knowing you'll get the message anyway.
3270	A wasted opportunity to breathe fresh life into the Marvel universe's long-stodgy elder statesmen. 
3271	A documentary that is at times awesome and at times meditative on how one faces the question of life or death in the face of disaster.
3272	Hazanavicius films with a precision rarely seen. [Full review in Spanish]
3273	Into the Wild shows you the way, but lets you choose for yourself. And hippie or no, this trip is absolutely worth the effort.
3274	Miss Mirren, through a reserve that disappears layer by layer, makes Marcella a woman of unexpected substance and generosity, one who is no more comfortable with the pain and paradoxes of Northern Ireland than Cal is himself.
3275	Whenever the film leaves the court, it stumbles
3276	The climax sent me out of the theatre scratching my head, and even though I enjoyed the majority this isn't exactly the sort of reaction I'm guessing the writer/director was hoping for.
3277	Seventeen gets that being young can feel like The Hunger Games without the prizes; at least there's always hope - and graduation - on the other side.
3278	Oyelowo is the real deal, monumental in a film that isn't, muscling a middling historical drama into something absolutely worth seeing.
3279	Toys are us.
3280	Gorgeously filmed in Death Valley.
3281	Don't expect to crack up at The Break-Up.
3282	The plot underlies even the most inexplicable scenes and eventually links even the most widely separated characters, but what makes the movie fun is the dialogue and the behavior.
3283	It's occasionally brilliant but never seems comfortable.
3284	The darkness in this comedy is exactly what makes it work so well.
3285	Project Nim certainly tugs on the heartstrings but the movie earns it because the story is so unique. 
3286	Pitched somewhere been the swagger of James Bond and the out there ambience of Willy Wonka, Spy Kids is a real treat.
3287	The result is a fresh, feel-good crowd-pleaser that pokes affectionate fun at fairytale conventions while remaining true to their spirit.
3288	The movie succeeds at many moments even while pursuing its doomed grand design.
3289	A brilliant film that plays like a chain of linked short short stories.
3290	A straight-ahead matinee actioner, all bark and bite but little soul.
3291	The numerous making-of featurettes includes a treat for those of us in eastern Massachusetts with the Burlington Mall highlighted...
3292	The Rover is not meant for everyone, but it's worth consideration if you don't mind getting lost in David Marchad's bleak Australian future for a couple hours.
3293	"A lightweight attempt to emulate the satiric approach to the Western genre already perfected by Mel Brooks with ""Blazing Saddles."" "
3294	Despite its flaws, The Imitation Game watchably recreates one of Britain's finest hours, and one of its most shameful.
3295	When it was all over, I could easily proclaim The Chamber of Secrets as a vastly superior film on every level, one that I'll be willing to devote more time to again and again in the future.
3296	Was a great film during the Cold War.
3297	With the foul-mouthed, largely feminine dramedy Friends with Kids, writer/producer/director/star Jennifer Westfeldt is juggling so much, it's a wonder there aren't more jokes about balls.
3298	Reuniting, or really, introducing, the gang is a gimmick. It's also self-destructive-cramming in all these characters chokes up the plot, and who watches a Step Up for the plot? 
3299	The power of Lost in Translation is in the way it sneaks up on you.
3300	The advantage of a postapocalyptic setting is that it can be made on the cheap. Any rock pile will do for a set. Reign of Fire has the disadvantage of also looking cheap.
3301	Its originality and sheer wacked-out likability compensate for its weaknesses in pacing.
3302	More boos-and-body-fluid yucks from the Wayans brothers.
3303	Sienna Miller shows impressive range in Factory Girl, but range isn't necessarily what the part requires.
3304	Lots of laughs...all unintended
3305	The movie feels like a form of aversion therapy designed to take the fun out of dumb.
3306	If you love movies, you've got a little Ed Wood inside you.
3307	There are some impressive special effects, but the picture is more a charming character study than a futuristic adventure.
3308	He knows there's so much drama and emotion in the story, it doesn't need schmaltzy dialogue or actors begging us to cry.
3309	...a strangely uninvolving thriller...
3310	The Ring is a mind-bending blast of eerie atmospherics and trippy visuals.
3311	It stars a horribly miscast Meg Ryan in another of her awkward attempts to broaden her acting horizons.
3312	Hedlund's got a hell of a voice, rotgut-ragged, and whether he's crooning or wooing, whatever he's selling, and no matter how cornpone, I'm buying.
3313	Watching [Wilson] mug wildly in another uneven film short on plot, the audience may start to wish he would go away for awhile and stop turning up in such repetitive comedies.
3314	Though his engagement of silent idiom recalls Chaplin, his leisurely pacing brings to mind Jarmusch.
3315	Soderbergh directs with his trademark pace and panache, but to this he adds an obvious affection for his hapless hillbilly heroes.
3316	The talky script, by the movie's director Preston A. Whitmore II, is delivered with all the flair of bad community theater.
3317	Rene's got the undivided attention of the audience right beside her the whole time, and even solidly emotionally touched by her invisible world.
3318	"There's a sense of innocence and ingenuity and a central wholesomeness that remains throughout the film. ""Early Man"" is escapist fun."
3319	A teen movie that strikes all the right chords.
3320	A shoddily-made documentary, with many scenes looking like fifth generation copies of bad videotapes ... The film is for Tupac's dyed-in-the-wool fans only.
3321	Gritty, dark and unapologetically violent, Land of the Dead is a solid, serious zombie movie.
3322	It's the Hook formula, rendered in basic, gentle tones, deprived of any personality except in the form of Winnie-the-Pooh.
3323	All I can say is that I am now dreading Part Six and looking to Part Seven with something resembling vague optimism, especially if all involved can use the time to steal a better and tighter plot along the way.
3324	... Seth Rogen and Katherine Heigl have great chemistry onscreen and they are hysterical together.
3325	Why does the token black kid have to be comic relief?
3326	All the characters get in fights but, SPOILER ALERT, everything ends with hugs, violins, good wishes and warm hearts.
3327	An expert and truly unpredictable blend of comedy and menace.
3328	seemingly prosaic spectacle of poker game as the contest of epic proportions
3329	It'd take a considerably more charming pair of leads to salvage a concept this lame and a screenplay this witless.
3330	"Irked by the endless will they/won't they, girl tells boy: ""This is really painful."" After close to two hours of fairly unremarkable viewing, at that point the feeling is mutual."
3331	Nevertheless, this is a charming, engaging movie.
3332	Absolutely one of the funniest films of the year, and also one of the most deeply sad
3333	If this movie ever figured out what it wanted to be when it grows up, it would be a terrific one.
3334	Woo is in fine form.
3335	A few nice moments does not a movie make.
3336	A long way from high art. Or even high schlock.
3337	Director Milos Forman ... gives Tom Hulce free reign to portray the world's most sublime composer as a drunken, selfish fool giggling his way into the ears of Vienna.
3338	It's simply zany, silly, forgettable fun.
3339	The film does have a small mystery in it, but it is easily solvable and plays only a small part in the plot.
3340	...despite its storytelling creativity, it doesn't generate as much inspiration or excitement as I would have expected.
3341	... on target and godlike.
3342	It is equally political and broadly universal and applicable in its aim of dramatising an unexpected trace of love that might be true and worth following.
3343	Welcome to Mooseport is the movie equivalent of a bowl of unadorned oatmeal: It's bland, a bit lumpy and, though it'll tide you over until something better comes along, you won't look back fondly on the experience.
3344	Russell hasn't yet developed enough filmmaking savvy to juggle so many intellectual, emotional, and narrative elements.
3345	There's a fresh mound of metaphysical content to mull over, and in the end, that's the only thing that redeems this somewhat unsatisfying horror experiment: We're forced to think about what we might do in the same situation...
3346	A duet, with two master performers collaborating in absorbing harmony.
3347	Gives the viewer some insight on Native American culture. That is a lot more than most westerns have to offer on this subject.
3348	Manages to create a winning Caribbean vibe that stretches into a fun popcorn flick.
3349	This is a sobering, well-observed film that doesn't fully hit the mark but sets up enough pleasing ideas to chew on regarding ambition, marriage and ideals of how to live one's life, individually and as a couple.
3350	so exaggerated that it veers wildly and awkwardly into pure, outlandish farce
3351	They've cranked it up another couple notches for Crank: High Voltage, with mixed results.
3352	Methodical, moving at its own unhurried pace, content to revel in silence and the mundane minutia of surviving in a world no longer filled with modern amenities, Shults shows the same attention to detail he [displayed in Krisha].
3353	They crammed a lot of bad, bad stuff into such a short flick.
3354	A real shame that this isn't a good movie.
3355	The Infiltrator is solid entertainment made even better by Cranston.
3356	Falls flatter than, well, a Hollywood comedy release in January.
3357	It's another example of MacFarlane's ability to mix poop jokes with romance, foul language with sweet sentiment, offensive humor with boyish charm.
3358	You'll certainly find bracingly funny moments scattered throughout an amusing tale that benefits with the sprightly insouciance adopted by a filmmaker who has nothing to prove.
3359	...an utterly incompetent comedic affair...
3360	Shot in just over a week and provides the writer-director with a larger collection of personalities to send careening against each other. 
3361	The issues that happened behind the camera, including the original directors leaving the project, are extremely obvious in the final product. The film is a complete disaster.
3362	Julia Roberts boasts a charming presence and a lively mind but she deserves better than this superficial, glitzy and fluffy travelogue of self discovery, which has lots of food, some prayers but little love or sex.
3363	...a finely etched character piece that does not disrespect the people that the time betrayed.
3364	In all its corny mayhem, Surf Ninjas manages to have some fun mixed in with the parts that wipe out.
3365	...the scene featuring the princesses dispelling their girly pre-Me Too-era images is worth the price of admission alone.
3366	It doesn't even make good camp.
3367	It's all quite implausible and the mindless, contrived ending is infuriating.
3368	Stylistically it's a beauty, with khaki-uniformed waifs fighting for their lives to a crashing classical score.
3369	This is a mighty scary horror film, one of the best pure sit-in-the-dark-and-tell-a-scary-story movies to come down the pike in quite some time.
3370	Another brilliantly conceived examination of the human condition by the modern master of such fare. 
3371	You might not buy all of it, but you still enjoy getting tweaked by every twist of its goose-flesh-inducing storytelling.
3372	Boring and unnecessary sequel, some shark attacks. 
3373	Timothy Olyphant, Milla Jovovich, Kiele Sanchez and Steve Zahn topline a playful take on the psycho killer couple thriller
3374	Eckhart can act - as he proved in Thank You For Smoking, The Dark Knight and The Rum Diary - but he has little to work with here.
3375	The way the group finally steals the test and how they use it is really, really ridiculous and a complete cop-out.
3376	Sienna Miller is perfectly cast but the script barely scratches the surface and you never really get inside any of the characters.
3377	Sadly, this is a movie about the consequences of debauchery, and about Johnny Depp making long-winded Oscar-bait speeches while slathered in nasty pancake makeup.
3378	Jesus stumbles under the weight of the cross so many times, you begin to swear the editors are recycling the same footage over and over again.
3379	Colliding police cruisers generate more sparks than Lawrence and Zahn, who create very little chemistry as a buddy team.
3380	First-rate western parody.
3381	You gotta love love, especially when it's devious, deceitful, selfish, brutal and manipulative.
3382	"Trainspotting"" manages to be hip, happening, graphic, tragic, violent, cool, filthy, sick, and very funny, and the tragically hip arthouse crowd on this side of the ocean are going to eat it up."
3383	This movie feels like it has a million jokes, and every single one arrives with a lethal thud.
3384	As delightfully odd and quirky as you might expect from an actor like Philip Seymour Hoffman, but it also has a strange tone that's hard to put one's finger on.
3385	A landscape where heart and head can collide in a great fury, and when the world felt like it could go one way or the other.
3386	"Those who know nothing about the history of cinema will not be shortchanged - ""The Artist"" can be enjoyed by anyone who loves what is essential about movies."
3387	So determined to one-up the boys that it goes overboard, misses its mark and accidentally makes an entirely different kind of statement.
3388	Chuck Norris' best film.
3389	The great strength of the film is that it never resorts to cheap sentimentality. The facts themselves are hard enough, crushing enough.
3390	Rather like an unsuitable partner, Couples Retreat starts out fun before gradually getting annoying and then becoming downright aggravating. While it's not the worst film ever, there are times when it feels as irritating as sunburn.
3391	Monster is a brave, unsettling film, a little rough around the edges but unflinching to the end.

3393	Even though 'Anger is not always the answer,' sometimes it has to be, or there's no movie, and here's where The Angry Birds Movie will divide audiences.
3394	The late Stan Seidel's script is overly talky and under-inspired.
3395	It is very, very clear from the evidence of the film that Payne loves Nebraska. It's Nebraskans that he apparently has a problem with.
3396	Seldom has a movie so blatantly illustrated the need for genuine star power in the lead, especially considering The Wedding Date's obvious comparisons to not one, but three more successful Julia Roberts movies.

3398	... a thoughtful examination of the attempt to adjust to a society that sees only what it wants to see ... 
3399	The film is powerful, accessible and funny. You won't miss its messages, but you'll be entertained as well.
3400	Rockwell is a hoot as Frankie, but during the stretches when he's not on screen, the air goes out of the film.
3401	Are your kids ready for an existential movie? Turns out they are: Disney's CGI-animated action comedy Bolt is, at its core, a story of one individual's discovery that his sense of reality...has been seriously skewed. [Blu-ray]
3402	Can't tell whether Mendes speaks through his characters or speaks about them
3403	An immensely enjoyable, if predictable, ride.
3404	It's as dumb and bad as it sounds.
3405	Twists and turns keep the story increasingly complex and gripping, even if director Liman doesn't really pump up the adrenaline.
3406	Hereafter is a solemnly reassuring film made by major talents working intriguingly outside their comfort zones.
3407	The first teaming of Tracy and Hepburn shows the chemistry between the stars, setting the pattern for future and better battle of the sexes romantic comedies.
3408	A few hitches, but they don't cock it up too much. 
3409	"Well-made and much more serious than it's being marketed, ""Whiskey Tango Foxtrot"" gives Tina Fey the chance to flex some acting chops you may not know she possessed"
3410	Enchanted squeaks by on the charm of its performers, particularly Adams.
3411	"World's End"" is easy to relate to, but it's the guys and the clever/silly script that make it so much fun."
3412	Despite Crowe's integrity and lightness of touch doesn't deliver the emotional experience of, say, Jerry Maguire or Almost Famous. Still, it is good to have the righteous dude back.
3413	a beautiful masterpiece... even though it's the hardest movie ever to watch
3414	"Campy end of the world movie. Funny in places, but I'd rather see a serious ""comet"" movie."
3415	Unfunny, and also casually offensive.
3416	What at first seems formulaic comedy gains a deeper resonance as we see how they represent two responses to cruelty and injustice -- first outrage, and with time, eventually, forgiveness.
3417	It ain't just hype; it really is a true holiday classic.
3418	Welcome to Mooseport has its share of clever ideas ... yet the picture is packaged with so little flair that's it's difficult to love.
3419	...a sweet, lighthearted, nostalgic look back at an era before the tube.
3420	a big selling point for my kids to see this movie was the line, 'I have machine guns... in my butt?' Viewer, be warned.
3421	Most viewers are powerless to resist the kinetic pleasures of this endlessly inventive action adventure.
3422	We knew Bening could do sexy, but this is newer terrain for Bell, who has played a few too many boys and bit parts in recent years.
3423	What ultimately makes the film so satisfying is the seriousness and affection with which Apatow treats his characters, no matter how drug-addled or misguided they may be.
3424	"Laudably manages to avoid the inherent sordidness of ""Pretty Woman"" and the underlying sadness of ""My Best Friend's Wedding."
3425	Soderbergh... remains a talented filmmaker with an instinctive gift for pacing and style. Cinephiles can rejoice that his self-imposed retirement seems to be over, even if he doesn't push himself too hard in this modest return.
3426	This well-crafted historical drama is a treat for Tudor history fans and everyone else who appreciates a lusty tale. 
3427	"Logan Lucky is a rarity on multiple levels, just as remarkable as what the film comes to call ""the Hillbilly Heist."" "
3428	Warmed-up John Huges pap. Not even the hard-working Ed O'Neill can save the day.
3429	Romance, action, humor, and even some philosophical gristle: Is war a cosmic constant? Is anything worth fighting for?
3430	It's a failure, but a well-done failure, and those are sometimes worth watching.
3431	Isn't the exercise in gross-out excess the first movie was, but its pairing of a tamer version of the old recipe with some laudable but imperfectly delivered PC messages makes for an alternately vulgar and tepid brew.
3432	a crackerjack Bond film that cannily mixes the harder, more severe edges of the previous Craig films with a sly sense of humor
3433	Excess for excess sake, or just bad taste: Caligula is a messy, bloody film that fails on any level, even as porn and camp.
3434	Though the film isn't exactly deep, Steinfeld makes it watchable and there's amusing support from Woody Harrelson as her wry teacher.
3435	While an admirable exercise in by-the-book filmmaking, it nevertheless lacks emotional depth.
3436	As a space thriller it works well enough, but as a film that tries to traverse and connect the Cloverfield universe my brain is exploding -- and not in a good way.
3437	The polemical is never as powerful as the personal and O'Grady's part of the story illuminates the whole with nauseating clarity.
3438	You'll have much better luck finding a good spot to surf in Wyoming than finding entertainment in Meet the Deedles.
3439	This is the kind of film that slowly gets under your skin, drawing you more intimately into the sad existence of the characters.
3440	A warm and even perceptive family film, not always original but undeniably sweet-natured.
3441	"If awards were handed out for the sloppiest movies, ""American Hustle"" would be a dead ringer for just such a booby prize. "
3442	Black Snake Moan is highly recommended for anyone who is tired of films with scripts that insult their intellect or that boast superficial performances by mediocre actors.
3443	Despite Levinson's split purpose, making it into a 'dramedy,' it's timely and thought-provoking.
3444	While some moments are magical, others just don't quite click.
3445	About on par with the first from a pure entertainment standpoint.
3446	Another sequel no one wanted.
3447	What Cianfrance can't do is find a definitive ending: the film has at least three as it builds to a high pitch and thus runs long. But along the way it's passionately gripping and much more than the cliche of a tear-jerking romance.
3448	All the cows have udders - even the male ones. In real life, only female cows have udders. What kind of sick, alternate cow universe does this movie take place in anyway?
3449	[Ethan] Hawke's performance is his most mature to date, a masterpiece of a man who cannot work himself out and yet is compelled to try.
3450	I just can't recommend it.
3451	Adams' performance is the kind that deserves an Academy Award nomination yet seldom gets one.
3452	So convincing is Chadwick Boseman's performance that one would think the spirit of James Brown itself jumped into Boseman's skin, such are the supernatural heights he achieves.
3453	Berg's intuitively right ratio of personal and analytical material, her implied belief in transcendence of horrific demoralization, shows a truly progressive vision.
3454	Mamet's somewhat original script almost succeeds in breathing new life into the genre ... before making a fatal miscalculation in plotting toward the end.
3455	There is undeniable pleasure in watching Depp have fun with a role, turning a character in an inferior movie into something worth treasuring. Still, it would be even more rewarding watching him work his magic in a good film.
3456	One factor, and one factor alone, brings 'How Do You Know?' to above average.
3457	While there is a serious subtext, cast and crew remember that this is essentially a frivolous comedy
3458	This material cobbles together elements of Westerns, space epics, new-age mysticism and even zombie-horror films. And it's to the credit of screenwriter/director Joss Whedon that it all feels cohesive, coherent and believable.
3459	It follows the same pattern of rise, fall, comeback, and redemption that has become so automatic for this particular subgenre that you can almost set your watch by the narrative beats.

3466	A compelling portrait of deeply rooted sexism and injustice dragging the nation back to a Bronze Age notion of women's rights.
3467	In the end, Jurassic Park succeeds because it's good entertainment.
3468	Trainspotting is supercharged with sulphurous humour and brutal recklessness: it charges at you like Ewan McGregor's Renton sprinting from store detectives in the opening sequence.
3469	It's cathartic to see stories we can relate to told with a degree of love and compassion that we can hardly imagine.
3470	...it has so many gadgets and gizmos in it that it sinks under its own weight.
3471	It's action opera, sword-and-sorcery song-and-dance, and it's a heart-pumping, jaw-dropping thrill.
3472	Not an easy watch, but required viewing for ambitious cinephiles.
3473	Will Smith and Kevin James keep the whole thing going thanks to the chemistry of their oddball pairing
3474	An excellent Aussie effort with ripper performances from Crowe and Thompson
3475	The DVD has some interesting special features with the best being the director talking about the deleted scenes and exactly why they were cut.
3476	While a good deal of Vertical Limit is undeniably by the numbers, it has become increasingly rare to see those digits whipped into this kind of shape.
3477	Fans of the game would rather play it themselves than watch someone else do it for them.
3478	The technical virtues of the film may outstrip the content, but it's an entertaining film, nonetheless. You might want to stay around for this one.
3479	For all the great work that goes into it, Monster gives no reason to invest any time trying to understand why this pathetic person took seven lives.
3480	Menashe the film is so intimate and so nuanced in its depiction of the woes of Menashe the character that there's really no need for anything else. 
3481	The board is set, the pieces are moving and we're set up nicely for Jackson to tighten the noose with the love of second-act grit he displayed in The Two Towers.
3482	There's the germ of a great idea in this premise, but it's flattened by sledgehammer direction that smashes any possibility out of each scene.
3483	a classic film with plenty of spunk
3484	It looks like a video game intro.
3485	The movie feels as empty as Alfie's heart.
3486	Opportunities to comment on the ethical grey areas of suicide are mostly squandered and, as the pointless digressions begin to pile up, your mind begins to drift from the action on screen.
3487	As interesting as the message is with this film, it is equally as hypocritical of the movie industry to shake its finger at fads, trendsetters and materialistic nonsense.
3488	An ode to the common man.
3489	Jane Camion's stunning feature debut is a bold and audacious dark comedy about sexual politics and dysfunctional family relations.
3490	Hawke masterfully places us inside the head of a man with a disintegrating soul, as he gradually loses a long-running battle with his demons.
3491	Expect plenty of raunchy moments and outrageous drunken situations. The story is a no-brainer too.
3492	It's better than you expect going in, but not quite good enough to leave you with more than a vaguely pleasant, vaguely disappointed aftertaste.
3493	Every so often a family movie comes along that will appeal to the whole family, and Spy Kids is one of those.
3494	Alien vs. Predator was a lot better.
3495	Tepid comedy.
3496	Not all rainbows and hugs -- some scares, too.
3497	One of John Ford's best pictures is also his most overtly romantic saga, set against picaresque Ireland, with top-notch turns from John Wayne and Maureen O'Hara. 
3498	It is an exercise in pure cynicism, with little respect for its subject -- or for its thriller plot, which I defy anyone to explain.
3499	Set on the one-year anniversary of the twin towers' collapse, the drama interweaves five stories about New Yorkers. It's a testament to the city's resolve to resume life as normal.
3500	This coming-of-age tale seems impossibly romanticized, yet somehow it still manages to remain grounded and truthful. 
3501	Decadence rules the day for Abel Ferrara's offbeat soft porn look at how the modern world has come up with a new criminal type -- the international corporate raider.
3502	one of Garbo's greatest hits, still a treat to watch
3503	It's playtime for viewers of all ages.
3504	Aggressively obnoxious FX comedy with Chase at his absolute hammiest.
3505	Ben Foster becomes cartoonish instead of scary. It feels like he is channeling Pauly Shore doing an Al Pacino impression.
3506	There's no denying the majesty in Peter Jackson's visuals but he's taken a relatively slim children's book and stretched it beyond the limits.
3507	Don't let my regret at the repression of Jackie's glorious insanity stop you from seeing Shanghai Noon - go and enjoy it.
3508	[Field gives] a beautiful performance, and it's hard to imagine anyone else being able to pull off the role.
3509	Alfred Hitchcock at his most disturbing.
3510	"Bet you're just itching to see ""Bee Movie.""This little honey was launched with an ad campaign possibly equal to the cost of launching a space shuttle ... bees have been everywhere."
3511	Mr. Fincher's impressive skill is evident, even as his ambitions seem to be checked by the limitations of the source material and the imperatives of commercial entertainment.
3512	"Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri"" is a powder keg of rage and raw emotion that deftly dances on the line between dark comedy and wrenching drama."
3513	Some humor in Bee Movie is too sophisticated for little kids, but there are enough dazzling action scenes to compensate. Youngsters won't get an allusion to The Graduate, but they'll enjoy the slapstick that follows.
3514	A clever situation-comedy that delivers quite a few laughs.
3515	Kontroll is that singular success, a thoroughly satisfying, rambunctious entertainment that also subtly works on philosophical and spiritual levels.
3516	Hotel for Dogs is a sweet, innocent family movie about stray dogs that seem as well-trained as Olympic champions.
3517	hrow in some snappy dialogue, a cute kid, a smart scientist and a tough-guy hero, and you've got the makings of a popcorn movie. That's what The Predator is, and what it aims to be.
3518	As Quaid, Schwarzenegger continues to stretch beyond his reach as an actor, relying on physical prowess to keep him in character.
3519	Ralph Breaks the Internet is bigger and more heartfelt, with some fun Disney nostalgia, but its story gets lost in the online setting at times.
3520	It's a wonderful film, all subtlety and grace, from the delicate script of writer-director Sofia Coppola to the finely tuned efforts of Bill Murray, who gives a still, laconic yet mesmerizing performance.
3521	It wants to be surprising but merely grows foolish.
3522	If Eminem is a genius then Tiny Tim must be God.
3523	An intriguing story brimming with possibilities is softened beyond all meaning by this glossy Hollywood production.

3525	An at-once horrifying and touching love story about the disenfranchised on whom society turns its back -- a segment of the population not portrayed often enough on film.
3526	Thirty-one years after the original eviscerated its way through a Central American jungle, fans finally have a worthy successor with The Predator.
3527	Mildly amusing at best, the interviews are accompanied by twee animated segments featuring paper dolls, which should fill any right-thinking person with disgust.
3528	Well meaning but wrong headed
3529	when I went to see Little Man, I laughed, then hung my head in shame. Are they going to take away my movie critic license? Will all of the other critics find out and ridicule me? Will they let me play in their movie critic games? 
3530	What hurts it is Spielberg's dogged insistence on turning it into yet another of his seemingly endless middle-brow meditations on the travails of the middle-class family.
3531	The children's thriller Spy Kids is just a glorified gizmo movie, but, as directed by the semigrown up Robert Rodriguez, the gizmos have a loopy, babes in toyland vivacity.
3532	Levelling up from the original with it's charming humour, smooth animation and lovable characters.
3533	Watching Cary Grant shuffle about like an angry, disheveled bum is funny to a degree that it wouldn't be for virtually any other actor who could have conceivably fit the role.
3534	Donner performs an appendectomy on the story with a rusty butter knife, butchering it in every way imaginable.
3535	The sheer audacity...is admirable, and often times very funny.
3536	Keep your expectations reasonable.
3537	A boisterous, semi-comic action thriller.
